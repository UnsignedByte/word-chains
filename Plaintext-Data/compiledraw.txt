you don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer ; but that ain't no matter .
that book was made by mr. mark twain , and he told the truth , mainly .
there was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth .
that is nothing .
i never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was aunt polly , or the widow , or maybe mary .
aunt pollytom's aunt polly , she isand mary , and the widow douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as i said before .
now the way that the book winds up is this : tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich .
we got six thousand dollars apieceall gold .
it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up .
well , judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year roundmore than a body could tell what to do with .
the widow douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when i couldn't stand it no longer i lit out .
i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again , and was free and satisfied .
but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable .
so i went back .
the widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it .
she put me in them new clothes again , and i couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up .
well , then , the old thing commenced again .
the widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time .
when you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there warn't really anything the matter with them ,that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself .
in a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better .
after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers , and i was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then i didn't care no more about him , because i don't take no stock in dead people .
pretty soon i wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me .
but she wouldn't .
she said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean , and i must try to not do it any more .
that is just the way with some people .
they get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it .
here she was abothering about moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it .
and she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .
her sister , miss watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spellingbook .
she worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up .
i couldn't stood it much longer .
then for an hour it was deadly dull , and i was fidgety .
miss watson would say , don't put your feet up there , huckleberry ; and don't scrunch up like that , huckleberryset up straight ; and pretty soon she would say , don't gap and stretch like that , huckleberrywhy don't you try to behave ?
then she told me all about the bad place , and i said i wished i was there .
she got mad then , but i didn't mean no harm .
all i wanted was to go somewheres ; all i wanted was a change , i warn't particular .
she said it was wicked to say what i said ; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place .
well , i couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going , so i made up my mind i wouldn't try for it .
but i never said so , because it would only make trouble , and wouldn't do no good .
now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .
she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever .
so i didn't think much of it .
but i never said so .
i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight .
i was glad about that , because i wanted him and me to be together .
miss watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome .
by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed .
i went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table .
then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it warn't no use .
i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead .
the stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and i heard an owl , away off , whowhooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and i couldn't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me .
then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood , and so can't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving .
i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had some company .
pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before i could budge it was all shriveled up .
i didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me .
i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away .
but i hadn't no confidence .
you do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but i hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider .
i set down again , ashaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow wouldn't know .
well , after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelve licks ; and all still againstiller than ever .
pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessomething was a stirring .
i set still and listened .
directly i could just barely hear a meyow !
meyow !
down there .
that was good !
says i , meyow !
meyow !
as soft as i could , and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed .
then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was tom sawyer waiting for me .
we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden , stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads .
when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise .
we scrouched down and laid still .
miss watson's big nigger , named jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him .
he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening .
then he says : who dah ?
he listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly .
well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound , and we all there so close together .
there was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but i dasn't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders .
seemed like i'd die if i couldn't scratch .
well , i've noticed that thing plenty times since .
if you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepyif you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch , why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places .
pretty soon jim says : say , who is you ?
whar is you ?
dog my cats ef i didn' hear sumf'n .
well , i know what i's gwyne to do : i's gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin .
so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom .
he leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine .
my nose begun to itch .
it itched till the tears come into my eyes .
but i dasn't scratch .
then it begun to itch on the inside .
next i got to itching underneath .
i didn't know how i was going to set still .
this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that .
i was itching in eleven different places now .
i reckoned i couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer , but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try .
just then jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again .
tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees .
when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me , and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun .
but i said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they'd find out i warn't in .
then tom said he hadn't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more .
i didn't want him to try .
i said jim might wake up and come .
but tom wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and tom laid five cents on the table for pay .
then we got out , and i was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him .
i waited , and it seemed a good while , everything was so still and lonesome .
as soon as tom was back we cut along the path , around the garden fence , and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house .
tom said he slipped jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him , and jim stirred a little , but he didn't wake .
afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance , and rode him all over the state , and then set him under the trees again , and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it .
and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans ; and , after that , every time he told it he spread it more and more , till by and by he said they rode him all over the world , and tired him most to death , and his back was all over saddleboils .
jim was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers .
niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country .
strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder .
niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , jim would happen in and say , hm !
what you know 'bout witches ?
and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat .
jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string , and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands , and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ; but he never told what it was he said to it .
niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had , just for a sight of that fivecenter piece ; but they wouldn't touch it , because the devil had had his hands on it .
jim was most ruined for a servant , because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches .
well , when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling , where there was sick folks , maybe ; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ; and down by the village was the river , a whole mile broad , and awful still and grand .
we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old tanyard .
so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore .
we went to a clump of bushes , and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes .
then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees .
we went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up .
tom poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole .
we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and sweaty and cold , and there we stopped .
tom says : now , we'll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer's gang .
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood .
everybody was willing .
so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it .
it swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band .
and nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed .
and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever .
everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked tom if he got it out of his own head .
he said , some of it , but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks , and every gang that was hightoned had it .
some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets .
tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in .
then ben rogers says : here's huck finn , he hain't got no family ; what you going to do 'bout him ?
well , hain't he got a father ?
says tom sawyer .
yes , he's got a father , but you can't never find him these days .
he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard , but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more .
they talked it over , and they was going to rule me out , because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill , or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others .
well , nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped , and set still .
i was most ready to cry ; but all at once i thought of a way , and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her .
everybody said : oh , she'll do .
that's all right .
huck can come in .
then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and i made my mark on the paper .
now , says ben rogers , what's the line of business of this gang ?
nothing only robbery and murder , tom said .
but who are we going to rob ?
houses ,or cattle , or stuff !
stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery ; it's burglary , says tom sawyer .
we ain't burglars .
that ain't no sort of style .
we are highwaymen .
we stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money .
must we always kill the people ?
oh , certainly .
it's best .
some authorities think different , but mostly it's considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they're ransomed .
ransomed ?
what's that ?
i don't know .
but that's what they do .
i've seen it in books ; and so of course that's what we've got to do .
but how can we do it if we don't know what it is ?
why , blame it all , we've got to do it .
don't i tell you it's in the books ?
do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books , and get things all muddled up ?
oh , that's all very fine to say , tom sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them ?
that'sthe thing i want to get at .
now , what do you reckon it is ?
well , i don't know .
but per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed , it means that we keep them till they're dead .
now , that's something like .
that'll answer .
why couldn't you said that before ?
we'll keep them till they're ransomed to death ; and a bothersome lot they'll be , tooeating up everything , and always trying to get loose .
how you talk , ben rogers .
how can they get loose when there's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ?
a guard !
well , that is good .
so somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them .
i think that's foolishness .
why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ?
because it ain't in the books sothat's why .
now , ben rogers , do you want to do things regular , or don't you ?
that'sthe idea .
don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do ?
do you reckon you can learn 'em anything ?
not by a good deal .
no , sir , we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way .
all right .
i don't mind ; but i say it's a fool way , anyhow .
say , do we kill the women , too ?
well , ben rogers , if i was as ignorant as you i wouldn't let on .
kill the women ?
no ; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that .
you fetch them to the cave , and you're always as polite as pie to them ; and by and by they fall in love with you , and never want to go home any more .
well , if that's the way i'm agreed , but i don't take no stock in it .
mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women , and fellows waiting to be ransomed , that there won't be no place for the robbers .
but go ahead , i ain't got nothing to say .
little tommy barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his ma , and didn't want to be a robber any more .
so they all made fun of him , and called him crybaby , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets .
but tom give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and rob somebody and kill some people .
ben rogers said he couldn't get out much , only sundays , and so he wanted to begin next sunday ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday , and that settled the thing .
they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang , and so started home .
i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking .
my new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and i was dogtired .
well , i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she didn't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could .
then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it .
she told me to pray every day , and whatever i asked for i would get it .
but it warn't so .
i tried it .
once i got a fishline , but no hooks .
it warn't any good to me without hooks .
i tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow i couldn't make it work .
by and by , one day , i asked miss watson to try for me , but she said i was a fool .
she never told me why , and i couldn't make it out no way .
i set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it .
i says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why don't deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork ?
why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ?
why can't miss watson fat up ?
no , says i to my self , there ain't nothing in it .
i went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts .
this was too many for me , but she told me what she meanti must help other people , and do everything i could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself .
this was including miss watson , as i took it .
i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but i couldn't see no advantage about itexcept for the other people ; so at last i reckoned i wouldn't worry about it any more , but just let it go .
sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water ; but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again .
i judged i could see that there was two providences , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence , but if miss watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more .
i thought it all out , and reckoned i would belong to the widow's if he wanted me , though i couldn't make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing i was so ignorant , and so kind of lowdown and ornery .
pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; i didn't want to see him no more .
he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around .
well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said .
they judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all .
they said he was floating on his back in the water .
they took him and buried him on the bank .
but i warn't comfortable long , because i happened to think of something .
i knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back , but on his face .
so i knowed , then , that this warn't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes .
so i was uncomfortable again .
i judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though i wished he wouldn't .
we played robber now and then about a month , and then i resigned .
all the boys did .
we hadn't robbed nobody , hadn't killed any people , but only just pretended .
we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them .
tom sawyer called the hogs ingots , and he called the turnips and stuff julery , and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
but i couldn't see no profit in it .
one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand sumter mules , all loaded down with di'monds , and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things .
he said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready .
he never could go after even a turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before .
i didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and arabs , but i wanted to see the camels and elephants , so i was on hand next day , saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
but there warn't no spaniards and arabs , and there warn't no camels nor no elephants .
it warn't anything but a sundayschool picnic , and only a primerclass at that .
we busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though ben rogers got a rag doll , and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut .
i didn't see no di'monds , and i told tom sawyer so .
he said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was arabs there , too , and elephants and things .
i said , why couldn't we see them , then ?
he said if i warn't so ignorant , but had read a book called don quixote , i would know without asking .
he said it was all done by enchantment .
he said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians ; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool , just out of spite .
i said , all right ; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians .
tom sawyer said i was a numskull .
why , said he , a magician could call up a lot of genies , and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson .
they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church .
well , i says , s'pose we got some genies to help uscan't we lick the other crowd then ?
how you going to get them ?
i don't know .
how do they get them ?
why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the genies come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke arolling , and everything they're told to do they up and do it .
they don't think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots , and belting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man .
who makes them tear around so ?
why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring .
they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they've got to do whatever he says .
if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds , and fill it full of chewinggum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor's daughter from china for you to marry , they've got to do itand they've got to do it before sunup next morning , too .
and more : they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand .
well , says i , i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that .
and what's moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp .
how you talk , huck finn .
why , you'd have to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not .
what !
and i as high as a tree and as big as a church ?
all right , then ; i would come ; but i lay i'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country .
shucks , it ain't no use to talk to you , huck finn .
you don't seem to know anything , somehowperfect saphead .
i thought all this over for two or three days , and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it .
i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it warn't no use , none of the genies come .
so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyer's lies .
i reckoned he believed in the arabs and the elephants , but as for me i think different .
it had all the marks of a sundayschool .
well , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now .
i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirtyfive , and i don't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever .
i don't take no stock in mathematics , anyway .
at first i hated the school , but by and by i got so i could stand it .
whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey , and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up .
so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be .
i was getting sort of used to the widow's ways , too , and they warn't so raspy on me .
living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me .
i liked the old ways best , but i was getting so i liked the new ones , too , a little bit .
the widow said i was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory .
she said she warn't ashamed of me .
one morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast .
i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but miss watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off .
she says , take your hands away , huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making !
the widow put in a good word for me , but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck , i knowed that well enough .
i started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be .
there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this wasn't one of them kind ; so i never tried to do anything , but just poked along lowspirited and on the watchout .
i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence .
there was an inch of new snow on the ground , and i seen somebody's tracks .
they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence .
it was funny they hadn't come in , after standing around so .
i couldn't make it out .
it was very curious , somehow .
i was going to follow around , but i stooped down to look at the tracks first .
i didn't notice anything at first , but next i did .
there was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails , to keep off the devil .
i was up in a second and shinning down the hill .
i looked over my shoulder every now and then , but i didn't see nobody .
i was at judge thatcher's as quick as i could get there .
he said : why , my boy , you are all out of breath .
did you come for your interest ?
no , sir , i says ; is there some for me ?
oh , yes , a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty dollars .
quite a fortune for you .
you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you'll spend it .
no , sir , i says , i don't want to spend it .
i don't want it at allnor the six thousand , nuther .
i want you to take it ; i want to give it to youthe six thousand and all .
he looked surprised .
he couldn't seem to make it out .
he says : why , what can you mean , my boy ?
i says , don't you ask me no questions about it , please .
you'll take itwon't you ?
he says : well , i'm puzzled .
is something the matter ?
please take it , says i , and don't ask me nothingthen i won't have to tell no lies .
he studied a while , and then he says : ohoo !
i think i see .
you want to sell all your property to menot give it .
that's the correct idea .
then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : there ; you see it says 'for a consideration .
'that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it .
here's a dollar for you .
now you sign it .
so i signed it , and left .
miss watson's nigger , jim , had a hairball as big as your fist , which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox , and he used to do magic with it .
he said there was a spirit inside of it , and it knowed everything .
so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for i found his tracks in the snow .
what i wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ?
jim got out his hairball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor .
it fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch .
jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same .
jim got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened .
but it warn't no use ; he said it wouldn't talk .
he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money .
i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it wouldn't pass nohow , even if the brass didn't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time .
i reckoned i wouldn't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge .
i said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the hairball would take it , because maybe it wouldn't know the difference .
jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good .
he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you couldn't see no brass , and it wouldn't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a hairball .
well , i knowed a potato would do that before , but i had forgot it .
jim put the quarter under the hairball , and got down and listened again .
this time he said the hairball was all right .
he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to .
i says , go on .
so the hairball talked to jim , and jim told it to me .
he says : yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's agwyne to do .
sometimes he spec he'll go 'way , en den agin he spec he'll stay .
de bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way .
dey's two angels hoverin' roun' 'bout him .
one uv 'em is white en shiny , en t'other one is black .
de white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up .
a body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las' .
but you is all right .
you gwyne to have considable trouble in yo' life , en considable joy .
sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you's gwyne to git well agin .
dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life .
one uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark .
one is rich en t'other is po' .
you's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by .
you wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin , en don't run no resk , 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung .
when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self !
i had shut the door to .
then i turned around and there he was .
i used to be scared of him all the time , he tanned me so much .
i reckoned i was scared now , too ; but in a minute i see i was mistakenthat is , after the first jolt , as you may say , when my breath sort of hitched , he being so unexpected ; but right away after i see i warn't scared of him worth bothring about .
he was most fifty , and he looked it .
his hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines .
it was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixedup whiskers .
there warn't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body's flesh crawla treetoad white , a fishbelly white .
as for his clothesjust rags , that was all .
he had one ankle resting on t'other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then .
his hat was laying on the flooran old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid .
i stood alooking at him ; he set there alooking at me , with his chair tilted back a little .
i set the candle down .
i noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed .
he kept alooking me all over .
by and by he says : starchy clothesvery .
you think you're a good deal of a bigbug , don't you ?
maybe i am , maybe i ain't , i says .
don't you give me none o' your lip , says he .
you've put on considerable many frills since i been away .
i'll take you down a peg before i get done with you .
you're educated , too , they saycan read and write .
you think you're better'n your father , now , don't you , because he can't ?
i'll take it out of you .
who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness , hey ?
whotold you you could ?
the widow .
she told me .
the widow , hey ?
andwho told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business ?
nobody never told her .
well , i'll learn her how to meddle .
and looky hereyou drop that school , you hear ?
i'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what he is .
you lemme catch you fooling around that school again , you hear ?
your mother couldn't read , and she couldn't write , nuther , before she died .
none of the family couldn't before they died .
i can't ; and here you're aswelling yourself up like this .
i ain't the man to stand ityou hear ?
say , lemme hear you read .
i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars .
when i'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house .
he says : it's so .
you can do it .
i had my doubts when you told me .
now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills .
i won't have it .
i'll lay for you , my smarty ; and if i catch you about that school i'll tan you good .
first you know you'll get religion , too .
i never see such a son .
he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : what's this ?
it's something they give me for learning my lessons good .
he tore it up , and says : i'll give you something betteri'll give you a cowhide .
he set there amumbling and agrowling a minute , and then he says : ain't you a sweetscented dandy , though ?
a bed ; and bedclothes ; and a look'n'glass ; and a piece of carpet on the floorand your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard .
i never see such a son .
i bet i'll take some o' these frills out o' you before i'm done with you .
why , there ain't no end to your airsthey say you're rich .
hey ?
how'sthat ?
they liethat's how .
looky heremind how you talk to me ; i'm astanding about all i can stand nowso don't gimme no sass .
i've been in town two days , and i hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich .
i heard about it away down the river , too .
that's why i come .
you git me that money tomorrowi want it .
i hain't got no money .
it's a lie .
judge thatcher's got it .
you git it .
i want it .
i hain't got no money , i tell you .
you ask judge thatcher ; he'll tell you the same .
all right .
i'll ask him ; and i'll make him pungle , too , or i'll know the reason why .
say , how much you got in your pocket ?
i want it .
i hain't got only a dollar , and i want that to it don't make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it out .
he took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ; said he hadn't had a drink all day .
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ; and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didn't drop that .
next day he was drunk , and he went to judge thatcher's and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he couldn't , and then he swore he'd make the law force him .
the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he didn't know the old man ; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he'd druther not take a child away from its father .
so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business .
that pleased the old man till he couldn't rest .
he said he'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didn't raise some money for him .
i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week .
but he said he was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he'd make it warm for him .
when he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him .
so he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak .
and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
the judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it .
the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again .
and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take ahold of it ; shake it .
there's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ain't so no more ; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life , and'll die before he'll go back .
you mark them wordsdon't forget i said them .
it's a clean hand now ; shake itdon't be afeard .
so they shook it , one after the other , all around , and cried .
the judge's wife she kissed it .
then the old man he signed a pledgemade his mark .
the judge said it was the holiest time on record , or something like that .
then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room , which was the spare room , and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod , and clumb back again and had a good old time ; and towards daylight he crawled out again , drunk as a fiddler , and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places , and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup .
and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it .
the judge he felt kind of sore .
he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he didn't know no other way .
well , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school .
he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but i went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time .
i didn't want to go to school much before , but i reckoned i'd go now to spite pap .
that law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then i'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding .
every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town ; and every time he raised cain he got jailed .
he was just suitedthis kind of thing was right in his line .
he got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him .
well , wasn't he mad ?
he said he would show who was huck finn's boss .
so he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was .
he kept me with him all the time , and i never got a chance to run off .
we lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights .
he had a gun which he had stole , i reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on .
every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me .
the widow she found out where i was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it warn't long after that till i was used to being where i was , and liked itall but the cowhide part .
it was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study .
two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and i didn't see how i'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time .
i didn't want to go back no more .
i had stopped cussing , because the widow didn't like it ; but now i took to it again because pap hadn't no objections .
it was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around .
but by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry , and i couldn't stand it .
i was all over welts .
he got to going away so much , too , and locking me in .
once he locked me in and was gone three days .
it was dreadful lonesome .
i judged he had got drownded , and i wasn't ever going to get out any more .
i was scared .
i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there .
i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but i couldn't find no way .
there warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through .
i couldn't get up the chimbly ; it was too narrow .
the door was thick , solid oak slabs .
pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , i was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time .
but this time i found something at last ; i found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle ; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof .
i greased it up and went to work .
there was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out .
i got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through .
well , it was a good long job , but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap's gun in the woods .
i got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in .
pap warn't in a good humorso he was his natural self .
he said he was down town , and everything was going wrong .
his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and judge thatcher knowed how to do it .
and he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time .
this shook me up considerable , because i didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it .
then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of , and so called them what'shisname when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing .
he said he would like to see the widow get me .
he said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me .
that made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; i reckoned i wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance .
the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got .
there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a fourgallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow .
i toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
i thought it all over , and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when i run away .
i guessed i wouldn't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more .
i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and i reckoned he would .
i got so full of it i didn't notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded .
i got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark .
while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again .
he had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at .
a body would a thought he was adamhe was just all mud .
whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment , this time he says : call this a govment !
why , just look at it and see what it's like .
here's the law astanding ready to take a man's son away from hima man's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising .
yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for him and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him .
and they call that govment !
that ain't all , nuther .
the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property .
here's what the law does : the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards , and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this , and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog .
they call that govment !
a man can't get his rights in a govment like this .
sometimes i've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all .
yes , and i told 'em so ; i told old thatcher so to his face .
lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what i said .
says i , for two cents i'd leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin .
them's the very words .
i says look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin , and then it ain't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stovepipe .
look at it , says isuch a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights .
oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful .
why , looky here .
there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter , most as white as a white man .
he had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state .
and what do you think ?
they said he was a p'fessor in a college , and could talk all kinds of languages , and knowed everything .
and that ain't the wust .
they said he could vote when he was at home .
well , that let me out .
thinks i , what is the country acoming to ?
it was 'lection day , and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warn't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote , i drawed out .
i says i'll never vote agin .
them's the very words i said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all mei'll never vote agin as long as i live .
and to see the cool way of that niggerwhy , he wouldn't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o' the way .
i says to the people , why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold ?
that'swhat i want to know .
and what do you reckon they said ?
why , they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months , and he hadn't been there that long yet .
there , nowthat's a specimen .
they call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months .
here's a govment that calls itself a govment , and lets on to be a govment , and thinks it is a govment , and yet's got to set stockstill for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , thieving , infernal , whiteshirted free nigger , and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there .
he hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one shin and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick .
but it warn't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous .
he said so his own self afterwards .
he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but i reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe .
after supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens .
that was always his word .
i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then i would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t'other .
he drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck didn't run my way .
he didn't go sound asleep , but was uneasy .
he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time .
at last i got so sleepy i couldn't keep my eyes open all i could do , and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep , and the candle burning .
i don't know how long i was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up .
there was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes .
he said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldn't see no snakes .
he started and run round and round the cabin , hollering take him off !
take him off !
he's biting me on the neck !
i never see a man look so wild in the eyes .
pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting ; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils ahold of him .
he wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning .
then he laid stiller , and didn't make a sound .
i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still .
he was laying over by the corner .
by and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side .
he says , very low : tramptramptramp ; that's the dead ; tramptramptramp ; they're coming after me ; but i won't go .
oh , they're here !
don't touch medon't !
hands offthey're cold ; let go .
oh , let a poor devil alone !
then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still abegging ; and then he went to crying .
i could hear him through the blanket .
by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me .
he chased me round and round the place with a claspknife , calling me the angel of death , and saying he would kill me , and then i couldn't come for him no more .
i begged , and told him i was only huck ; but he laughed such a screechy laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up .
once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and i thought i was gone ; but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself .
pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me .
he put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who .
so he dozed off pretty soon .
by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun .
i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then i laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir .
and how slow and still the time did drag along .
git up !
what you 'bout ?
i opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where i was .
it was after sunup , and i had been sound asleep .
pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too .
he says : what you doin' with this gun ?
i judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing , so i says : somebody tried to get in , so i was laying for him .
why didn't you roust me out ?
well , i tried to , but i couldn't ; i couldn't budge you .
well , all right .
don't stand there palavering all day , but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast .
i'll be along in a minute .
he unlocked the door , and i cleared out up the riverbank .
i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so i knowed the river had begun to rise .
i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town .
the june rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down , and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill .
i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along .
well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck .
i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe .
i just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him .
but it warn't so this time .
it was a driftcanoe sure enough , and i clumb in and paddled her ashore .
thinks i , the old man will be glad when he sees thisshe's worth ten dollars .
but when i got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet , and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully , all hung over with vines and willows , i struck another idea : i judged i'd hide her good , and then , 'stead of taking to the woods when i run off , i'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot .
it was pretty close to the shanty , and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time ; but i got her hid ; and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun .
so he hadn't seen anything .
when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line .
he abused me a little for being so slow ; but i told him i fell in the river , and that was what made me so long .
i knowed he would see i was wet , and then he would be asking questions .
we got five catfish off the lines and went home .
while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up , both of us being about wore out , i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me , it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ; you see , all kinds of things might happen .
well , i didn't see no way for a while , but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water , and he says : another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out , you hear ?
that man warn't here for no good .
i'd a shot him .
next time you roust me out , you hear ?
then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted .
i says to myself , i can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me .
about twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank .
the river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise .
by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together .
we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore .
then we had dinner .
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that warn't pap's style .
nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell .
so he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about halfpast three .
i judged he wouldn't come back that night .
i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start ; then i out with my saw , and went to work on that log again .
before he was t'other side of the river i was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder .
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then i done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whiskyjug .
i took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; i took the wadding ; i took the bucket and gourd ; i took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffeepot .
i took fishlines and matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent .
i cleaned out the place .
i wanted an axe , but there wasn't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and i knowed why i was going to leave that .
i fetched out the gun , and now i was done .
i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things .
so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust .
then i fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground .
if you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed , you wouldn't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there .
it was all grass clear to the canoe , so i hadn't left a track .
i followed around to see .
i stood on the bank and looked out over the river .
all safe .
so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
i shot this fellow and took him into camp .
i took the axe and smashed in the door .
i beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it .
i fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; i say ground because it was groundhard packed , and no boards .
well , next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in itall i could dragand i started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight .
you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground .
i did wish tom sawyer was there ; i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches .
nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that .
well , last i pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner .
then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldn't drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
now i thought of something else .
so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house .
i took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there warn't no knives and forks on the placepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking .
then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too , you might say , in the season .
there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , i don't know where , but it didn't go to the river .
the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake .
i dropped pap's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident .
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it wouldn't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again .
it was about dark now ; so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise .
i made fast to a willow ; then i took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
i says to myself , they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me .
and they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things .
they won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass .
they'll soon get tired of that , and won't bother no more about me .
all right ; i can stop anywhere i want to .
jackson's island is good enough for me ; i know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there .
and then i can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things i want .
jackson's island's the place .
i was pretty tired , and the first thing i knowed i was asleep .
when i woke up i didn't know where i was for a minute .
i set up and looked around , a little scared .
then i remembered .
the river looked miles and miles across .
the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went aslipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore .
everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and smelt late .
you know what i meani don't know the words to put it in .
i took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water .
i listened .
pretty soon i made it out .
it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night .
i peeped out through the willow branches , and there it wasa skiff , away across the water .
i couldn't tell how many was in it .
it kept acoming , and when it was abreast of me i see there warn't but one man in it .
think's i , maybe it's pap , though i warn't expecting him .
he dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him .
well , it was pap , sure enoughand sober , too , by the way he laid his oars .
i didn't lose no time .
the next minute i was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank .
i made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me .
i got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float .
i laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it .
the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; i never knowed it before .
and how far a body can hear on the water such nights !
i heard people talking at the ferry landing .
i heard what they said , tooevery word of it .
one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now .
t'other one said this warn't one of the short ones , he reckonedand then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he didn't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone .
the first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good ; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time .
i heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer .
after that the talk got further and further away , and i couldn't make out the words any more ; but i could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off .
i was away below the ferry now .
i rose up , and there was jackson's island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights .
there warn't any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now .
it didn't take me long to get there .
i shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore .
i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about ; i had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside .
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling .
a monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it .
i watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say , stern oars , there !
heave her head to stabboard !
i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side .
there was a little gray in the sky now ; so i stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast .
the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o'clock .
i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied .
i could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them .
there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there .
a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly .
i was powerful lazy and comfortabledidn't want to get up and cook breakfast .
well , i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom !
away up the river .
i rouses up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon i hears it again .
i hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry .
and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down .
i knowed what was the matter now .
boom !
i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side .
you see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top .
i was pretty hungry , but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke .
so i set there and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom .
the river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat .
well , then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there .
so , says i , i'll keep a lookout , and if any of them's floating around after me i'll give them a show .
i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have , and i warn't disappointed .
a big double loaf come along , and i most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further .
of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei knowed enough for that .
but by and by along comes another one , and this time i won .
i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in .
it was baker's breadwhat the quality eat ; none of your lowdown cornpone .
i got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferryboat , and very well satisfied .
and then something struck me .
i says , now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it .
so there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thingthat is , there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it don't work for me , and i reckon it don't work for only just the right kind .
i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching .
the ferryboat was floating with the current , and i allowed i'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did .
when she'd got pretty well along down towards me , i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
where the log forked i could peep through .
by and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore .
most everybody was on the boat .
pap , and judge thatcher , and bessie thatcher , and jo harper , and tom sawyer , and his old aunt polly , and sid and mary , and plenty more .
everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge .
i hope so , anyway .
i didn't hope so .
they all crowded up and leaned over the rails , nearly in my face , and kept still , watching with all their might .
i could see them firstrate , but they couldn't see me .
then the captain sung out : stand away !
and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke , and i judged i was gone .
if they'd a had some bullets in , i reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after .
well , i see i warn't hurt , thanks to goodness .
the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island .
i could hear the booming now and then , further and further off , and by and by , after an hour , i didn't hear it no more .
the island was three mile long .
i judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up .
but they didn't yet a while .
they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went .
i crossed over to that side and watched them .
when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town .
i knowed i was all right now .
nobody else would come ahunting after me .
i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods .
i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them .
i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper .
then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast .
when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you can't stay so , you soon get over it .
and so for three days and nights .
no differencejust the same thing .
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island .
i was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and i wanted to know all about it ; but mainly i wanted to put in the time .
i found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green razberries ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show .
they would all come handy by and by , i judged .
well , i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warn't far from the foot of the island .
i had my gun along , but i hadn't shot nothing ; it was for protection ; thought i would kill some game nigh home .
about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and i after it , trying to get a shot at it .
i clipped along , and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking .
my heart jumped up amongst my lungs .
i never waited for to look further , but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could .
every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard i couldn't hear nothing else .
i slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on .
if i see a stump , i took it for a man ; if i trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half , and the short half , too .
when i got to camp i warn't feeling very brash , there warn't much sand in my craw ; but i says , this ain't no time to be fooling around .
so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year's camp , and then clumb a tree .
i reckon i was up in the tree two hours ; but i didn't see nothing , i didn't hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things .
well , i couldn't stay up there forever ; so at last i got down , but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time .
all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast .
by the time it was night i was pretty hungry .
so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile .
i went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk , plunketyplunk , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next i hear people's voices .
i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out .
i hadn't got far when i hear a man say : we better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out .
let's look around .
i didn't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
i tied up in the old place , and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe .
i didn't sleep much .
i couldn't , somehow , for thinking .
and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck .
so the sleep didn't do me no good .
by and by i says to myself , i can't live this way ; i'm agoing to find out who it is that's here on the island with me ; i'll find it out or bust .
well , i felt better right off .
so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows .
the moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day .
i poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep .
well , by this time i was most down to the foot of the island .
a little ripply , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done .
i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods .
i sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves .
i see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river .
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops , and knowed the day was coming .
so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen .
but i hadn't no luck somehow ; i couldn't seem to find the place .
but by and by , sure enough , i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees .
i went for it , cautious and slow .
by and by i was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground .
it most give me the fantods .
he had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire .
i set there behind a clump of bushes , in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady .
it was getting gray daylight now .
pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was miss watson's jim !
i bet i was glad to see him .
i says : hello , jim !
and skipped out .
he bounced up and stared at me wild .
then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : doan' hurt medon't !
i hain't ever done no harm to a ghos' .
i alwuz liked dead people , en done all i could for 'em .
you go en git in de river agin , whah you b'longs , en doan' do nuffn to ole jim , 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren' .
well , i warn't long making him understand i warn't dead .
i was ever so glad to see jim .
i warn't lonesome now .
i told him i warn't afraid of him telling the people where i was .
i talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing .
then i says : it's good daylight .
le's get breakfast .
make up your camp fire good .
what's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck ?
but you got a gun , hain't you ?
den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries .
strawberries and such truck , i says .
is that what you live on ?
i couldn' git nuffn else , he says .
why , how long you been on the island , jim ?
i come heah de night arter you's killed .
what , all that time ?
yesindeedy .
and ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat ?
no , sahnuffn else .
well , you must be most starved , ain't you ?
i reck'n i could eat a hoss .
i think i could .
how long you ben on de islan' ?
since the night i got killed .
no !
w'y , what has you lived on ?
but you got a gun .
oh , yes , you got a gun .
dat's good .
now you kill sumfn en i'll make up de fire .
so we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , i fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and coffeepot and fryingpan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft .
i catched a good big catfish , too , and jim cleaned him with his knife , and fried him .
when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot .
jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved .
then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied .
by and by jim says : but looky here , huck , who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you ?
then i told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart .
he said tom sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what i had .
then i says : how do you come to be here , jim , and how'd you get here ?
he looked pretty uneasy , and didn't say nothing for a minute .
then he says : maybe i better not tell .
why , jim ?
well , dey's reasons .
but you wouldn' tell on me ef i uz to tell you , would you , huck ?
blamed if i would , jim .
well , i b'lieve you , huck .
ii run off .
jim !
but mind , you said you wouldn' tellyou know you said you wouldn' tell , huck .
well , i did .
i said i wouldn't , and i'll stick to it .
honest injun , i will .
people would call me a lowdown abolitionist and despise me for keeping mumbut that don't make no difference .
i ain't agoing to tell , and i ain't agoing back there , anyways .
so , now , le's know all about it .
well , you see , it 'uz dis way .
ole missusdat's miss watsonshe pecks on me all de time , en treats me pooty rough , but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to orleans .
but i noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately , en i begin to git oneasy .
well , one night i creeps to de do' pooty late , en de do' warn't quite shet , en i hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to orleans , but she didn' want to , but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me , en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis' .
de widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do it , but i never waited to hear de res' .
i lit out mighty quick , i tell you .
i tuck out en shin down de hill , en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town , but dey wuz people astirring yit , so i hid in de ole tumbledown coopershop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way .
well , i wuz dah all night .
dey wuz somebody roun' all de time .
'long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by , en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed .
dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen agoin' over for to see de place .
sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost , so by de talk i got to know all 'bout de killin' .
i 'uz powerful sorry you's killed , huck , but i ain't no mo' now .
i laid dah under de shavin's all day .
i 'uz hungry , but i warn't afeard ; bekase i knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de campmeet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day , en dey knows i goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight , so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place , en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin' .
de yuther servants wouldn' miss me , kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way .
well , when it come dark i tuck out up de river road , en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses .
i'd made up my mine 'bout what i's agwyne to do .
you see , ef i kep' on tryin' to git away afoot , de dogs 'ud track me ; ef i stole a skift to cross over , dey'd miss dat skift , you see , en dey'd know 'bout whah i'd lan' on de yuther side , en whah to pick up my track .
so i says , a raff is what i's arter ; it doan' make no track .
i see a light acomin' roun' de p'int bymeby , so i wade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river , en got in 'mongst de driftwood , en kep' my head down low , en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along .
den i swum to de stern uv it en tuck aholt .
it clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while .
so i clumb up en laid down on de planks .
de men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle , whah de lantern wuz .
de river wuz arisin' , en dey wuz a good current ; so i reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' i'd be twentyfive mile down de river , en den i'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho' , en take to de woods on de illinois side .
but i didn' have no luck .
when we 'uz mos' down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern , i see it warn't no use fer to wait , so i slid overboard en struck out fer de islan' .
well , i had a notion i could lan' mos' anywhers , but i couldn'tbank too bluff .
i 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' i found' a good place .
i went into de woods en jedged i wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo' , long as dey move de lantern roun' so .
i had my pipe en a plug er dogleg , en some matches in my cap , en dey warn't wet , so i 'uz all right .
and so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ?
why didn't you get mudturkles ?
how you gwyne to git 'm ?
you can't slip up on um en grab um ; en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ?
how could a body do it in de night ?
en i warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime .
well , that's so .
you've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course .
did you hear 'em shooting the cannon ?
oh , yes .
i knowed dey was arter you .
i see um go by heahwatched um thoo de bushes .
some young birds come along , flying a yard or two at a time and lighting .
jim said it was a sign it was going to rain .
he said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it .
i was going to catch some of them , but jim wouldn't let me .
he said it was death .
he said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old granny said his father would die , and he did .
and jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck .
the same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown .
and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die .
jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots ; but i didn't believe that , because i had tried them lots of times myself , and they wouldn't sting me .
i had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them .
jim knowed all kinds of signs .
he said he knowed most everything .
i said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so i asked him if there warn't any goodluck signs .
he says : mighty fewan' dey ain't no use to a body .
what you want to know when good luck's acomin' for ?
want to keep it off ?
and he said : ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas' , it's a sign dat you's agwyne to be rich .
well , dey's some use in a sign like dat , 'kase it's so fur ahead .
you see , maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust , en so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby .
have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast , jim ?
what's de use to ax dat question ?
don't you see i has ?
well , are you rich ?
no , but i ben rich wunst , and gwyne to be rich agin .
wunst i had foteen dollars , but i tuck to specalat'n' , en got busted out .
what did you speculate in , jim ?
well , fust i tackled stock .
what kind of stock ?
why , live stockcattle , you know .
i put ten dollars in a cow .
but i ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock .
de cow up 'n' died on my han's .
so you lost the ten dollars .
no , i didn't lose it all .
i on'y los' 'bout nine of it .
i sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents .
you had five dollars and ten cents left .
did you speculate any more ?
yes .

well , he sot up a bank , en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year .
well , all de niggers went in , but dey didn't have much .
i wuz de on'y one dat had much .
so i stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars , en i said 'f i didn' git it i'd start a bank mysef .
well , o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business , bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks , so he say i could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirtyfive at de en' er de year .
so i done it .
den i reck'n'd i'd inves' de thirtyfive dollars right off en keep things amovin' .
dey wuz a nigger name' bob , dat had ketched a woodflat , en his marster didn' know it ; en i bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirtyfive dollars when de en' er de year come ; but somebody stole de woodflat dat night , en nex day de onelaigged nigger say de bank's busted .
so dey didn' none uv us git no money .
what did you do with the ten cents , jim ?
well , i 'uz gwyne to spen' it , but i had a dream , en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name' balumbalum's ass dey call him for short ; he's one er dem chuckleheads , you know .

de dream say let balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me .
well , balum he tuck de money , en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de lord , en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times .
so balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po' , en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it .
well , what did come of it , jim ?
nuffn never come of it .
i couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way ; en balum he couldn' .
i ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout i see de security .
boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times , de preacher says !
ef i could git de ten cents back , i'd call it squah , en be glad er de chanst .
well , it's all right anyway , jim , long as you're going to be rich again some time or other .
yes ; en i's rich now , come to look at it .
i owns mysef , en i's wuth eight hund'd dollars .
i wisht i had de money , i wouldn' want no mo' .
i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that i'd found when i was exploring ; so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide .
this place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high .
we had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick .
we tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards illinois .
the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and jim could stand up straight in it .
it was cool in there .
jim was for putting our traps in there right away , but i said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time .
jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place , and had all the traps in the cavern , we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island , and they would never find us without dogs .
and , besides , he said them little birds had said it was going to rain , and did i want the things to get wet ?
so we went back and got the canoe , and paddled up abreast the cavern , and lugged all the traps up there .
then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in , amongst the thick willows .
we took some fish off of the lines and set them again , and begun to get ready for dinner .
the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in , and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit , and was flat and a good place to build a fire on .
so we built it there and cooked dinner .
we spread the blankets inside for a carpet , and eat our dinner in there .
we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern .
pretty soon it darkened up , and begun to thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it .
directly it begun to rain , and it rained like all fury , too , and i never see the wind blow so .
it was one of these regular summer storms .
it would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside , and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby ; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves ; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ; and next , when it was just about the bluest and blackestfst !
it was as bright as glory , and you'd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the storm , hundreds of yards further than you could see before ; dark as sin again in a second , and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash , and then go rumbling , grumbling , tumbling , down the sky towards the under side of the world , like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal , you know .
jim , this is nice , i says .
i wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here .
pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread .
well , you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for jim .
you'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en gittn' mos' drownded , too ; dat you would , honey .
chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile .
the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks .
the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom .
on that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the missouri side it was the same old distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs .
daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe , it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside .
we went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way .
well , on every old brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtlesthey would slide off in the water .
the ridge our cavern was in was full of them .
we could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them .
one night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks .
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid , level floor .
we could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we didn't show ourselves in daylight .
another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a framehouse down , on the west side .
she was a twostory , and tilted over considerable .
we paddled out and got aboardclumb in at an upstairs window .
but it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight .
the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island .
then we looked in at the window .
we could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall .
there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man .
so jim says : hello , you !
but it didn't budge .
so i hollered again , and then jim says : de man ain't asleephe's dead .
you hold stilli'll go en see .
he went , and bent down and looked , and says : it's a dead man .
yes , indeedy ; naked , too .
he's ben shot in de back .
i reck'n he's ben dead two er three days .
come in , huck , but doan' look at his faceit's too gashly .
i didn't look at him at all .
jim throwed some old rags over him , but he needn't done it ; i didn't want to see him .
there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal .
there was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sunbonnet , and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men's clothing , too .
we put the lot into the canoeit might come good .
there was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor ; i took that , too .
and there was a bottle that had had milk in it , and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck .
we would a took the bottle , but it was broke .
there was a seedy old chest , and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke .
they stood open , but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account .
the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry , and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff .
we got an old tin lantern , and a butcherknife without any handle , and a brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store , and a lot of tallow candles , and a tin candlestick , and a gourd , and a tin cup , and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed , and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it , and a hatchet and some nails , and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it , and a roll of buckskin , and a leather dogcollar , and a horseshoe , and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them ; and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomb , and jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow , and a wooden leg .
the straps was broke off of it , but , barring that , it was a good enough leg , though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim , and we couldn't find the other one , though we hunted all around .
and so , take it all around , we made a good haul .
when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island , and it was pretty broad day ; so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt , because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off .
i paddled over to the illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it .
i crept up the dead water under the bank , and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody .
we got home all safe .
after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but jim didn't want to .
he said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha'nt us ; he said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go aha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable .
that sounded pretty reasonable , so i didn't say no more ; but i couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for .
we rummaged the clothes we'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat .
jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it .
i said i reckoned they killed him , too ; but jim didn't want to talk about that .
i says : now you think it's bad luck ; but what did you say when i fetched in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ?
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands .
well , here's your bad luck !
we've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides .
i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , jim .
never you mind , honey , never you mind .
don't you git too peart .
it's acomin' .
mind i tell you , it's acomin' .
it did come , too .
it was a tuesday that we had that talk .
well , after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco .
i went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there .
i killed him , and curled him up on the foot of jim's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there'd be some fun when jim found him there .
well , by night i forgot all about the snake , and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake's mate was there , and bit him .
he jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring .
i laid him out in a second with a stick , and jim grabbed pap's whiskyjug and begun to pour it down .
he was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel .
that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it .
jim told me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it .
i done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him .
he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too .
he said that that would help .
then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for i warn't going to let jim find out it was all my fault , not if i could help it .
jim sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again .
his foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so i judged he was all right ; but i'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky .
jim was laid up for four days and nights .
then the swelling was all gone and he was around again .
i made up my mind i wouldn't ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands , now that i see what had come of it .
jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time .
and he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet .
he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand .
well , i was getting to feel that way myself , though i've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do .
old hank bunker done it once , and bragged about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but i didn't see it .
pap told me .
but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool .
well , the days went along , and the river went down between its banks again ; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man , being six foot two inches long , and weighed over two hundred pounds .
we couldn't handle him , of course ; he would a flung us into illinois .
we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded .
we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball , and lots of rubbage .
we split the ball open with the hatchet , and there was a spool in it .
jim said he'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it .
it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi , i reckon .
jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one .
he would a been worth a good deal over at the village .
they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry .
next morning i said it was getting slow and dull , and i wanted to get a stirring up some way .
i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on .
jim liked that notion ; but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp .
then he studied it over and said , couldn't i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl ?
that was a good notion , too .
so we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it .
jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit .
i put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe .
jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly .
i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by i could do pretty well in them , only jim said i didn't walk like a girl ; and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket .
i took notice , and done better .
i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark .
i started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town .
i tied up and started along the bank .
there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time , and i wondered who had took up quarters there .
i slipped up and peeped in at the window .
there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table .
i didn't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you couldn't start a face in that town that i didn't know .
now this was lucky , because i was weakening ; i was getting afraid i had come ; people might know my voice and find me out .
but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know ; so i knocked at the door , and made up my mind i wouldn't forget i was a girl .
come in , says the woman , and i did .
she says : take a cheer .
i done it .
she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : what might your name be ?
sarah williams .
where 'bouts do you live ?
in this neighborhood ?
'no'm .
in hookerville , seven mile below .
i've walked all the way and i'm all tired out .
hungry , too , i reckon .
i'll find you something .
no'm , i ain't hungry .
i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm ; so i ain't hungry no more .
it's what makes me so late .
my mother's down sick , and out of money and everything , and i come to tell my uncle abner moore .
he lives at the upper end of the town , she says .
i hain't ever been here before .
do you know him ?
no ; but i don't know everybody yet .
i haven't lived here quite two weeks .
it's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town .
you better stay here all night .
take off your bonnet .
no , i says ; i'll rest a while , i reckon , and go on .
i ain't afeared of the dark .
she said she wouldn't let me go by myself , but her husband would be in by and by , maybe in a hour and a half , and she'd send him along with me .
then she got to talking about her husband , and about her relations up the river , and her relations down the river , and about how much better off they used to was , and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town , instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on , till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder , and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along .
she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was , and what a hard lot i was , and at last she got down to where i was murdered .
i says : who done it ?
we've heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville , but we don't know who 'twas that killed huck finn .
well , i reckon there's a right smart chance of people here that'd like to know who killed him .
some think old finn done it himself .
nois that so ?
most everybody thought it at first .
he'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched .
but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim .
why he i stopped .
i reckoned i better keep still .
she run on , and never noticed i had put in at all : the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed .
so there's a reward out for himthree hundred dollars .
and there's a reward out for old finn , tootwo hundred dollars .
you see , he come to town the morning after the murder , and told about it , and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt , and right away after he up and left .
before night they wanted to lynch him , but he was gone , you see .
well , next day they found out the nigger was gone ; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done .
so then they put it on him , you see ; and while they was full of it , next day , back comes old finn , and went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with .
the judge gave him some , and that evening he got drunk , and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hardlooking strangers , and then went off with them .
well , he hain't come back sence , and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little , for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it , and then he'd get huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit .
people do say he warn't any too good to do it .
oh , he's sly , i reckon .
if he don't come back for a year he'll be all right .
you can't prove anything on him , you know ; everything will be quieted down then , and he'll walk in huck's money as easy as nothing .
yes , i reckon so , 'm .
i don't see nothing in the way of it .
has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it ?
oh , no , not everybody .
a good many thinks he done it .
but they'll get the nigger pretty soon now , and maybe they can scare it out of him .
why , are they after him yet ?
well , you're innocent , ain't you !
does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ?
some folks think the nigger ain't far from here .
i'm one of thembut i hain't talked it around .
a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jackson's island .
don't anybody live there ?
says i .
no , nobody , says they .
i didn't say any more , but i done some thinking .
i was pretty near certain i'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so i says to myself , like as not that nigger's hiding over there ; anyway , says i , it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt .
i hain't seen any smoke sence , so i reckon maybe he's gone , if it was him ; but husband's going over to seehim and another man .
he was gone up the river ; but he got back today , and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago .
i had got so uneasy i couldn't set still .
i had to do something with my hands ; so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it .
my hands shook , and i was making a bad job of it .
when the woman stopped talking i looked up , and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little .
i put down the needle and thread , and let on to be interestedand i was , tooand says : three hundred dollars is a power of money .
i wish my mother could get it .
is your husband going over there tonight ?
oh , yes .
he went uptown with the man i was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun .
they'll go over after midnight .
couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime ?
yes .
and couldn't the nigger see better , too ?
after midnight he'll likely be asleep , and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark , if he's got one .
i didn't think of that .
the woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and i didn't feel a bit comfortable .
pretty soon she says , what did you say your name was , honey ?
mmary williams .
somehow it didn't seem to me that i said it was mary before , so i didn't look upseemed to me i said it was sarah ; so i felt sort of cornered , and was afeared maybe i was looking it , too .
i wished the woman would say something more ; the longer she set still the uneasier i was .
but now she says : honey , i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in ?
oh , yes'm , i did .
sarah mary williams .
sarah's my first name .
some calls me sarah , some calls me mary .
oh , that's the way of it ?
yes'm .
i was feeling better then , but i wished i was out of there , anyway .
i couldn't look up yet .
well , the woman fell to talking about how hard times was , and how poor they had to live , and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place , and so forth and so on , and then i got easy again .
she was right about the rats .
you'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while .
she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone , or they wouldn't give her no peace .
she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot , and said she was a good shot with it generly , but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago , and didn't know whether she could throw true now .
but she watched for a chance , and directly banged away at a rat ; but she missed him wide , and said ouch !
it hurt her arm so .
then she told me to try for the next one .
i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back , but of course i didn't let on .
i got the thing , and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive , and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat .
she said that was firstrate , and she reckoned i would hive the next one .
she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back , and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with .
i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them , and went on talking about her and her husband's matters .
but she broke off to say : keep your eye on the rats .
you better have the lead in your lap , handy .
so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment , and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking .
but only about a minute .
then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face , and very pleasant , and says : come , now , what's your real name ?
whwhat , mum ?
what's your real name ?
is it bill , or tom , or bob ?
orwhat is it ?
i reckon i shook like a leaf , and i didn't know hardly what to do .
but i says : please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me , mum .
if i'm in the way here , i'll no , you won't .
set down and stay where you are .
i ain't going to hurt you , and i ain't going to tell on you , nuther .
you just tell me your secret , and trust me .
i'll keep it ; and , what's more , i'll help you .
so'll my old man if you want him to .
you see , you're a runaway 'prentice , that's all .
it ain't anything .
there ain't no harm in it .
you've been treated bad , and you made up your mind to cut .
bless you , child , i wouldn't tell on you .
tell me all about it now , that's a good boy .
so i said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer , and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything , but she musn't go back on her promise .
then i told her my father and mother was dead , and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river , and he treated me so bad i couldn't stand it no longer ; he went away to be gone a couple of days , and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out , and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles .
i traveled nights , and hid daytimes and slept , and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way , and i had aplenty .
i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me , and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen .
goshen , child ?
this ain't goshen .
this is st .
petersburg .
goshen's ten mile further up the river .
who told you this was goshen ?
why , a man i met at daybreak this morning , just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep .
he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to goshen .
he was drunk , i reckon .
he told you just exactly wrong .
well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ain't no matter now .
i got to be moving along .
i'll fetch goshen before daylight .
hold on a minute .
i'll put you up a snack to eat .
you might want it .
so she put me up a snack , and says : say , when a cow's laying down , which end of her gets up first ?
answer up prompt nowdon't stop to study over it .
which end gets up first ?
the hind end , mum .
well , then , a horse ?
the for'rard end , mum .
which side of a tree does the moss grow on ?
north side .
if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction ?
the whole fifteen , mum .
well , i reckon you have lived in the country .
i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again .
what's your real name , now ?
george peters , mum .
well , try to remember it , george .
don't forget and tell me it's elexander before you go , and then get out by saying it's george elexander when i catch you .
and don't go about women in that old calico .
you do a girl tolerable poor , but you might fool men , maybe .
bless you , child , when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ; that's the way a woman most always does , but a man always does t'other way .
and when you throw at a rat or anything , hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can , and miss your rat about six or seven foot .
throw stiffarmed from the shoulder , like there was a pivot there for it to turn on , like a girl ; not from the wrist and elbow , with your arm out to one side , like a boy .
and , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she don't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead .
why , i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and i contrived the other things just to make certain .
now trot along to your uncle , sarah mary williams george elexander peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs. judith loftus , which is me , and i'll do what i can to get you out of it .
keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you .
the river road's a rocky one , and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to goshen , i reckon .
i went up the bank about fifty yards , and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house .
i jumped in , and was off in a hurry .
i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across .
i took off the sunbonnet , for i didn't want no blinders on then .
when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike , so i stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven .
when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow , though i was most winded , but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot .
then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as i could go .
i landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern .
there jim laid , sound asleep on the ground .
i roused him out and says : git up and hump yourself , jim !
there ain't a minute to lose .
they're after us !
jim never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared .
by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid .
we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and didn't show a candle outside after that .
i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around i couldn't see it , for stars and shadows ain't good to see by .
then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word .
it must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow .
if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore ; and it was well a boat didn't come , for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a fishingline , or anything to eat .
we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things .
it warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft .
if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built , and watched it all night for jim to come .
anyways , they stayed away from us , and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine .
i played it as low down on them as i could .
when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there .
a towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth .
we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side , and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place , so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us .
we laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore , and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle .
i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman ; and jim said she was a smart one , and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fireno , sir , she'd fetch a dog .
well , then , i said , why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog ?
jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start , and he believed they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time , or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno , indeedy , we would be in that same old town again .
so i said i didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't .
when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket , and looked up and down and across ; nothing in sight ; so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy , and to keep the things dry .
jim made a floor for the wigwam , and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft , so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves .
right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly ; the wigwam would keep it from being seen .
we made an extra steeringoar , too , because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something .
we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on , because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream , to keep from getting run over ; but we wouldn't have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing ; for the river was pretty high yet , very low banks being still a little under water ; so upbound boats didn't always run the channel , but hunted easy water .
this second night we run between seven and eight hours , with a current that was making over four mile an hour .
we catched fish and talked , and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness .
it was kind of solemn , drifting down the big , still river , laying on our backs looking up at the stars , and we didn't ever feel like talking loud , and it warn't often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle .
we had mighty good weather as a general thing , and nothing ever happened to us at allthat night , nor the next , nor the next .
every night we passed towns , some of them away up on black hillsides , nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ; not a house could you see .
the fifth night we passed st .
louis , and it was like the whole world lit up .
in st .
petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st .
louis , but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night .
there warn't a sound there ; everybody was asleep .
every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village , and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ; and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable , and took him along .
pap always said , take a chicken when you get a chance , because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does , and a good deed ain't ever forgot .
i never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself , but that is what he used to say , anyway .
mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon , or a mushmelon , or a punkin , or some new corn , or things of that kind .
pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing , and no decent body would do it .
jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others .
so we talked it over all one night , drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons , or the cantelopes , or the mushmelons , or what .
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory , and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons .
we warn't feeling just right before that , but it was all comfortable now .
i was glad the way it come out , too , because crabapples ain't ever good , and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet .
we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening .
take it all round , we lived pretty high .
the fifth night below st .
louis we had a big storm after midnight , with a power of thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in a solid sheet .
we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself .
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead , and high , rocky bluffs on both sides .
by and by says i , hello , jim , looky yonder !
it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock .
we was drifting straight down for her .
the lightning showed her very distinct .
she was leaning over , with part of her upper deck above water , and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear , and a chair by the big bell , with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it , when the flashes come .
well , it being away in the night and stormy , and all so mysteriouslike , i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river .
i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there .
so i says : le's land on her , jim .
but jim was dead against it at first .
he says : i doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack .
we's doin' blame' well , en we better let blame' well alone , as de good book says .
like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack .
watchman your grandmother , i says ; there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse ; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this , when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute ?
jim couldn't say nothing to that , so he didn't try .
and besides , i says , we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom .
seegars , i bet youand cost five cents apiece , solid cash .
steamboat captains is always rich , and get sixty dollars a month , and they don't care a cent what a thing costs , you know , long as they want it .
stick a candle in your pocket ; i can't rest , jim , till we give her a rummaging .
do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing ?
not for pie , he wouldn't .
he'd call it an adventurethat's what he'd call it ; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act .
and wouldn't he throw style into it ?
wouldn'the spread himself , nor nothing ?
why , you'd think it was christopher c'lumbus discovering kingdomcome .
i wish tom sawyer was here .
jim he grumbled a little , but give in .
he said we mustn't talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low .
the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the stabboard derrick , and made fast there .
the deck was high out here .
we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard , in the dark , towards the texas , feeling our way slow with our feet , and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys , for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them .
pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight , and clumb on to it ; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door , which was open , and by jimminy , away down through the texashall we see a light !
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder !
jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along .
i says , all right , and was going to start for the raft ; but just then i heard a voice wail out and say : oh , please don't , boys ; i swear i won't ever tell !
another voice said , pretty loud : it's a lie , jim turner .
you've acted this way before .
you always want more'n your share of the truck , and you've always got it , too , because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell .
but this time you've said it jest one time too many .
you're the meanest , treacherousest hound in this country .
by this time jim was gone for the raft .
i was just abiling with curiosity ; and i says to myself , tom sawyer wouldn't back out now , and so i won't either ; i'm agoing to see what's going on here .
so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage , and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the texas .
then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot , and two men standing over him , and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand , and the other one had a pistol .
this one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor , and saying : i'd like to !
and i orter , tooa mean skunk !
the man on the floor would shrivel up and say , oh , please don't , bill ; i hain't ever goin' to tell .
and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : 'deed you ain't !
you never said no truer thing 'n that , you bet you .
and once he said : hear him beg !
and yit if we hadn't got the best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both .
and what for ?
jist for noth'n .
jist because we stood on our rightsthat's what for .
but i lay you ain't agoin' to threaten nobody any more , jim turner .
put up that pistol , bill .
bill says : i don't want to , jake packard .
i'm for killin' himand didn't he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand don't he deserve it ?
but i don't want him killed , and i've got my reasons for it .
bless yo' heart for them words , jake packard !
i'll never forgit you long's i live !
says the man on the floor , sort of blubbering .
packard didn't take no notice of that , but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark , and motioned bill to come .
i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards , but the boat slanted so that i couldn't make very good time ; so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side .
the man came apawing along in the dark , and when packard got to my stateroom , he says : herecome in here .
and in he come , and bill after him .
but before they got in i was up in the upper berth , cornered , and sorry i come .
then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked .
i couldn't see them , but i could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having .
i was glad i didn't drink whisky ; but it wouldn't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because i didn't breathe .
i was too scared .
and , besides , a body couldn't breathe and hear such talk .
they talked low and earnest .
bill wanted to kill turner .
he says : he's said he'll tell , and he will .
if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him .
shore's you're born , he'll turn state's evidence ; now you hear me .
i'm for putting him out of his troubles .
so'm i , says packard , very quiet .
blame it , i'd sorter begun to think you wasn't .
well , then , that's all right .
le's go and do it .
hold on a minute ; i hain't had my say yit .
you listen to me .
shooting's good , but there's quieter ways if the thing's got to be done .
but what i say is this : it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks .
ain't that so ?
you bet it is .
but how you goin' to manage it this time ?
well , my idea is this : we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck .
then we'll wait .
now i say it ain't agoin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river .
see ?
he'll be drownded , and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self .
i reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him .
i'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it ; it ain't good sense , it ain't good morals .
ain't i right ?
yes , i reck'n you are .
but s'pose she don't break up and wash off ?
well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , can't we ?
all right , then ; come along .
so they started , and i lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward .
it was dark as pitch there ; but i said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , jim !
and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and i says : quick , jim , it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning ; there's a gang of murderers in yonder , and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix .
but if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fixfor the sheriff 'll get 'em .
quickhurry !
i'll hunt the labboard side , you hunt the stabboard .
you start at the raft , and oh , my lordy , lordy !
raf' ?
dey ain' no raf' no mo' ; she done broke loose en gone ien here we is !
well , i catched my breath and most fainted .
shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that !
but it warn't no time to be sentimentering .
we'd got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves .
so we went aquaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , tooseemed a week before we got to the stern .
no sign of a boat .
jim said he didn't believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadn't hardly any strength left , he said .
but i said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure .
so on we prowled again .
we struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water .
when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff , sure enough !
i could just barely see her .
i felt ever so thankful .
in another second i would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened .
one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and i thought i was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : heave that blame lantern out o' sight , bill !
he flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down .
it was packard .
then bill he come out and got in .
packard says , in a low voice : all readyshove off !
i couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters , i was so weak .
but bill says : hold on'd you go through him ?
no .
didn't you ?
no .
so he's got his share o' the cash yet .
well , then , come along ; no use to take truck and leave money .
say , won't he suspicion what we're up to ?
maybe he won't .
but we got to have it anyway .
come along .
so they got out and went in .
the door slammed to because it was on the careened side ; and in a half second i was in the boat , and jim come tumbling after me .
i out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went !
we didn't touch an oar , and we didn't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe .
we went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the paddlebox , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it .
when we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was .
then jim manned the oars , and we took out after our raft .
now was the first time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadn't had time to before .
i begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix .
i says to myself , there ain't no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would i like it ?
so says i to jim : the first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it's a good hidingplace for you and the skiff , and then i'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be hung when their time comes .
but that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever .
the rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , i reckon .
we boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft .
after a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it .
it was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again .
we seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
so i said i would go for it .
the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck .
we hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and i told jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till i come ; then i manned my oars and shoved for the light .
as i got down towards it three or four more showedup on a hillside .
it was a village .
i closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated .
as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat .
i skimmed around for the watchman , awondering whereabouts he slept ; and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward , with his head down between his knees .
i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves , and begun to cry .
he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way ; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : hello , what's up ?
don't cry , bub .
what's the trouble ?
i says : pap , and mam , and sis , and then i broke down .
he says : oh , dang it now , don't take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this 'n 'll come out all right .
what's the matter with 'em ?
they'rethey'reare you the watchman of the boat ?
yes , he says , kind of prettywellsatisfied like .
i'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand ; and sometimes i'm the freight and passengers .
i ain't as rich as old jim hornback , and i can't be so blame' generous and good to tom , dick , and harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but i've told him a many a time 't i wouldn't trade places with him ; for , says i , a sailor's life's the life for me , and i'm derned if i'd live two mile out o' town , where there ain't nothing ever goin' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it .
says i i broke in and says : they're in an awful peck of trouble , and who is ?
why , pap and mam and sis and miss hooker ; and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there up where ?
where are they ?
on the wreck .
what wreck ?
why , there ain't but one .
what , you don't mean the walter scott ?
yes .
good land !
what are they doin' there , for gracious sakes ?
well , they didn't go there apurpose .
i bet they didn't !
why , great goodness , there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick !
why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ?
easy enough .
miss hooker was avisiting up there to the town yes , booth's landinggo on .
she was avisiting there at booth's landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay all night at her friend's house , miss whatyoumaycallher i disremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar , and swung around and went afloating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddlebaggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck .
well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow , and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so we saddlebaggsed ; but all of us was saved but bill whippleand oh , he was the best cretur !
imost wish 't it had been me , i do .
my george !
it's the beatenest thing i ever struck .
and then what did you all do ?
well , we hollered and took on , but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear .
so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow .
i was the only one that could swim , so i made a dash for it , and miss hooker she said if i didn't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he'd fix the thing .
i made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , 'what , in such a night and such a current ?
there ain't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry .
'now if you'll go and by jackson , i'd like to , and , blame it , i don't know but i will ; but who in the dingnation's agoing' to pay for it ?
do you reckon your pap why that's all right .
miss hooker she tole me , particular , that her uncle hornback great guns !
is he her uncle ?
looky here , you break for that light over yonderway , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to jim hornback's , and he'll foot the bill .
and don't you fool around any , because he'll want to know the news .
tell him i'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town .
hump yourself , now ; i'm agoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineer .
i struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for i couldn't rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start .
but take it all around , i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it .
i wished the widow knowed about it .
i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in .
well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down !
a kind of cold shiver went through me , and then i struck out for her .
she was very deep , and i see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her .
i pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there wasn't any answer ; all dead still .
i felt a little bit heavyhearted about the gang , but not much , for i reckoned if they could stand it i could .
then here comes the ferryboat ; so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant ; and when i judged i was out of eyereach i laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and i laid into my work and went abooming down the river .
it did seem a powerful long time before jim's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people .
by and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars .
we hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives .
the seegars was prime .
we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .
i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and i said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he didn't want no more adventures .
he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed ; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then miss watson would sell him south , sure .
well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger .
i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , 'stead of mister ; and jim's eyes bugged out , and he was interested .
he says : i didn' know dey was so many un um .
i hain't hearn 'bout none un um , skasely , but ole king sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards .
how much do a king git ?
get ?
i says ; why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them .
ain' dat gay ?
en what dey got to do , huck ?
they don't do nothing !
why , how you talk !
they just set around .
no ; is dat so ?
of course it is .
they just set aroundexcept , maybe , when there's a war ; then they go to the war .
but other times they just lazy around ; or go hawkingjust hawking and spsh !
d'you hear a noise ?
we skipped out and looked ; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back .
yes , says i , and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off .
but mostly they hang round the harem .
roun' de which ?
harem .
what's de harem ?
the place where he keeps his wives .
don't you know about the harem ?
solomon had one ; he had about a million wives .
why , yes , dat's so ; ii'd done forgot it .
a harem's a bo'd'nhouse , i reck'n .
mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery .
en i reck'n de wives quarrels considable ; en dat 'crease de racket .
yit dey say sollermun de wises' man dat ever live' .
i doan' take no stock in dat .
bekase why : would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a blimblammin' all de time ?
no'deed he wouldn't .
a wise man 'ud take en buil' a bilerfactry ; en den he could shet down de bilerfactry when he want to res' .
well , but he was the wisest man , anyway ; because the widow she told me so , her own self .
i doan k'yer what de widder say , he warn't no wise man nuther .
he had some er de dadfetchedes' ways i ever see .
does you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two ?
yes , the widow told me all about it .
well , den !
warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl' ?
you jes' take en look at it a minute .
dah's de stump , dahdat's one er de women ; heah's youdat's de yuther one ; i's sollermun ; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile .
bofe un you claims it .
what does i do ?
does i shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill do b'long to , en han' it over to de right one , all safe en soun' , de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would ?
no ; i take en whack de bill in two , en give half un it to you , en de yuther half to de yuther woman .
dat's de way sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile .
now i want to ast you : what's de use er dat half a bill ?
can'tbuy noth'n wid it .
en what use is a half a chile ?
i wouldn' give a dern for a million un um .
but hang it , jim , you've clean missed the pointblame it , you've missed it a thousand mile .
who ?
me ?
go 'long .
doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints .
i reck'n i knows sense when i sees it ; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as dat .
de 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile , de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile ; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain .
doan' talk to me 'bout sollermun , huck , i knows him by de back .
but i tell you you don't get the point .
blame de point !
i reck'n i knows what i knows .
en mine you , de real pint is down furderit's down deeper .
it lays in de way sollermun was raised .
you take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen ; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen ?
no , he ain't ; he can't 'ford it .
he know how to value 'em .
but you take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de house , en it's diffunt .
he as soon chop a chile in two as a cat .
dey's plenty mo' .
a chile er two , mo' er less , warn't no consekens to sollermun , dad fatch him !
i never see such a nigger .
if he got a notion in his head once , there warn't no getting it out again .
he was the most down on solomon of any nigger i ever see .
so i went to talking about other kings , and let solomon slide .
i told about louis sixteenth that got his head cut off in france long time ago ; and about his little boy the dolphin , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there .
po' little chap .
but some says he got out and got away , and come to america .
dat's good !
but he'll be pooty lonesomedey ain' no kings here , is dey , huck ?
no .
den he cain't git no situation .
what he gwyne to do ?
well , i don't know .
some of them gets on the police , and some of them learns people how to talk french .
why , huck , doan' de french people talk de same way we does ?
no , jim ; you couldn't understand a word they saidnot a single word .
well , now , i be dingbusted !
how do dat come ?
i don't know ; but it's so .
i got some of their jabber out of a book .
s'pose a man was to come to you and say pollyvoofranzywhat would you think ?
i wouldn' think nuff'n ; i'd take en bust him over de headdat is , if he warn't white .
i wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat .
shucks , it ain't calling you anything .
it's only saying , do you know how to talk french ?
well , den , why couldn't he say it ?
why , he is asaying it .
that's a frenchman's way of saying it .
well , it's a blame ridicklous way , en i doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout it .
dey ain' no sense in it .
looky here , jim ; does a cat talk like we do ?
no , a cat don't .
well , does a cow ?
no , a cow don't , nuther .
does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ?
no , dey don't .
it's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ain't it ?
course .
and ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from us ?
why , mos' sholy it is .
well , then , why ain't it natural and right for a frenchman to talk different from us ?
you answer me that .
is a cat a man , huck ?
no .
well , den , dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man .
is a cow a man ?
eris a cow a cat ?
no , she ain't either of them .
well , den , she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of 'em .
is a frenchman a man ?
yes .
well , den !
dad blame it , why doan' he talk like a man ?
you answer me dat !
i see it warn't no use wasting wordsyou can't learn a nigger to argue .
so i quit .
we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo , at the bottom of illinois , where the ohio river comes in , and that was what we was after .
we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states , and then be out of trouble .
well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog ; but when i paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to .
i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went .
i see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared i couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there warn't no raft in sight ; you couldn't see twenty yards .
i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke .
but she didn't come .
i was in such a hurry i hadn't untied her .
i got up and tried to untie her , but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldn't hardly do anything with them .
as soon as i got started i took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
that was all right as far as it went , but the towhead warn't sixty yards long , and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog , and hadn't no more idea which way i was going than a dead man .
thinks i , it won't do to paddle ; first i know i'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; i got to set still and float , and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time .
i whooped and listened .
away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits .
i went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again .
the next time it come i see i warn't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it .
and the next time i was heading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either , for i was flying around , this way and that and t'other , but it was going straight ahead all the time .
i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me .
well , i fought along , and directly i hears the whoop behind me .
i was tangled good now .
that was somebody else's whoop , or else i was turned around .
i throwed the paddle down .
i heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and i kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and i knowed the current had swung the canoe's head downstream , and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering .
i couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog .
the whooping went on , and in about a minute i come abooming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the currrent was tearing by them so swift .
in another second or two it was solid white and still again .
i set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and i reckon i didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred .
i just give up then .
i knowed what the matter was .
that cut bank was an island , and jim had gone down t'other side of it .
it warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes .
it had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
i kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , i reckon .
i was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour ; but you don't ever think of that .
no , you feel like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast you're going , but you catch your breath and think , my !
how that snag's tearing along .
if you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it onceyou'll see .
next , for about a half an hour , i whoops now and then ; at last i hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but i couldn't do it , and directly i judged i'd got into a nest of towheads , for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that i couldn't see i knowed was there because i'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks .
well , i warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ; and i only tried to chase them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a jacko'lantern .
you never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much .
i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster than what i was .
well , i seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but i couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres .
i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him .
i was good and tired , so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldn't bother no more .
i didn't want to go to sleep , of course ; but i was so sleepy i couldn't help it ; so i thought i would take jest one little catnap .
but i reckon it was more than a catnap , for when i waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and i was spinning down a big bend stern first .
first i didn't know where i was ; i thought i was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week .
it was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as i could see by the stars .
i looked away downstream , and seen a black speck on the water .
i took after it ; but when i got to it it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together .
then i see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time i was right .
it was the raft .
when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar .
the other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt .
so she'd had a rough time .
i made fast and laid down under jim's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against jim , and says : hello , jim , have i been asleep ?
why didn't you stir me up ?
goodness gracious , is dat you , huck ?
en you ain' deadyou ain' drowndedyou's back agin ?
it's too good for true , honey , it's too good for true .
lemme look at you chile , lemme feel o' you .
no , you ain' dead !
you's back agin , 'live en soun' , jis de same ole huckde same ole huck , thanks to goodness !
what's the matter with you , jim ?
you been adrinking ?
drinkin' ?
has i ben adrinkin' ?
has i had a chance to be adrinkin' ?
well , then , what makes you talk so wild ?
how does i talk wild ?
how ?
why , hain't you been talking about my coming back , and all that stuff , as if i'd been gone away ?
huckhuck finn , you look me in de eye ; look me in de eye .
hain't you ben gone away ?
gone away ?
why , what in the nation do you mean ?
i hain't been gone anywheres .
where would i go to ?
well , looky here , boss , dey's sumf'n wrong , dey is .
is i me , or who is i ?
is i heah , or whah is i ?
now dat's what i wants to know .
well , i think you're here , plain enough , but i think you're a tangleheaded old fool , jim .
i is , is i ?
well , you answer me dis : didn't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de towhead ?
no , i didn't .
what towhead ?
i hain't see no towhead .
you hain't seen no towhead ?
looky here , didn't de line pull loose en de raf' go ahummin' down de river , en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog ?
what fog ?
why , de fog !
defog dat's been aroun' all night .
en didn't you whoop , en didn't i whoop , tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los' , 'kase he didn' know whah he wuz ?
en didn't i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded ?
now ain' dat so , bossain't it so ?
you answer me dat .
well , this is too many for me , jim .
i hain't seen no fog , nor no islands , nor no troubles , nor nothing .
i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and i reckon i done the same .
you couldn't a got drunk in that time , so of course you've been dreaming .
dad fetch it , how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes ?
well , hang it all , you did dream it , because there didn't any of it happen .
but , huck , it's all jis' as plain to me as it don't make no difference how plain it is ; there ain't nothing in it .
i know , because i've been here all the time .
jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it .
then he says : well , den , i reck'n i did dream it , huck ; but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream i ever see .
en i hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one .
oh , well , that's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes .
but this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , jim .
so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable .
then he said he must start in and 'terpret it , because it was sent for a warning .
he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him .
the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck , 'stead of keeping us out of it .
the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free states , and wouldn't have no more trouble .
it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now .
oh , well , that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , jim , i says ; but what does these things stand for ?
it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar .
you could see them firstrate now .
jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again .
he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away .
but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : what do dey stan' for ?
i'se gwyne to tell you .
when i got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los' , en i didn' k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf' .
en when i wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en soun' , de tears come , en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot , i's so thankful .
en all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie .
dat truck dah is trash ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed .
then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that .
but that was enough .
it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back .
it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ; but i done it , and i warn't ever sorry for it afterwards , neither .
i didn't do him no more mean tricks , and i wouldn't done that one if i'd a knowed it would make him feel that way .
we slept most all day , and started out at night , a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession .
she had four long sweeps at each end , so we judged she carried as many as thirty men , likely .
she had five big wigwams aboard , wide apart , and an open camp fire in the middle , and a tall flagpole at each end .
there was a power of style about her .
it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that .
we went drifting down into a big bend , and the night clouded up and got hot .
the river was very wide , and was walled with solid timber on both sides ; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever , or a light .
we talked about cairo , and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it .
i said likely we wouldn't , because i had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there , and if they didn't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ?
jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show .
but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again .
that disturbed jimand me too .
so the question was , what to do ?
i said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a tradingscow , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to cairo .
jim thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited .
there warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it .
he said he'd be mighty sure to see it , because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom .
every little while he jumps up and says : dah she is ?
but it warn't .
it was jacko'lanterns , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before .
jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom .
well , i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish , too , to hear him , because i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it ?
why , me .
i couldn't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way .
it got to troubling me so i couldn't rest ; i couldn't stay still in one place .
it hadn't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that i was doing .
but now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more .
i tried to make out to myself that i warn't to blame , because i didn't run jim off from his rightful owner ; but it warn't no use , conscience up and says , every time , but you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody .
that was soi couldn't get around that noway .
that was where it pinched .
conscience says to me , what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ?
what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ?
why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how .
that's what she done .
i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead .
i fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and jim was fidgeting up and down past me .
we neither of us could keep still .
every time he danced around and says , dah's cairo !
it went through me like a shot , and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness .
jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself .
he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master wouldn't sell them , they'd get an ab'litionist to go and steal them .
it most froze me to hear such talk .
he wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before .
just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free .
it was according to the old saying , give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell .
thinks i , this is what comes of my not thinking .
here was this nigger , which i had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flatfooted and saying he would steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didn't even know ; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm .
i was sorry to hear jim say that , it was such a lowering of him .
my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last i says to it , let up on meit ain't too late yeti'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell .
i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off .
all my troubles was gone .
i went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself .
by and by one showed .
jim sings out : we's safe , huck , we's safe !
jump up and crack yo' heels !
dat's de good ole cairo at las' , i jis knows it !
i says : i'll take the canoe and go and see , jim .
it mightn't be , you know .
he jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as i shoved off , he says : pooty soon i'll be ashout'n' for joy , en i'll say , it's all on accounts o' huck ; i's a free man , en i couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for huck ; huck done it .
jim won't ever forgit you , huck ; you's de bes' fren' jim's ever had ; en you's de only fren' ole jim's got now .
i was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me .
i went along slow then , and i warn't right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warn't .
when i was fifty yards off , jim says : dah you goes , de ole true huck ; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole jim .
well , i just felt sick .
but i says , i got to do iti can't get out of it .
right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and i stopped .
one of them says : what's that yonder ?
a piece of a raft , i says .
do you belong on it ?
yes , sir .
any men on it ?
only one , sir .
well , there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder , above the head of the bend .
is your man white or black ?
i didn't answer up prompt .
i tried to , but the words wouldn't come .
i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but i warn't man enoughhadn't the spunk of a rabbit .
i see i was weakening ; so i just give up trying , and up and says : he's white .
i reckon we'll go and see for ourselves .
i wish you would , says i , because it's pap that's there , and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is .
he's sickand so is mam and mary ann .
oh , the devil !
we're in a hurry , boy .
but i s'pose we've got to .
come , buckle to your paddle , and let's get along .
i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars .
when we had made a stroke or two , i says : pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you , i can tell you .
everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and i can't do it by myself .
well , that's infernal mean .
odd , too .
say , boy , what's the matter with your father ?
it's theathewell , it ain't anything much .
they stopped pulling .
it warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now .
one says : boy , that's a lie .
what is the matter with your pap ?
answer up square now , and it'll be the better for you .
i will , sir , i will , honestbut don't leave us , please .
it's thethegentlemen , if you'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the headline , you won't have to come anear the raftplease do .
set her back , john , set her back !
says one .
they backed water .
keep away , boykeep to looard .
confound it , i just expect the wind has blowed it to us .
your pap's got the smallpox , and you know it precious well .
why didn't you come out and say so ?
do you want to spread it all over ?
well , says i , ablubbering , i've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us .
poor devil , there's something in that .
we are right down sorry for you , but wewell , hang it , we don't want the smallpox , you see .
look here , i'll tell you what to do .
don't you try to land by yourself , or you'll smash everything to pieces .
you float along down about twenty miles , and you'll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river .
it will be long after sunup then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever .
don't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter .
now we're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that's a good boy .
it wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light isit's only a woodyard .
say , i reckon your father's poor , and i'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck .
here , i'll put a twentydollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by .
i feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom !
it won't do to fool with smallpox , don't you see ?
hold on , parker , says the other man , here's a twenty to put on the board for me .
goodbye , boy ; you do as mr. parker told you , and you'll be all right .
that's so , my boygoodbye , goodbye .
if you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it .
goodbye , sir , says i ; i won't let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it .
they went off and i got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because i knowed very well i had done wrong , and i see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that don't get started right when he's little ain't got no showwhen the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat .
then i thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s'pose you'd a done right and give jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
no , says i , i'd feel badi'd feel just the same way i do now .
well , then , says i , what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same ?
i was stuck .
i couldn't answer that .
so i reckoned i wouldn't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time .
i went into the wigwam ; jim warn't there .
i looked all around ; he warn't anywhere .
i says : jim !
here i is , huck .
is dey out o' sight yit ?
don't talk loud .
he was in the river under the stern oar , with just his nose out .
i told him they were out of sight , so he come aboard .
he says : i was alistenin' to all de talk , en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard .
den i was gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone .
but lawsy , how you did fool 'em , huck !
dat wuz de smartes' dodge !
i tell you , chile , i'spec it save' ole jimole jim ain't going to forgit you for dat , honey .
then we talked about the money .
it was a pretty good raisetwenty dollars apiece .
jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states .
he said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there .
towards daybreak we tied up , and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good .
then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit rafting .
that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a lefthand bend .
i went off in the canoe to ask about it .
pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff , setting a trotline .
i ranged up and says : mister , is that town cairo ?
cairo ?
no .
you must be a blame' fool .
what town is it , mister ?
if you want to know , go and find out .
if you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't want .
i paddled to the raft .
jim was awful disappointed , but i said never mind , cairo would be the next place , i reckoned .
we passed another town before daylight , and i was going out again ; but it was high ground , so i didn't go .
no high ground about cairo , jim said .
i had forgot it .
we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the lefthand bank .
i begun to suspicion something .
so did jim .
i says : maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night .
he says : doan' le's talk about it , huck .
po' niggers can't have no luck .
i awluz 'spected dat rattlesnakeskin warn't done wid its work .
i wish i'd never seen that snakeskin , jimi do wish i'd never laid eyes on it .
it ain't yo' fault , huck ; you didn' know .
don't you blame yo'self 'bout it .
when it was daylight , here was the clear ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular muddy !
so it was all up with cairo .
we talked it all over .
it wouldn't do to take to the shore ; we couldn't take the raft up the stream , of course .
there warn't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances .
so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone !
we didn't say a word for a good while .
there warn't anything to say .
we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin ; so what was the use to talk about it ?
it would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still .
by and by we talked about what we better do , and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
we warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us .
so we shoved out after dark on the raft .
anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snakeskin , after all that that snakeskin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us .
the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore .
but we didn't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more .
well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog .
you can't tell the shape of the river , and you can't see no distance .
it got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river .
we lit the lantern , and judged she would see it .
upstream boats didn't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
we could hear her pounding along , but we didn't see her good till she was close .
she aimed right for us .
often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he's mighty smart .
well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit .
she was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us .
there was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft .
i divedand i aimed to find the bottom , too , for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me , and i wanted it to have plenty of room .
i could always stay under water a minute ; this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half .
then i bounced for the top in a hurry , for i was nearly busting .
i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit .
of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though i could hear her .
i sung out for jim about a dozen times , but i didn't get any answer ; so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water , and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me .
but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore , which meant that i was in a crossing ; so i changed off and went that way .
it was one of these long , slanting , twomile crossings ; so i was a good long time in getting over .
i made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank .
i couldn't see but a little ways , but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then i run across a big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it .
i was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and i knowed better than to move another peg .
in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : be done , boys !
who's there ?
i says : it's me .
who's me ?
george jackson , sir .
what do you want ?
i don't want nothing , sir .
i only want to go along by , but the dogs won't let me .
what are you prowling around here this time of night forhey ?
i warn't prowling around , sir , i fell overboard off of the steamboat .
oh , you did , did you ?
strike a light there , somebody .
what did you say your name was ?
george jackson , sir .
i'm only a boy .
look here , if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraidnobody'll hurt you .
but don't try to budge ; stand right where you are .
rouse out bob and tom , some of you , and fetch the guns .
george jackson , is there anybody with you ?
no , sir , nobody .
i heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light .
the man sung out : snatch that light away , betsy , you old foolain't you got any sense ?
put it on the floor behind the front door .
bob , if you and tom are ready , take your places .
all ready .
now , george jackson , do you know the shepherdsons ?
no , sir ; i never heard of them .
well , that may be so , and it mayn't .
now , all ready .
step forward , george jackson .
and mind , don't you hurrycome mighty slow .
if there's anybody with you , let him keep backif he shows himself he'll be shot .
come along now .
come slow ; push the door open yourselfjust enough to squeeze in , d' you hear ?
i didn't hurry ; i couldn't if i'd a wanted to .
i took one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound , only i thought i could hear my heart .
the dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me .
when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting .
i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , there , that's enoughput your head in .
i done it , but i judged they would take it off .
the candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , i tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady , and back of her two young women which i couldn't see right well .
the old gentleman says : there ; i reckon it's all right .
come in .
as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windowsthere warn't none on the side .
they held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , why , he ain't a shepherdsonno , there ain't any shepherdson about him .
then the old man said he hoped i wouldn't mind being searched for arms , because he didn't mean no harm by itit was only to make sure .
so he didn't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right .
he told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : why , bless you , saul , the poor thing's as wet as he can be ; and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry ?
true for you , racheli forgot .
so the old lady says : betsy this was a nigger woman , you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up buck and tell himoh , here he is himself .
buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry .
buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me .
he hadn't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzyheaded .
he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one .
he says : ain't they no shepherdsons around ?
they said , no , 'twas a false alarm .
well , he says , if they'd a ben some , i reckon i'd a got one .
they all laughed , and bob says : why , buck , they might have scalped us all , you've been so slow in coming .
well , nobody come after me , and it ain't right i'm always kept down ; i don't get no show .
never mind , buck , my boy , says the old man , you'll have show enough , all in good time , don't you fret about that .
go 'long with you now , and do as your mother told you .
when we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and i put them on .
while i was at it he asked me what my name was , but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out .
i said i didn't know ; i hadn't heard about it before , no way .
well , guess , he says .
how'm i going to guess , says i , when i never heard tell of it before ?
but you can guess , can't you ?
it's just as easy .
which candle ?
i says .
why , any candle , he says .
i don't know where he was , says i ; where was he ?
why , he was in the dark !
that's where he was !
well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for ?
why , blame it , it's a riddle , don't you see ?
say , how long are you going to stay here ?
you got to stay always .
we can just have booming timesthey don't have no school now .
do you own a dog ?
i've got a dogand he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in .
do you like to comb up sundays , and all that kind of foolishness ?
you bet i don't , but ma she makes me .
confound these ole britches !
i reckon i'd better put 'em on , but i'd ruther not , it's so warm .
are you all ready ?
all right .
come along , old hoss .
cold cornpone , cold cornbeef , butter and buttermilkthat is what they had for me down there , and there ain't nothing better that ever i've come across yet .
buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women .
they all smoked and talked , and i eat and talked .
the young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs .
they all asked me questions , and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw , and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more , and tom and mort died , and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died i took what there was left , because the farm didn't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how i come to be here .
so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it .
then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and i went to bed with buck , and when i waked up in the morning , drat it all , i had forgot what my name was .
so i laid there about an hour trying to think , and when buck waked up i says : can you spell , buck ?
yes , he says .
i bet you can't spell my name , says i .
i bet you what you dare i can , says he .
all right , says i , go ahead .
george jaxonthere now , he says .
well , says i , you done it , but i didn't think you could .
it ain't no slouch of a name to spellright off without studying .
i set it down , private , because somebody might want me to spell it next , and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it .
it was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too .
i hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style .
it didn't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town .
there warn't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them .
there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrown , same as they do in town .
they had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog .
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it .
it was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out .
they wouldn't took any money for her .
well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested .
they squeaked through underneath .
there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things .
on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath .
this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth , with a red and blue spreadeagle painted on it , and a painted border all around .
it come all the way from philadelphia , they said .
there was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table .
one was a big family bible full of pictures .
one was pilgrim's progress , about a man that left his family , it didn't say why .
i read considerable in it now and then .
the statements was interesting , but tough .
another was friendship's offering , full of beautiful stuff and poetry ; but i didn't read the poetry .
another was henry clay's speeches , and another was dr .
gunn's family medicine , which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead .
there was a hymn book , and a lot of other books .
and there was nice splitbottom chairs , and perfectly sound , toonot bagged down in the middle and busted , like an old basket .
they had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettes , and battles , and highland marys , and one called signing the declaration .
there was some that they called crayons , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old .
they was different from any pictures i ever see beforeblacker , mostly , than is common .
one was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping willow , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule , and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas .
another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas .
there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon , and tears running down her cheeks ; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it , and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth , and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas .
these was all nice pictures , i reckon , but i didn't somehow seem to take to them , because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fantods .
everybody was sorry she died , because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do , and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost .
but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard .
she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick , and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done , but she never got the chance .
it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown , standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off , with her hair all down her back , and looking up to the moon , with the tears running down her face , and she had two arms folded across her breast , and two arms stretched out in front , and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best , and then scratch out all the other arms ; but , as i was saying , she died before she got her mind made up , and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room , and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it .
other times it was hid with a little curtain .
the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face , but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery , seemed to me .
this young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive , and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer , and write poetry after them out of her own head .
it was very good poetry .
this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded : ode to stephen dowling bots , dec'd and did young stephen sicken ,  and did young stephen die ?
and did the sad hearts thicken ,  and did the mourners cry ?
no ; such was not the fate of  young stephen dowling bots ; though sad hearts round him thickened ,  'twas not from sickness' shots .
no whoopingcough did rack his frame ,  nor measles drear with spots ; not these impaired the sacred name  of stephen dowling bots .
despised love struck not with woe  that head of curly knots , nor stomach troubles laid him low ,  young stephen dowling bots .
o no .
then list with tearful eye ,  whilst i his fate do tell .
his soul did from this cold world fly  by falling down a well .
they got him out and emptied him ;  alas it was too late ; his spirit was gone for to sport aloft  in the realms of the good and great .
if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen , there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by .
buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing .
she didn't ever have to stop to think .
he said she would slap down a line , and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead .
she warn't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful .
every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold .
she called them tributes .
the neighbors said it was the doctor first , then emmeline , then the undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name , which was whistler .
she warn't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long .
poor thing , many's the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little .
i liked all that family , dead ones and all , and warn't going to let anything come between us .
poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but i couldn't seem to make it go somehow .
they kept emmeline's room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there .
the old lady took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly .
well , as i was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink .
there was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , i reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it .
the walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside .
it was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place .
nothing couldn't be better .
and warn't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too !
col .
grangerford was a gentleman , you see .
he was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family .
he was well born , as the saying is , and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the widow douglas said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself .
col .
grangerford was very tall and very slim , and had a darkishpaly complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say .
his forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders .
his hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it .
he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it .
there warn't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he warn't ever loud .
he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence .
sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards .
he didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmannered where he was .
everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was sunshine most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather .
when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week .
when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday , and didn't set down again till they had set down .
then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was , and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till tom's and bob's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , our duty to you , sir , and madam ; and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and buck , and we drank to the old people too .
bob was the oldest and tom nexttall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes .
they dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad panama hats .
then there was miss charlotte ; she was twentyfive , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father .
she was beautiful .
so was her sister , miss sophia , but it was a different kind .
she was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too .
my nigger had a monstrous easy time , because i warn't used to having anybody do anything for me , but buck's was on the jump most of the time .
this was all there was of the family now , but there used to be morethree sons ; they got killed ; and emmeline that died .
the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers .
sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such junketings round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes , and balls at the house nights .
these people was mostly kinfolks of the family .
the men brought their guns with them .
it was a handsome lot of quality , i tell you .
there was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six familiesmostly of the name of shepherdson .
they was as hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords .
the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses .
one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming .
we was crossing the road .
buck says : quick !
jump for the woods !
we done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves .
pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier .
he had his gun across his pommel .
i had seen him before .
it was young harney shepherdson .
i heard buck's gun go off at my ear , and harney's hat tumbled off from his head .
he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid .
but we didn't wait .
we started through the woods on a run .
the woods warn't thick , so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat , i reckon , but i couldn't see .
we never stopped running till we got home .
the old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute'twas pleasure , mainly , i judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : i don't like that shooting from behind a bush .
why didn't you step into the road , my boy ?
the shepherdsons don't , father .
they always take advantage .
miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped .
the two young men looked dark , but never said nothing .
miss sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt .
soon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves , i says : did you want to kill him , buck ?
well , i bet i did .
what did he do to you ?
him ?
he never done nothing to me .
well , then , what did you want to kill him for ?
why , nothingonly it's on account of the feud .
what's a feud ?
why , where was you raised ?
don't you know what a feud is ?
never heard of it beforetell me about it .
well , says buck , a feud is this way : a man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man's brother kills him ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the cousins chip inand by and by everybody's killed off , and there ain't no more feud .
but it's kind of slow , and takes a long time .
has this one been going on long , buck ?
well , i should reckon !
it started thirty year ago , or som'ers along there .
there was trouble 'bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do , of course .
anybody would .
what was the trouble about , buck ?
land ?
i reckon maybei don't know .
well , who done the shooting ?
was it a grangerford or a shepherdson ?
laws , how do i know ?
it was so long ago .
don't anybody know ?
oh , yes , pa knows , i reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place .
has there been many killed , buck ?
yes ; right smart chance of funerals .
but they don't always kill .
pa's got a few buckshot in him ; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much , anyway .
bob's been carved up some with a bowie , and tom's been hurt once or twice .
has anybody been killed this year , buck ?
yes ; we got one and they got one .
'bout three months ago my cousin bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river , and didn't have no weapon with him , which was blame' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him , and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair aflying in the wind ; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , bud 'lowed he could outrun him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man againing all the time ; so at last bud seen it warn't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down .
but he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid him out .
i reckon that old man was a coward , buck .
i reckon he warn't a coward .
not by a blame' sight .
there ain't a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one .
and there ain't no cowards amongst the grangerfords either .
why , that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords , and come out winner .
they was all ahorseback ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them .
him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the grangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day .
no , sir ; if a body's out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons , becuz they don't breed any of that kind .
next sunday we all went to church , about three mile , everybody ahorseback .
the men took their guns along , so did buck , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall .
the shepherdsons done the same .
it was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love , and suchlike tiresomeness ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination , and i don't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet .
about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull .
buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep .
i went up to our room , and judged i would take a nap myself .
i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if i liked her , and i said i did ; and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody , and i said i would .
then she said she'd forgot her testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody .
i said i would .
so i slid out and slipped off up the road , and there warn't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there warn't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because it's cool .
if you notice , most folks don't go to church only when they've got to ; but a hog is different .
says i to myself , something's up ; it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament .
so i give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil .
i ransacked it , but couldn't find anything else .
i couldn't make anything out of that , so i put the paper in the book again , and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me .
she pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said i was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody .
she was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty .
i was a good deal astonished , but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if i had read it , and i said no , and she asked me if i could read writing , and i told her no , only coarsehand , and then she said the paper warn't anything but a bookmark to keep her place , and i might go and play now .
i went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind .
when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes arunning , and says : mars jawge , if you'll come down into de swamp i'll show you a whole stack o' watermoccasins .
thinks i , that's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday .
he oughter know a body don't love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them .
what is he up to , anyway ?
so i says : all right ; trot ahead .
i followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile .
we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : you shove right in dah jist a few steps , mars jawge ; dah's whah dey is .
i's seed 'm befo' ; i don't k'yer to see 'em no mo' .
then he slopped right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him .
i poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines , and found a man laying there asleepand , by jings , it was my old jim !
i waked him up , and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it warn't .
he nearly cried he was so glad , but he warn't surprised .
said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but dasn't answer , because he didn't want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again .
says he : i got hurt a little , en couldn't swim fas' , so i wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las' ; when you landed i reck'ned i could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you , but when i see dat house i begin to go slow .
i 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to youi wuz 'fraid o' de dogs ; but when it 'uz all quiet agin i knowed you's in de house , so i struck out for de woods to wait for day .
early in de mawnin' some er de niggers come along , gwyne to de fields , en dey tuk me en showed me dis place , whah de dogs can't track me on accounts o' de water , en dey brings me truck to eat every night , en tells me how you's agitt'n along .
why didn't you tell my jack to fetch me here sooner , jim ?
well , 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you , huck , tell we could do sumfnbut we's all right now .
i ben abuyin' pots en pans en vittles , as i got a chanst , en apatchin' up de raf' nights when what raft , jim ?
our ole raf' .
you mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders ?
no , she warn't .
she was tore up a good dealone en' of her was ; but dey warn't no great harm done , on'y our traps was mos' all los' .
ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water , en de night hadn' ben so dark , en we warn't so sk'yerd , en ben sich punkinheads , as de sayin' is , we'd a seed de raf' .
but it's jis' as well we didn't , 'kase now she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new , en we's got a new lot o' stuff , in de place o' what 'uz los' .
why , how did you get hold of the raft again , jimdid you catch her ?
how i gwyne to ketch her en i out in de woods ?
no ; some er de niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben' , en dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows , en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat i come to heah 'bout it pooty soon , so i ups en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um , but to you en me ; en i ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty , en git a hid'n for it ?
den i gin 'm ten cents apiece , en dey 'uz mighty well satisfied , en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make 'm rich agin .
dey's mighty good to me , dese niggers is , en whatever i wants 'm to do fur me i doan' have to ast 'm twice , honey .
dat jack's a good nigger , en pooty smart .
yes , he is .
he ain't ever told me you was here ; told me to come , and he'd show me a lot of watermoccasins .
if anything happens he ain't mixed up in it .
he can say he never seen us together , and it 'll be the truth .
i don't want to talk much about the next day .
i reckon i'll cut it pretty short .
i waked up about dawn , and was agoing to turn over and go to sleep again when i noticed how still it wasdidn't seem to be anybody stirring .
that warn't usual .
next i noticed that buck was up and gone .
well , i gets up , awondering , and goes down stairsnobody around ; everything as still as a mouse .
just the same outside .
thinks i , what does it mean ?
down by the woodpile i comes across my jack , and says : what's it all about ?
says he : don't you know , mars jawge ?
no , says i , i don't .
well , den , miss sophia's run off !
'deed she has .
she run off in de night some timenobody don't know jis' when ; run off to get married to dat young harney shepherdson , you knowleastways , so dey 'spec .
de fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour agomaybe a little mo'en' i tell you dey warn't no time los' .
sich another hurryin' up guns en hosses you never see !
de women folks has gone for to stir up de relations , en ole mars saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin git acrost de river wid miss sophia .
i reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty rough times .
buck went off 'thout waking me up .
well , i reck'n he did !
dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it .
mars buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a shepherdson or bust .
well , dey'll be plenty un 'm dah , i reck'n , en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst .
i took up the river road as hard as i could put .
by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off .
when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place , and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach , and watched .
there was a woodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree , and first i was going to hide behind that ; but maybe it was luckier i didn't .
there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they couldn't come it .
every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at .
the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways .
by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling .
they started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the woodrank , and drops one of them out of his saddle .
all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run .
they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed .
then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them .
they gained on the boys , but it didn't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again .
one of the boys was buck , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old .
the men ripped around awhile , and then rode away .
as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him .
he didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first .
he was awful surprised .
he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or otherwouldn't be gone long .
i wished i was out of that tree , but i dasn't come down .
buck begun to cry and rip , and 'lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet .
he said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy .
said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush .
buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them .
i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia .
he said they'd got across the river and was safe .
i was glad of that ; but the way buck did take on because he didn't manage to kill harney that day he shot at himi hain't ever heard anything like it .
all of a sudden , bang !
bang !
bang !
goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses !
the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , kill them , kill them !
it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree .
i ain't agoing to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that .
i wished i hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things .
i ain't ever going to get shut of themlots of times i dream about them .
i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down .
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so i reckoned the trouble was still agoing on .
i was mighty downhearted ; so i made up my mind i wouldn't ever go anear that house again , because i reckoned i was to blame , somehow .
i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off ; and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened .
when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till i got them ashore ; then i covered up their faces , and got away as quick as i could .
i cried a little when i was covering up buck's face , for he was mighty good to me .
it was just dark now .
i never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
jim warn't on his island , so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , redhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country .
the raft was gone !
my souls , but i was scared !
i couldn't get my breath for most a minute .
then i raised a yell .
a voice not twentyfive foot from me says : good lan' !
is dat you , honey ?
doan' make no noise .
it was jim's voicenothing ever sounded so good before .
i run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and jim he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me .
he says : laws bless you , chile , i 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin .
jack's been heah ; he say he reck'n you's ben shot , kase you didn' come home no mo' ; so i's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de crick , so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead .
lawsy , i's mighty glad to git you back again , honey .
i says : all rightthat's mighty good ; they won't find me , and they'll think i've been killed , and floated down the riverthere's something up there that 'll help them think soso don't you lose no time , jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can .
i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi .
then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more .
i hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greensthere ain't nothing in the world so good when it's cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time .
i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was jim to get away from the swamp .
we said there warn't no home like a raft , after all .
other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft don't .
you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft .
two or three days and nights went by ; i reckon i might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely .
here is the way we put in the time .
it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile and a half wide ; we run nights , and laid up and hid daytimes ; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in the dead water under a towhead ; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows , and hid the raft with them .
then we set out the lines .
next we slid into the river and had a swim , so as to freshen up and cool off ; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep , and watched the daylight come .
not a sound anywheresperfectly stilljust like the whole world was asleep , only sometimes the bullfrogs acluttering , maybe .
the first thing to see , looking away over the water , was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on t'other side ; you couldn't make nothing else out ; then a pale place in the sky ; then more paleness spreading around ; then the river softened up away off , and warn't black any more , but gray ; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows , and such things ; and long black streaksrafts ; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking ; or jumbled up voices , it was so still , and sounds come so far ; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ; and you see the mist curl up off of the water , and the east reddens up , and the river , and you make out a logcabin in the edge of the woods , away on the bank on t'other side of the river , being a woodyard , likely , and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ; then the nice breeze springs up , and comes fanning you from over there , so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ; but sometimes not that way , because they've left dead fish laying around , gars and such , and they do get pretty rank ; and next you've got the full day , and everything smiling in the sun , and the songbirds just going it !
a little smoke couldn't be noticed now , so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast .
and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river , and kind of lazy along , and by and by lazy off to sleep .
wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream , so far off towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or sidewheel ; then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness .
next you'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a galoot on it chopping , because they're most always doing it on a raft ; you'd see the axe flash and come downyou don't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the k'chunk !
ithad took all that time to come over the water .
so we would put in the day , lazying around , listening to the stillness .
once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them .
a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain ; but we couldn't see no sign of them ; it made you feel crawly ; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air .
jim said he believed it was spirits ; but i says : no ; spirits wouldn't say , 'dern the dern fog .
'soon as it was night out we shoved ; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone , and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ; then we lit the pipes , and dangled our legs in the water , and talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked , day and night , whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes buck's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable , and besides i didn't go much on clothes , nohow .
sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time .
yonder was the banks and the islands , across the water ; and maybe a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window ; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow , you know ; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts .
it's lovely to live on a raft .
we had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened .
jim he allowed they was made , but i allowed they happened ; i judged it would have took too long to make so many .
jim said the moon could a laid them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so i didn't say nothing against it , because i've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done .
we used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down .
jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest .
once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark , and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys , and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ; and by and by her waves would get to us , a long time after she was gone , and joggle the raft a bit , and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long , except maybe frogs or something .
after midnight the people on shore went to bed , and then for two or three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows .
these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming , so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away .
one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods , to see if i couldn't get some berries .
just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it .
i thought i was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim .
i was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and sung out and begged me to save their livessaid they hadn't been doing nothing , and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming .
they wanted to jump right in , but i says : don't you do it .
i don't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthat'll throw the dogs off the scent .
they done it , and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting .
we heard them come along towards the crick , but couldn't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we couldn't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe .
one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers .
he had an old batteredup slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops , and homeknit gallusesno , he only had one .
he had an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , rattylooking carpetbags .
the other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery .
after breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another .
what got you into trouble ?
says the baldhead to t'other chap .
well , i'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with itbut i stayed about one night longer than i ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off .
so i told you i was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out with you .
that's the whole yarnwhat's yourn ?
well , i'd ben arunning' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for i was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies , i tell you , and takin' as much as five or six dollars a nightten cents a head , children and niggers freeand business agrowin' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that i had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the sly .
a nigger rousted me out this mornin' , and told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure .
i didn't wait for no breakfasti warn't hungry .
old man , said the young one , i reckon we might doubleteam it together ; what do you think ?
i ain't undisposed .
what's your linemainly ?
jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theateractortragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there's a chance ; teach singinggeography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimesoh , i do lots of thingsmost anything that comes handy , so it ain't work .
what's your lay ?
i've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time .
layin' on o' hands is my best holtfor cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and i k'n tell a fortune pretty good when i've got somebody along to find out the facts for me .
preachin's my line , too , and workin' campmeetin's , and missionaryin' around .
nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : alas !
what 're you alassin' about ?
says the baldhead .
to think i should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company .
and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
dern your skin , ain't the company good enough for you ?
says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish .
yes , it is good enough for me ; it's as good as i deserve ; for who fetched me so low when i was so high ?
i did myself .
i don't blame you , gentlemenfar from it ; i don't blame anybody .
i deserve it all .
let the cold world do its worst ; one thing i knowthere's a grave somewhere for me .
the world may go on just as it's always done , and take everything from meloved ones , property , everything ; but it can't take that .
some day i'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest .
he went on awiping .
drot your pore broken heart , says the baldhead ; what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f'r ?
we hain't done nothing .
no , i know you haven't .
i ain't blaming you , gentlemen .
i brought myself downyes , i did it myself .
it's right i should sufferperfectly righti don't make any moan .
brought you down from whar ?
whar was you brought down from ?
ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believeslet it pass'tis no matter .
the secret of my birth the secret of your birth !
do you mean to say gentlemen , says the young man , very solemn , i will reveal it to you , for i feel i may have confidence in you .
by rights i am a duke !
jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and i reckon mine did , too .
then the baldhead says : no !
you can't mean it ?
yes .
my greatgrandfather , eldest son of the duke of bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time .
the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored .
i am the lineal descendant of that infanti am the rightful duke of bridgewater ; and here am i , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heartbroken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft !
jim pitied him ever so much , and so did i .
we tried to comfort him , but he said it warn't much use , he couldn't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how .
he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say your grace , or my lord , or your lordshipand he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain bridgewater , which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
well , that was all easy , so we done it .
all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him , and says , will yo' grace have some o' dis or some o' dat ?
and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him .
but the old man got pretty silent by and bydidn't have much to say , and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke .
he seemed to have something on his mind .
so , along in the afternoon , he says : looky here , bilgewater , he says , i'm nation sorry for you , but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that .
no ?
no you ain't .
you ain't the only person that's ben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place .
alas !
no , you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth .
and , by jings , he begins to cry .
hold !
what do you mean ?
bilgewater , kin i trust you ?
says the old man , still sort of sobbing .
to the bitter death !
he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , that secret of your being : speak !
bilgewater , i am the late dauphin !
you bet you , jim and me stared this time .
then the duke says : you are what ?
yes , my friend , it is too trueyour eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin , looy the seventeen , son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette .
you !
at your age !
no !
you mean you're the late charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least .
trouble has done it , bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude .
yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin' , exiled , trampledon , and sufferin' rightful king of france .
well , he cried and took on so that me and jim didn't know hardly what to do , we was so sorryand so glad and proud we'd got him with us , too .
so we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort him .
but he said it warn't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him your majesty , and waited on him first at meals , and didn't set down in his presence till he asked them .
so jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t'other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down .
this done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable .
but the duke kind of soured on him , and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke's greatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft , bilgewater , and so what's the use o' your bein' sour ?
it 'll only make things oncomfortable .
it ain't my fault i warn't born a duke , it ain't your fault you warn't born a kingso what's the use to worry ?
make the best o' things the way you find 'em , says ithat's my motto .
this ain't no bad thing that we've struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome , give us your hand , duke , and le's all be friends .
the duke done it , and jim and me was pretty glad to see it .
it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others .
it didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all , but just lowdown humbugs and frauds .
but i never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it's the best way ; then you don't have no quarrels , and don't get into no trouble .
if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , i hadn't no objections , 'long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it warn't no use to tell jim , so i didn't tell him .
if i never learnt nothing else out of pap , i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
they asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of runningwas jim a runaway nigger ?
says i : goodness sakes !
would a runaway nigger run south ?
no , they allowed he wouldn't .
i had to account for things some way , so i says : my folks was living in pike county , in missouri , where i was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike .
pa , he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with uncle ben , who's got a little onehorse place on the river , fortyfour mile below orleans .
pa was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , jim .
that warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way .
well , when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we'd go down to orleans on it .
pa's luck didn't hold out ; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; jim and me come up all right , but pa was drunk , and ike was only four years old , so they never come up no more .
well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger .
we don't run daytimes no more now ; nights they don't bother us .
the duke says : leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to .
i'll think the thing overi'll invent a plan that'll fix it .
we'll let it alone for today , because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylightit mightn't be healthy .
towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky , and the leaves was beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly , it was easy to see that .
so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam , to see what the beds was like .
my bed was a straw tick better than jim's , which was a cornshuck tick ; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up .
well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he wouldn't .
he says : i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on .
your grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself .
jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : 'tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression .
misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; i yield , i submit ; 'tis my fate .
i am alone in the worldlet me suffer ; can bear it .
we got away as soon as it was good and dark .
the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town .
we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and bythat was the town , you knowand slid by , about a half a mile out , all right .
when we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night .
it was my watch below till twelve , but i wouldn't a turned in anyway if i'd had a bed , because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight .
my souls , how the wind did scream along !
and every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half a mile around , and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a hwhack !
bum !
bum !
bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quitand then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager .
the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but i hadn't any clothes on , and didn't mind .
we didn't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them .
i had the middle watch , you know , but i was pretty sleepy by that time , so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me ; he was always mighty good that way , jim was .
i crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for me ; so i laid outsidei didn't mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves warn't running so high now .
about two they come up again , though , and jim was going to call me ; but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm ; but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard .
it most killed jim alaughing .
he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway .
i took the watch , and jim he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first cabinlight that showed i rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day .
the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played sevenup a while , five cents a game .
then they got tired of it , and allowed they would lay out a campaign , as they called it .
the duke went down into his carpetbag , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud .
one bill said , the celebrated dr .
armand de montalban , of paris , would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece .
the duke said that was him .
in another bill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian , garrick the younger , of drury lane , london .
in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things , like finding water and gold with a diviningrod , dissipating witch spells , and so on .
by and by he says : but the histrionic muse is the darling .
have you ever trod the boards , royalty ?
no , says the king .
you shall , then , before you're three days older , fallen grandeur , says the duke .
the first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii .
and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet .
how does that strike you ?
i'm in , up to the hub , for anything that will pay , bilgewater ; but , you see , i don't know nothing about playactin' , and hain't ever seen much of it .
i was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace .
do you reckon you can learn me ?
easy !
all right .
i'm jist afreezn' for something fresh , anyway .
le's commence right away .
so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was , and said he was used to being romeo , so the king could be juliet .
but if juliet's such a young gal , duke , my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her , maybe .
no , don't you worry ; these country jakes won't ever think of that .
besides , you know , you'll be in costume , and that makes all the difference in the world ; juliet's in a balcony , enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed , and she's got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap .
here are the costumes for the parts .
he got out two or three curtaincalico suits , which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii .
and t'other chap , and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match .
the king was satisfied ; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way , prancing around and acting at the same time , to show how it had got to be done ; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart .
there was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing .
the king allowed he would go , too , and see if he couldn't strike something .
we was out of coffee , so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
when we got there there warn't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like sunday .
we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting , about two mile back in the woods .
the king got the directions , and allowed he'd go and work that campmeeting for all it was worth , and i might go , too .
the duke said what he was after was a printingoffice .
we found it ; a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked .
it was a dirty , litteredup place , and had ink marks , and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls .
the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now .
so me and the king lit out for the campmeeting .
we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day .
there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around .
the woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies .
there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck .
the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people .
the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs .
they didn't have no backs .
the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds .
the women had on sunbonnets ; and some had linseywoolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico .
some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt .
some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly .
the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn .
he lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to singand so on .
the people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout .
then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in earnest , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then aleaning down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , it's the brazen serpent in the wilderness !
look upon it and live !
and people would shout out , glory !
aamen !
and so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : oh , come to the mourners' bench !
come , black with sin !
amen !
come , sick and sore !
amen !
come , lame and halt and blind !
amen !
come , pore and needy , sunk in shame !
aamen !
come , all that's worn and soiled and suffering !
comewith a broken spirit !
come with a contrite heart !
come in your rags and sin and dirt !
the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands openoh , enter in and be at rest !
aamen !
glory , glory hallelujah !
and so on .
you couldn't make out what the preacher said any more , on account of the shouting and crying .
folks got up everywheres in the crowd , and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench , with the tears running down their faces ; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd , they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw , just crazy and wild .
well , the first i knowed the king got agoing , and you could hear him over everybody ; and next he went acharging up on to the platform , and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people , and he done it .
he told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the indian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight , and he was home now to take out some fresh men , and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent , and he was glad of it ; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him , because he was a changed man now , and happy for the first time in his life ; and , poor as he was , he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean , and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ; for he could do it better than anybody else , being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money , he would get there anyway , and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him , don't you thank me , don't you give me no credit ; it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeeting , natural brothers and benefactors of the race , and that dear preacher there , the truest friend a pirate ever had !
and then he busted into tears , and so did everybody .
then somebody sings out , take up a collection for him , take up a collection !
well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , let him pass the hat around !
then everybody said it , the preacher too .
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six timesand he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldn't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents .
and then he had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods .
the king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the missionarying line .
he said it warn't no use talking , heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with .
the duke was thinking he'd been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he didn't think so so much .
he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse billsand took the money , four dollars .
and he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it .
the price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash .
he set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was , yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and didn't charge nothing for it .
well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it .
then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for , because it was for us .
it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder , and 200 reward under it .
the reading was all about jim , and just described him to a dot .
it said he run away from st .
jacques' plantation , forty mile below new orleans , last winter , and likely went north , and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses .
now , says the duke , after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to .
whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward .
handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim , but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor .
too much like jewelry .
ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities , as we say on the boards .
we all said the duke was pretty smart , and there couldn't be no trouble about running daytimes .
we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to .
we laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it .
when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : huck , does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip ?
no , i says , i reckon not .
well , says he , dat's all right , den .
i doan' mine one er two kings , but dat's enough .
dis one's powerful drunk , en de duke ain' much better .
i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he'd forgot it .
it was after sunup now , but we went right on and didn't tie up .
the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ; but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal .
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches , and let his legs dangle in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart .
when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together .
the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; only , he says , you mustn't bellow out romeo !
that way , like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy , soroomeo !
that is the idea ; for juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she doesn't bray like a jackass .
well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths , and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii .
 ;and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see .
but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river .
after dinner the duke says : well , capet , we'll want to make this a firstclass show , you know , so i guess we'll add a little more to it .
we want a little something to answer encores with , anyway .
what's onkores , bilgewater ?
the duke told him , and then says : i'll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe ; and youwell , let me seeoh , i've got ityou can do hamlet's soliloquy .
hamlet's which ?
hamlet's soliloquy , you know ; the most celebrated thing in shakespeare .
ah , it's sublime , sublime !
always fetches the house .
i haven't got it in the booki've only got one volumebut i reckon i can piece it out from memory .
i'll just walk up and down a minute , and see if i can call it back from recollection's vaults .
so he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then ; then he would hoist up his eyebrows ; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ; next he would sigh , and next he'd let on to drop a tear .
it was beautiful to see him .
by and by he got it .
he told us to give attention .
then he strikes a most noble attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky ; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ; and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before .
this is the speechi learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : to be , or not to be ; that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life ; for who would fardels bear , till birnam wood do come to dunsinane , but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep , great nature's second course , and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of .
there's the respect must give us pause : wake duncan with thy knocking !
i would thou couldst ; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , the law's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take .
in the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black , but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , breathes forth contagion on the world , and thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i' the adage , is sicklied o'er with care .
and all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , with this regard their currents turn awry , and lose the name of action .
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
but soft you , the fair ophelia : ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws .
but get thee to a nunnerymdash ;go !
well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate .
it seemed like he was just born for it ; and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off .
the first chance we got , the duke he had some show bills printed ; and after that , for two or three days as we floated along , the raft was a most uncommon lively place , for there warn't nothing but swordfighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time .
one morning , when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw , we come in sight of a little onehorse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about threequarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show .
we struck it mighty lucky ; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon , and the country people was already beginning to come in , in all kinds of old shackly wagons , and on horses .
the circus would leave before night , so our show would have a pretty good chance .
the duke he hired the court house , and we went around and stuck up our bills .
they read like this : shaksperean revival !
 !
 !
wonderful attraction !
for one night only !
the world renowned tragedians , david garrick the younger , of drury lane theatre , london , and edmund kean the elder , of the royal haymarket theatre , whitechapel , pudding lane , piccadilly , london , and the royal continental theatres , in their sublime shaksperean spectacle entitled the balcony scene in romeo and juliet !

mr. kean .
also : by special request , hamlet's immortal soliloquy !
 !
by the illustrious kean !
done by him 300 consecutive nights in paris !
for one night only , on account of imperative european engagements !
admission 25 cents ; children and servants , 10 cents .
then we went loafing around the town .
the stores and houses was most all old shackly driedup frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed .
the houses had little gardens around them , but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds , and sunflowers , and ashpiles , and old curledup boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and playedout tinware .
the fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every whichway , and had gates that didn't generly have but one hingea leather one .
some of the fences had been whitewashed , some time or another , but the duke said it was in clumbus's time , like enough .
there was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out .
all the stores was along one street .
they had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts .
there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , whittling them with their barlow knives ; and chawing tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot .
they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats , they called one another bill , and buck , and hank , and joe , and andy , and talked lazy and drawly , and used considerable many cuss words .
there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awningpost , and he most always had his hands in his britchespockets , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch .
what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : gimme a chaw 'v tobacker , hank .
cain't ; i hain't got but one chaw left .
ask bill .
maybe bill he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ain't got none .
some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own .
they get all their chawing by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , i wisht you'd len' me a chaw , jack , i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime ; it don't fool nobody but a stranger ; but jack ain't no stranger , so he says : you give him a chaw , did you ?
so did your sister's cat's grandmother .
you pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me , lafe buckner , then i'll loan you one or two ton of it , and won't charge you no back intrust , nuther .
well , i did pay you back some of it wunst .
yes , you did'bout six chaws .
you borry'd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead .
store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted .
when they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back , and says , sarcastic : here , gimme the chaw , and you take the plug .
all the streets and lanes was just mud ; they warn't nothing else but mudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in all the places .
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres .
you'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary .
and pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out , hi !
so boy !
sick him , tige !
and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more acoming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise .
then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight .
there couldn't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death .
on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank , and they was bowed and bent , and about ready to tumble in .
the people had moved out of them .
the bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over .
people lived in them yet , but it was dangersome , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time .
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer .
such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river's always gnawing at it .
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time .
families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons .
there was considerable whisky drinking going on , and i seen three fights .
by and by somebody sings out : here comes old boggs !
infrom the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys !
all the loafers looked glad ; i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs .
one of them says : wonder who he's agwyne to chaw up this time .
if he'd achawed up all the men he's ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now .
another one says , i wisht old boggs 'd threaten me , 'cuz then i'd know i warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year .
boggs comes atearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an injun , and singing out : cler the track , thar .
i'm on the wawpath , and the price uv coffins is agwyne to raise .
he was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face .
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him , and he sassed back , and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old colonel sherburn , and his motto was , meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on .
he see me , and rode up and says : whar'd you come f'm , boy ?
you prepared to die ?
then he rode on .
i was scared , but a man says : he don't mean nothing ; he's always acarryin' on like that when he's drunk .
he's the best naturedest old fool in arkansawnever hurt nobody , drunk nor sober .
boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : come out here , sherburn !
come out and meet the man you've swindled .
you're the houn' i'm after , and i'm agwyne to have you , too !
and so he went on , calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to , and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on .
by and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a heap the best dressed man in that town , toosteps out of the store , and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come .
he says to boggs , mighty ca'm and slowhe says : i'm tired of this , but i'll endure it till one o'clock .
till one o'clock , mindno longer .
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but i will find you .
then he turns and goes in .
the crowd looked mighty sober ; nobody stirred , and there warn't no more laughing .
boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell , all down the street ; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store , still keeping it up .
some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up , but he wouldn't ; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes , and so he must go homehe must go right away .
but it didn't do no good .
he cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again , with his gray hair aflying .
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it warn't no useup the street he would tear again , and give sherburn another cussing .
by and by somebody says : go for his daughter !
quick ,go for his daughter ; sometimes he'll listen to her .
if anybody can persuade him , she can .
so somebody started on a run .
i walked down street a ways and stopped .
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again , but not on his horse .
he was areeling across the street towards me , bareheaded , with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along .
he was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he warn't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
somebody sings out : boggs !
i looked over there to see who said it , and it was that colonel sherburn .
he was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky .
the same second i see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her .
boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels cocked .
boggs throws up both of his hands and says , o lord , don't shoot !
bang !
goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the airbang !
goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out .
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , oh , he's killed him , he's killed him !
the crowd closed up around them , and shouldered and jammed one another , with their necks stretched , trying to see , and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting , back , back !
give him air , give him air !
colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off .
they took boggs to a little drug store , the crowd pressing around just the same , and the whole town following , and i rushed and got a good place at the window , where i was close to him and could see in .
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head , and opened another one and spread it on his breast ; but they tore open his shirt first , and i seen where one of the bullets went in .
he made about a dozen long gasps , his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath , and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid still ; he was dead .
then they pulled his daughter away from him , screaming and crying , and took her off .
she was about sixteen , and very sweet and gentle looking , but awful pale and scared .
well , pretty soon the whole town was there , squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look , but people that had the places wouldn't give them up , and folks behind them was saying all the time , say , now , you've looked enough , you fellows ; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time , and never give nobody a chance ; other folks has their rights as well as you .
there was considerable jawing back , so i slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble .
the streets was full , and everybody was excited .
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening .
one long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a crookedhandled cane , marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood , frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes , and sung out , boggs !
and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says bang !
staggered backwards , says bang !
again , and fell down flat on his back .
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened .
then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him .
well , by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched .
in about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with .
they swarmed up towards sherburn's house , awhooping and raging like injuns , and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush , and it was awful to see .
children was heeling it ahead of the mob , screaming and trying to get out of the way ; and every window along the road was full of women's heads , and there was nigger boys in every tree , and bucks and wenches looking over every fence ; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach .
lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on , scared most to death .
they swarmed up in front of sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together , and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise .
it was a little twentyfoot yard .
some sung out tear down the fence !
tear down the fence !
then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing , and down she goes , and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave .
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch , with a doublebarrel gun in his hand , and takes his stand , perfectly ca'm and deliberate , not saying a word .
the racket stopped , and the wave sucked back .
sherburn never said a wordjust stood there , looking down .
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable .
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him , but they couldn't ; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky .
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it .
then he says , slow and scornful : the idea of you lynching anybody !
it's amusing .
the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man !
because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man ?
why , a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as it's daytime and you're not behind him .
do i know you ?
i know you clear through .
i was born and raised in the south , and i've lived in the north ; so i know the average all around .
the average man's a coward .
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it .
in the south one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot .
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas you're just as brave , and no braver .
why don't your juries hang murderers ?
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back , in the darkand it's just what they would do .
so they always acquit ; and then a man goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal .
your mistake is , that you didn't bring a man with you ; that's one mistake , and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks .
you brought part of a manbuck harkness , thereand if you hadn't had him to start you , you'd a taken it out in blowing .
you didn't want to come .
the average man don't like trouble and danger .
you don't like trouble and danger .
but if only half a manlike buck harkness , thereshouts 'lynch him !
lynch him !
'you're afraid to back downafraid you'll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you raise a yell , and hang yourselves on to that halfaman's coattail , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you're going to do .
the pitifulest thing out is a mob ; that's what an army isa mob ; they don't fight with courage that's born in them , but with courage that's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers .
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness .
now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole .
if any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark , southern fashion ; and when they come they'll bring their masks , and fetch a man along .
now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this .
the crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and buck harkness he heeled it after them , looking tolerable cheap .
i could a stayed if i wanted to , but i didn't want to .
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent .
i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money , but i reckoned i better save it , because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way .
you can't be too careful .
i ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way , but there ain't no use in wasting it on them .
it was a real bully circus .
it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds .
it was a powerful fine sight ; i never see anything so lovely .
and then one by one they got up and stood , and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the tentroof , and every lady's roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol .
and then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole , cracking his whip and shouting hi !
hi !
and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves !
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow i ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild .
well , all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people .
the ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever could think of so many of them , and so sudden and so pat , was what i couldn't noway understand .
why , i couldn't a thought of them in a year .
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was .
they argued and tried to keep him out , but he wouldn't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill .
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him , and that made him mad , and he begun to rip and tear ; so that stirred up the people , and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring , saying , knock him down !
throw him out !
and one or two women begun to scream .
so , then , the ringmaster he made a little speech , and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance , and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse .
so everybody laughed and said all right , and the man got on .
the minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down .
and at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t'other one on t'other side , and the people just crazy .
it warn't funny to me , though ; i was all of a tremble to see his danger .
but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle , areeling this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood !
and the horse agoing like a house afire too .
he just stood up there , asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them .
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits .
and , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom , and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment .
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see , i reckon .
why , it was one of his own men !
he had got up that joke all out of his own head , and never let on to nobody .
well , i felt sheepish enough to be took in so , but i wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place , not for a thousand dollars .
i don't know ; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was , but i never struck them yet .
anyways , it was plenty good enough for me ; and wherever i run across it , it can have all of my custom every time .
well , that night we had our show ; but there warn't only about twelve people therejust enough to pay expenses .
and they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep .
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned .
he said he could size their style .
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village .
the bills said : well , all day him and the king was hard at it , rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights ; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time .
when the place couldn't hold no more , the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech , and praised up this tragedy , and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was ; and so he went on abragging about the tragedy , and about edmund kean the elder , which was to play the main principal part in it ; and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough , he rolled up the curtain , and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours , naked ; and he was painted all over , ringstreakedandstriped , all sorts of colors , as splendid as a rainbow .
andbut never mind the rest of his outfit ; it was just wild , but it was awful funny .
the people most killed themselves laughing ; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes , they roared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again , and after that they made him do it another time .
well , it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut .
then the duke he lets the curtain down , and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more , on accounts of pressing london engagements , where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane ; and then he makes them another bow , and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them , he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it .
twenty people sings out : what , is it over ?
is that all ?
the duke says yes .
then there was a fine time .
everybody sings out , sold !
and rose up mad , and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians .
but a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : hold on !
just a word , gentlemen .
they stopped to listen .
we are soldmighty badly sold .
but we don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , i reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live .
no .
what we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the rest of the town !
then we'll all be in the same boat .
ain't that sensible ?
you bet it is !
thejedge is right !
everybody sings out .
all right , thennot a word about any sell .
go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy .
next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was .
house was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way .
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town .
the third night the house was crammed againand they warn't newcomers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights .
i stood by the duke at the door , and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coatand i see it warn't no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight .
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around , and i bet i do , there was sixtyfour of them went in .
i shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; i couldn't stand it .
well , when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , i after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you !
i done it , and he done the same .
we struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word .
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : well , how'd the old thing pan out this time , duke ?
he hadn't been uptown at all .
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village .
then we lit up and had a supper , and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people .
the duke says : greenhorns , flatheads !
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ; and i knew they'd lay for us the third night , and consider it was their turn now .
well , it is their turn , and i'd give something to know how much they'd take for it .
i would just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity .
they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions .
them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that three nights .
i never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before .
by and by , when they was asleep and snoring , jim says : don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on , huck ?
no , i says , it don't .
why don't it , huck ?
well , it don't , because it's in the breed .
i reckon they're all alike .
but , huck , dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions ; dat's jist what dey is ; dey's reglar rapscallions .
well , that's what i'm asaying ; all kings is mostly rapscallions , as fur as i can make out .
is dat so ?
you read about them onceyou'll see .
look at henry the eight ; this 'n 's a sundayschool superintendent to him .
and look at charles second , and louis fourteen , and louis fifteen , and james second , and edward second , and richard third , and forty more ; besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain .
my , you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom .
he was a blossom .
he used to marry a new wife every day , and chop off her head next morning .
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs .
'fetch up nell gwynn ,' he says .
they fetch her up .
next morning , 'chop off her head !
'and they chop it off .
'fetch up jane shore ,' he says ; and up she comes , next morning , 'chop off her head'and they chop it off .
'ring up fair rosamun .
'fair rosamun answers the bell .
next morning , 'chop off her head .
'and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night ; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way , and then he put them all in a book , and called it domesday bookwhich was a good name and stated the case .
you don't know kings , jim , but i know them ; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i've struck in history .
well , henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country .
how does he go at itgive notice ?
givethe country a show ?
no .
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard , and whacks out a declaration of independence , and dares them to come on .
that was his stylehe never give anybody a chance .
he had suspicions of his father , the duke of wellington .
well , what did he do ?
ask him to show up ?
nodrownded him in a butt of mamsey , like a cat .
s'pose people left money laying around where he waswhat did he do ?
he collared it .
s'pose he contracted to do a thing , and you paid him , and didn't set down there and see that he done itwhat did he do ?
he always done the other thing .
s'pose he opened his mouthwhat then ?
if he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time .
that's the kind of a bug henry was ; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done .
i don't say that ourn is lambs , because they ain't , when you come right down to the cold facts ; but they ain't nothing to that old ram , anyway .
all i say is , kings is kings , and you got to make allowances .
take them all around , they're a mighty ornery lot .
it's the way they're raised .
but dis one do smell so like de nation , huck .
well , they all do , jim .
we can't help the way a king smells ; history don't tell no way .
now de duke , he's a tolerble likely man in some ways .
yes , a duke's different .
but not very different .
this one's a middling hard lot for a duke .
when he's drunk there ain't no nearsighted man could tell him from a king .
well , anyways , i doan' hanker for no mo' un um , huck .
dese is all i kin stan' .
it's the way i feel , too , jim .
but we've got them on our hands , and we got to remember what they are , and make allowances .
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings .
what was the use to tell jim these warn't real kings and dukes ?
it wouldn't a done no good ; and , besides , it was just as i said : you couldn't tell them from the real kind .
i went to sleep , and jim didn't call me when it was my turn .
he often done that .
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees , moaning and mourning to himself .
i didn't take notice nor let on .
i knowed what it was about .
he was thinking about his wife and his children , away up yonder , and he was low and homesick ; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life ; and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n .
it don't seem natural , but i reckon it's so .
he was often moaning and mourning that way nights , when he judged i was asleep , and saying , po' little 'lizabeth !
po' little johnny !
it's mighty hard ; i spec' i ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo' , no mo' !
he was a mighty good nigger , jim was .
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones ; and by and by he says : what makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack , er a slam , while ago , en it mine me er de time i treat my little 'lizabeth so ornery .
she warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole , en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever , en had a powful rough spell ; but she got well , en one day she was astannin' aroun' , en i says to her , i says : 'shet de do' .
'she never done it ; jis' stood dah , kiner smilin' up at me .
it make me mad ; en i says agin , mighty loud , i says : 'doan' you hear me ?
shet de do' !
'she jis stood de same way , kiner smilin' up .
i was abilin' !
i says : 'i lay i make you mine !
'en wid dat i fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her asprawlin' .
den i went into de yuther room , en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes ; en when i come back dah was dat do' astannin' open yit , en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it , alookin' down and mournin' , en de tears runnin' down .
my , but i wuz mad !
i was agwyne for de chile , but jis' denit was a do' dat open innerdsjis' den , 'long come de wind en slam it to , behine de chile , kerblam !
enmy lan' , de chile never move' !
my breff mos' hop outer me ; en i feel sosoi doan' know how i feel .
i crope out , all atremblin' , en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow , en poke my head in behine de chile , sof' en still , en all uv a sudden i says pow !
jis' as loud as i could yell .
she never budge !
oh , huck , i bust out acryin' en grab her up in my arms , en say , 'oh , de po' little thing !
de lord god amighty fogive po' ole jim , kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long's he live !
'oh , she was plumb deef en dumb , huck , plumb deef en dumben i'd ben atreat'n her so !
next day , towards night , we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle , where there was a village on each side of the river , and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns .
jim he spoke to the duke , and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours , because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope .
you see , when we left him all alone we had to tie him , because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger , you know .
so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day , and he'd cipher out some way to get around it .
he was uncommon bright , the duke was , and he soon struck it .
he dressed jim up in king lear's outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown , and a white horsehair wig and whiskers ; and then he took his theater paint and painted jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead , dull , solid blue , like a man that's been drownded nine days .
blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage i ever see .
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so : sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head .
and he nailed that shingle to a lath , and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam .
jim was satisfied .
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day , and trembling all over every time there was a sound .
the duke told him to make himself free and easy , and if anybody ever come meddling around , he must hop out of the wigwam , and carry on a little , and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast , and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone .
which was sound enough judgment ; but you take the average man , and he wouldn't wait for him to howl .
why , he didn't only look like he was dead , he looked considerable more than that .
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again , because there was so much money in it , but they judged it wouldn't be safe , because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time .
they couldn't hit no project that suited exactly ; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the arkansaw village ; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan , but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil , i reckon .
we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last ; and now the king put his'n on , and he told me to put mine on .
i done it , of course .
the king's duds was all black , and he did look real swell and starchy .
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before .
why , before , he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was ; but now , when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile , he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark , and maybe was old leviticus himself .
jim cleaned up the canoe , and i got my paddle ready .
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point , about three mile above the townbeen there a couple of hours , taking on freight .
says the king : seein' how i'm dressed , i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st .
louis or cincinnati , or some other big place .
go for the steamboat , huckleberry ; we'll come down to the village on her .
i didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride .
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village , and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water .
pretty soon we come to a nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face , for it was powerful warm weather ; and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him .
run her nose in shore , says the king .
i done it .
wher' you bound for , young man ?
for the steamboat ; going to orleans .
git aboard , says the king .
hold on a minute , my servant 'll he'p you with them bags .
jump out and he'p the gentleman , adolphusmeaning me , i see .
i done so , and then we all three started on again .
the young chap was mighty thankful ; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather .
he asked the king where he was going , and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning , and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there .
the young fellow says : when i first see you i says to myself , 'it's mr. wilks , sure , and he come mighty near getting here in time .
'but then i says again , 'no , i reckon it ain't him , or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river .
'you ain't him , are you ?
no , my name's blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexander blodgett , i s'pose i must say , as i'm one o' the lord's poor servants .
but still i'm jist as able to be sorry for mr. wilks for not arriving in time , all the same , if he's missed anything by itwhich i hope he hasn't .
well , he don't miss any property by it , because he'll get that all right ; but he's missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he mayn't mind , nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died ; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ; hadn't seen him since they was boys togetherand hadn't ever seen his brother william at allthat's the deef and dumb onewilliam ain't more than thirty or thirtyfive .
peter and george were the only ones that come out here ; george was the married brother ; him and his wife both died last year .
harvey and william's the only ones that's left now ; and , as i was saying , they haven't got here in time .
did anybody send 'em word ?
oh , yes ; a month or two ago , when peter was first took ; because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time .
you see , he was pretty old , and george's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him , except mary jane , the redheaded one ; and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died , and didn't seem to care much to live .
he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william , too , for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will .
he left a letter behind for harvey , and said he'd told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so george's g'yirls would be all rightfor george didn't leave nothing .
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to .
why do you reckon harvey don't come ?
wher' does he live ?
oh , he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasn't ever been in this country .
he hasn't had any too much timeand besides he mightn't a got the letter at all , you know .
too bad , too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers , poor soul .
you going to orleans , you say ?
yes , but that ain't only a part of it .
i'm going in a ship , next wednesday , for ryo janeero , where my uncle lives .
it's a pretty long journey .
but it'll be lovely ; wisht i was agoing .
is mary jane the oldest ?
how old is the others ?
mary jane's nineteen , susan's fifteen , and joanna's about fourteenthat's the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip .
poor things !
to be left alone in the cold world so .
well , they could be worse off .
old peter had friends , and they ain't going to let them come to no harm .
there's hobson , the babtis' preacher ; and deacon lot hovey , and ben rucker , and abner shackleford , and levi bell , the lawyer ; and dr .
robinson , and their wives , and the widow bartley , andwell , there's a lot of them ; but these are the ones that peter was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home ; so harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here .
well , the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow .
blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town , and all about the wilkses ; and about peter's businesswhich was a tanner ; and about george'swhich was a carpenter ; and about harvey'swhich was a dissentering minister ; and so on , and so on .
then he says : what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for ?
because she's a big orleans boat , and i was afeard she mightn't stop there .
when they're deep they won't stop for a hail .
a cincinnati boat will , but this is a st .
louis one .
was peter wilks well off ?
oh , yes , pretty well off .
he had houses and land , and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers .
when did you say he died ?
i didn't say , but it was last night .
funeral tomorrow , likely ?
yes , 'bout the middle of the day .
well , it's all terrible sad ; but we've all got to go , one time or another .
so what we want to do is to be prepared ; then we're all right .
yes , sir , it's the best way .
ma used to always say that .
when we struck the boat she was about done loading , and pretty soon she got off .
the king never said nothing about going aboard , so i lost my ride , after all .
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place , and then he got ashore and says : now hustle back , right off , and fetch the duke up here , and the new carpetbags .
and if he's gone over to t'other side , go over there and git him .
and tell him to git himself up regardless .
shove along , now .
i see what he was up to ; but i never said nothing , of course .
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe , and then they set down on a log , and the king told him everything , just like the young fellow had said itevery last word of it .
and all the time he was adoing it he tried to talk like an englishman ; and he done it pretty well , too , for a slouch .
i can't imitate him , and so i ain't agoing to try to ; but he really done it pretty good .
then he says : how are you on the deef and dumb , bilgewater ?
the duke said , leave him alone for that ; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards .
so then they waited for a steamboat .
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they didn't come from high enough up the river ; but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her .
she sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from cincinnati ; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they wouldn't land us .
but the king was ca'm .
he says : if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em , can't it ?
so they softened down and said it was all right ; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore .
about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl acoming , and when the king says : kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' mr. peter wilks lives ?
they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , what d' i tell you ?
then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : i'm sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening .
sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash , and fell up against the man , and put his chin on his shoulder , and cried down his back , and says : alas , alas , our poor brothergone , and we never got to see him ; oh , it's too , too hard !
then he turns around , blubbering , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands , and blamed if he didn't drop a carpetbag and bust out acrying .
if they warn't the beatenest lot , them two frauds , that ever i struck .
well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them , and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them , and let them lean on them and cry , and told the king all about his brother's last moments , and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke , and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples .
well , if ever i struck anything like it , i'm a nigger .
it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race .
the news was all over town in two minutes , and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way , some of them putting on their coats as they come .
pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd , and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march .
the windows and dooryards was full ; and every minute somebody would say , over a fence : is it them ?
and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say : you bet it is .
when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed , and the three girls was standing in the door .
mary jane was redheaded , but that don't make no difference , she was most awful beautiful , and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory , she was so glad her uncles was come .
the king he spread his arms , and mary jane she jumped for them , and the harelip jumped for the duke , and there they had it !
everybody most , leastways women , cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times .
then the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then he looked around and see the coffin , over in the corner on two chairs ; so then him and the duke , with a hand across each other's shoulder , and t'other hand to their eyes , walked slow and solemn over there , everybody dropping back to give them room , and all the talk and noise stopping , people saying sh !
and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads , so you could a heard a pin fall .
and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin , and took one sight , and then they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans , most ; and then they put their arms around each other's necks , and hung their chins over each other's shoulders ; and then for three minutes , or maybe four , i never see two men leak the way they done .
and , mind you , everybody was doing the same ; and the place was that damp i never see anything like it .
then one of them got on one side of the coffin , and t'other on t'other side , and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin , and let on to pray all to themselves .
well , when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it , and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls , too ; and every woman , nearly , went up to the girls , without saying a word , and kissed them , solemn , on the forehead , and then put their hand on their head , and looked up towards the sky , with the tears running down , and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing , and give the next woman a show .
i never see anything so disgusting .
well , by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little , and works himself up and slobbers out a speech , all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased , and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile , but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears , and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart , because out of their mouths they can't , words being too weak and cold , and all that kind of rot and slush , till it was just sickening ; and then he blubbers out a pious goodygoody amen , and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust .
and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer , and everybody joined in with all their might , and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out .
music is a good thing ; and after all that soulbutter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so , and sound so honest and bully .
then the king begins to work his jaw again , and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening , and help set up with the ashes of the diseased ; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name , for they was names that was very dear to him , and mentioned often in his letters ; and so he will name the same , to wit , as follows , vizz .
 :rev .
mr. hobson , and deacon lot hovey , and mr. ben rucker , and abner shackleford , and levi bell , and dr .
robinson , and their wives , and the widow bartley .
rev .
hobson and dr .
robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting togetherthat is , i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world , and the preacher was pinting him right .
lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business .
but the rest was on hand , and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him ; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing , but just kept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time , like a baby that can't talk .
so the king he blattered along , and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town , by his name , and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town , or to george's family , or to peter .
and he always let on that peter wrote him the things ; but that was a lie : he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat .
then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind , and the king he read it out loud and cried over it .
it give the dwellinghouse and three thousand dollars , gold , to the girls ; and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business , along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand , and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william , and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar .
so these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up , and have everything square and aboveboard ; and told me to come with a candle .
we shut the cellar door behind us , and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor , and it was a lovely sight , all them yallerboys .
my , the way the king's eyes did shine !
he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says : oh , this ain't bully nor noth'n !
oh , no , i reckon not !
why , bully , it beats the nonesuch , don't it ?
the duke allowed it did .
they pawed the yallerboys , and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor ; and the king says : it ain't no use talkin' ; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and me , bilge .
thish yer comes of trust'n to providence .
it's the best way , in the long run .
i've tried 'em all , and ther' ain't no better way .
most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile , and took it on trust ; but no , they must count it .
so they counts it , and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short .
says the king : dern him , i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars ?
they worried over that awhile , and ransacked all around for it .
then the duke says : well , he was a pretty sick man , and likely he made a mistakei reckon that's the way of it .
the best way's to let it go , and keep still about it .
we can spare it .
oh , shucks , yes , we can spare it .
i don't k'yer noth'n 'bout thatit's the count i'm thinkin' about .
we want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here , you know .
we want to lug this hyer money up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther' ain't noth'n suspicious .
but when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars , you know , we don't want to hold on , says the duke .
le's make up the deffisit , and he begun to haul out yallerboys out of his pocket .
it's a most amaz'n' good idea , dukeyou have got a rattlin' clever head on you , says the king .
blest if the old nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin , and he begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up .
it most busted them , but they made up the six thousand clean and clear .
say , says the duke , i got another idea .
le's go up stairs and count this money , and then take and give it to the girls .
good land , duke , lemme hug you !
it's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck .
you have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head i ever see .
oh , this is the boss dodge , ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it .
let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis 'll lay 'em out .
when we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table , and the king he counted it and stacked it up , three hundred dollars in a piletwenty elegant little piles .
everybody looked hungry at it , and licked their chops .
then they raked it into the bag again , and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech .
he says : friends all , my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers .
he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered , and that's left fatherless and motherless .
yes , and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear william and me .
now , wouldn't he ?
ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind .
well , then , what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time ?
and what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd robyes , robsech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time ?
if i know williamand i think i dohewell , i'll jest ask him .
he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands , and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while ; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning , and jumps for the king , googooing with all his might for joy , and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up .
then the king says , i knowed it ; i reckon that 'll convince anybody the way he feels about it .
here , mary jane , susan , joanner , take the moneytake it all .
it's the gift of him that lays yonder , cold but joyful .
mary jane she went for him , susan and the harelip went for the duke , and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet .
and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes , and most shook the hands off of them frauds , saying all the time : you dear good souls !
howlovely !
howcould you !
well , then , pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again , and how good he was , and what a loss he was , and all that ; and before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside , and stood alistening and looking , and not saying anything ; and nobody saying anything to him either , because the king was talking and they was all busy listening .
the king was sayingin the middle of something he'd started in on they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased .
that's why they're invited here this evenin' ; but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybody ; for he respected everybody , he liked everybody , and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public .
and so he went amooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he couldn't stand it no more ; so he writes on a little scrap of paper , obsequies , you old fool , and folds it up , and goes to googooing and reaching it over people's heads to him .
the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : poor william , afflicted as he is , his heart's aluz right .
asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make 'em all welcome .
but he needn't a worriedit was jest what i was at .
then he weaves along again , perfectly ca'm , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before .
and when he done it the third time he says : i say orgies , not because it's the common term , because it ain'tobsequies bein' the common termbut because orgies is the right term .
obsequies ain't used in england no more nowit's gone out .
we say orgies now in england .
orgies is better , because it means the thing you're after more exact .
it's a word that's made up out'n the greek orgo , outside , open , abroad ; and the hebrew jeesum , to plant , cover up ; hence inter .
so , you see , funeral orgies is an open er public funeral .
he was the worst i ever struck .
well , the ironjawed man he laughed right in his face .
everybody was shocked .
everybody says , why , doctor !
and abner shackleford says : why , robinson , hain't you heard the news ?
this is harvey wilks .
the king he smiled eager , and shoved out his flapper , and says : is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician ?
i keep your hands off of me !
says the doctor .
you talk like an englishman , don't you ?
it's the worst imitation i ever heard .
you peter wilks's brother !
you're a fraud , that's what you are !
well , how they all took on !
they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he was harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and begged him not to hurt harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings , and all that .
but it warn't no use ; he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar .
the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them .
he says : i was your father's friend , and i'm your friend ; and i warn you as a friend , and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble , to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him , the ignorant tramp , with his idiotic greek and hebrew , as he calls it .
he is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres , and you take them for proofs , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here , who ought to know better .
mary jane wilks , you know me for your friend , and for your unselfish friend , too .
now listen to me ; turn this pitiful rascal outi beg you to do it .
will you ?
mary jane straightened herself up , and my , but she was handsome !
she says : here is my answer .
she hove up the bag of money and put it in the king's hands , and says , take this six thousand dollars , and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to , and don't give us no receipt for it .
then she put her arm around the king on one side , and susan and the harelip done the same on the other .
everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm , whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud .
the doctor says : all right ; i wash my hands of the matter .
but i warn you all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day .
and away he went .
all right , doctor , says the king , kinder mocking him ; we'll try and get 'em to send for you ; which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit .
well , when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for uncle william , and she'd give her own room to uncle harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it .
the king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me .
so mary jane took us up , and she showed them their rooms , which was plain but nice .
she said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harvey's way , but he said they warn't .
the frocks was hung along the wall , and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor .
there was an old hair trunk in one corner , and a guitarbox in another , and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around , like girls brisken up a room with .
the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings , and so don't disturb them .
the duke's room was pretty small , but plenty good enough , and so was my cubby .
that night they had a big supper , and all them men and women was there , and i stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them , and the niggers waited on the rest .
mary jane she set at the head of the table , with susan alongside of her , and said how bad the biscuits was , and how mean the preserves was , and how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind of rot , the way women always do for to force out compliments ; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop , and said sosaid how do you get biscuits to brown so nice ?
and where , for the land's sake , did you get these amaz'n pickles ?
and all that kind of humbug talkytalk , just the way people always does at a supper , you know .
and when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things .
the harelip she got to pumping me about england , and blest if i didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes .
she says : did you ever see the king ?
who ?
william fourth ?
well , i bet i havehe goes to our church .
i knowed he was dead years ago , but i never let on .
so when i says he goes to our church , she says : whatregular ?
yesregular .
his pew's right over opposite ournon t'other side the pulpit .
i thought he lived in london ?
well , he does .
where would he live ?
but i thought you lived in sheffield ?
i see i was up a stump .
i had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again .
then i says : i mean he goes to our church regular when he's in sheffield .
that's only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths .
why , how you talksheffield ain't on the sea .
well , who said it was ?
why , you did .
i didn't nuther .
you did !
i didn't .
you did .
i never said nothing of the kind .
well , what did you say , then ?
said he come to take the sea bathsthat's what i said .
well , then , how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea ?
looky here , i says ; did you ever see any congresswater ?
yes .
well , did you have to go to congress to get it ?
why , no .
well , neither does william fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath .
how does he get it , then ?
gets it the way people down here gets congresswaterin barrels .
there in the palace at sheffield they've got furnaces , and he wants his water hot .
they can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea .
they haven't got no conveniences for it .
oh , i see , now .
you might a said that in the first place and saved time .
when she said that i see i was out of the woods again , and so i was comfortable and glad .
next , she says : do you go to church , too ?
yesregular .
where do you set ?
why , in our pew .
whose pew ?
why , ournyour uncle harvey's .
his'n ?
what does he want with a pew ?
wants it to set in .
what did you reckon he wanted with it ?
why , i thought he'd be in the pulpit .
rot him , i forgot he was a preacher .
i see i was up a stump again , so i played another chicken bone and got another think .
then i says : blame it , do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church ?
why , what do they want with more ?
what !
topreach before a king ?
i never did see such a girl as you .
they don't have no less than seventeen .
seventeen !
my land !
why , i wouldn't set out such a string as that , not if i never got to glory .
it must take 'em a week .
shucks , they don't all of 'em preach the same dayonly one of 'em .
well , then , what does the rest of 'em do ?
oh , nothing much .
loll around , pass the plateand one thing or another .
but mainly they don't do nothing .
well , then , what are they for ?
why , they're for style .
don't you know nothing ?
well , i don't want to know no such foolishness as that .
how is servants treated in england ?
do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers ?
no !
a servant ain't nobody there .
they treat them worse than dogs .
don't they give 'em holidays , the way we do , christmas and new year's week , and fourth of july ?
oh , just listen !
a body could tell you hain't ever been to england by that .
why , harelwhy , joanna , they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end ; never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres .
nor church ?
nor church .
but you always went to church .
well , i was gone up again .
i forgot i was the old man's servant .
but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not , and set with the family , on account of its being the law .
but i didn't do it pretty good , and when i got done i see she warn't satisfied .
she says : honest injun , now , hain't you been telling me a lot of lies ?
honest injun , says i .
none of it at all ?
none of it at all .
not a lie in it , says i .
lay your hand on this book and say it .
i see it warn't nothing but a dictionary , so i laid my hand on it and said it .
so then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : well , then , i'll believe some of it ; but i hope to gracious if i'll believe the rest .
what is it you won't believe , joe ?
says mary jane , stepping in with susan behind her .
it ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people .
how would you like to be treated so ?
that's always your way , maimalways sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt .
i hain't done nothing to him .
he's told some stretchers , i reckon , and i said i wouldn't swallow it all ; and that's every bit and grain i did say .
i reckon he can stand a little thing like that , can't he ?
i don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big ; he's here in our house and a stranger , and it wasn't good of you to say it .
if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed .
why , mam , he said it don't make no difference what he saidthat ain't the thing .
the thing is for you to treat him kind , and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks .
i says to myself , this is a girl that i'm letting that old reptile rob her of her money !
then susan she waltzed in ; and if you'll believe me , she did give harelip hark from the tomb !
says i to myself , and this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money !
then mary jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely againwhich was her way ; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor harelip .
so she hollered .
all right , then , says the other girls ; you just ask his pardon .
she done it , too ; and she done it beautiful .
she done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again .
i says to myself , this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money .
and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends .
i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself , my mind's made up ; i'll hive that money for them or bust .
so then i lit outfor bed , i said , meaning some time or another .
when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over .
i says to myself , shall i go to that doctor , private , and blow on these frauds ?
nothat won't do .
he might tell who told him ; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me .
shall i go , private , and tell mary jane ?
noi dasn't do it .
her face would give them a hint , sure ; they've got the money , and they'd slide right out and get away with it .
if she was to fetch in help i'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with , i judge .
no ; there ain't no good way but one .
i got to steal that money , somehow ; and i got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that i done it .
they've got a good thing here , and they ain't agoing to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth , so i'll find a chance time enough .
i'll steal it and hide it ; and by and by , when i'm away down the river , i'll write a letter and tell mary jane where it's hid .
but i better hive it tonight if i can , because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has ; he might scare them out of here yet .
so , thinks i , i'll go and search them rooms .
upstairs the hall was dark , but i found the duke's room , and started to paw around it with my hands ; but i recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ; so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there .
but i see i couldn't do nothing without a candle , and i dasn't light one , of course .
so i judged i'd got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop .
about that time i hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed ; i reached for it , but it wasn't where i thought it would be ; but i touched the curtain that hid mary jane's frocks , so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still .
they come in and shut the door ; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed .
then i was glad i hadn't found the bed when i wanted it .
and yet , you know , it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private .
they sets down then , and the king says : well , what is it ?
and cut it middlin' short , because it's better for us to be down there awhoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over .
well , this is it , capet .
i ain't easy ; i ain't comfortable .
that doctor lays on my mind .
i wanted to know your plans .
i've got a notion , and i think it's a sound one .
what is it , duke ?
that we better glide out of this before three in the morning , and clip it down the river with what we've got .
specially , seeing we got it so easygiven back to us , flung at our heads , as you may say , when of course we allowed to have to steal it back .
i'm for knocking off and lighting out .
that made me feel pretty bad .
about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different , but now it made me feel bad and disappointed , the king rips out and says : what !
and not sell out the rest o' the property ?
march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in ?
andall good , salable stuff , too .
the duke he grumbled ; said the bag of gold was enough , and he didn't want to go no deeperdidn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had .
why , how you talk !
says the king .
we sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money .
the people that buys the property is the suff'rers ; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own itwhich won't be long after we've slidthe sale won't be valid , and it 'll all go back to the estate .
these yer orphans 'll git their house back agin , and that's enough for them ; they're young and spry , and k'n easy earn a livin' .
they ain't agoin to suffer .
why , jest thinkthere's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off .
bless you , they ain't got noth'n' to complain of .
well , the king he talked him blind ; so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them .
but the king says : cuss the doctor !
what do we k'yer for him ?
hain't we got all the fools in town on our side ?
and ain't that a big enough majority in any town ?
so they got ready to go down stairs again .
the duke says : i don't think we put that money in a good place .
that cheered me up .
i'd begun to think i warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me .
the king says : why ?
because mary jane 'll be in mourning from this out ; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away ; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it ?
your head's level agin , duke , says the king ; and he comes afumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was .
i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still , though quivery ; and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me ; and i tried to think what i'd better do if they did catch me .
but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought , and he never suspicioned i was around .
they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed , and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now , because a nigger only makes up the featherbed , and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year , and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now .
but i knowed better .
i had it out of there before they was halfway down stairs .
i groped along up to my cubby , and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better .
i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres , because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking : i knowed that very well .
then i turned in , with my clothes all on ; but i couldn't a gone to sleep if i'd a wanted to , i was in such a sweat to get through with the business .
by and by i heard the king and the duke come up ; so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen .
but nothing did .
so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet ; and then i slipped down the ladder .
i crept to their doors and listened ; they was snoring .
so i tiptoed along , and got down stairs all right .
there warn't a sound anywheres .
i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door , and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs .
the door was open into the parlor , where the corpse was laying , and there was a candle in both rooms .
i passed along , and the parlor door was open ; but i see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of peter ; so i shoved on by ; but the front door was locked , and the key wasn't there .
just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs , back behind me .
i run in the parlor and took a swift look around , and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin .
the lid was shoved along about a foot , showing the dead man's face down in there , with a wet cloth over it , and his shroud on .
i tucked the moneybag in under the lid , just down beyond where his hands was crossed , which made me creep , they was so cold , and then i run back across the room and in behind the door .
the person coming was mary jane .
she went to the coffin , very soft , and kneeled down and looked in ; then she put up her handkerchief , and i see she begun to cry , though i couldn't hear her , and her back was to me .
i slid out , and as i passed the diningroom i thought i'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me ; so i looked through the crack , and everything was all right .
they hadn't stirred .
i slipped up to bed , feeling ruther blue , on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it .
says i , if it could stay where it is , all right ; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane , and she could dig him up again and get it ; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen ; the thing that's going to happen is , the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid .
then the king 'll get it again , and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him .
of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there , but i dasn't try it .
every minute it was getting earlier now , and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir , and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of .
i don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that , i says to myself .
when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up , and the watchers was gone .
there warn't nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe .
i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening , but i couldn't tell .
towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man , and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs , and then set all our chairs in rows , and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full .
i see the coffin lid was the way it was before , but i dasn't go to look in under it , with folks around .
then the people begun to flock in , and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin , and for a half an hour the people filed around slow , in single rank , and looked down at the dead man's face a minute , and some dropped in a tear , and it was all very still and solemn , only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent , and sobbing a little .
there warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church .
when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways , putting on the last touches , and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable , and making no more sound than a cat .
he never spoke ; he moved people around , he squeezed in late ones , he opened up passageways , and done it with nods , and signs with his hands .
then he took his place over against the wall .
he was the softest , glidingest , stealthiest man i ever see ; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham .
they had borrowed a melodeuma sick one ; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it , and it was pretty skreeky and colicky , and everybody joined in and sung , and peter was the only one that had a good thing , according to my notion .
then the reverend hobson opened up , slow and solemn , and begun to talk ; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ; it was only one dog , but he made a most powerful racket , and he kept it up right along ; the parson he had to stand there , over the coffin , and waityou couldn't hear yourself think .
it was right down awkward , and nobody didn't seem to know what to do .
but pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say , don't you worryjust depend on me .
then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall , just his shoulders showing over the people's heads .
so he glided along , and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ; and at last , when he had gone around two sides of the room , he disappears down cellar .
then in about two seconds we heard a whack , and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two , and then everything was dead still , and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off .
in a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room , and then rose up , and shaded his mouth with his hands , and stretched his neck out towards the preacher , over the people's heads , and says , in a kind of a coarse whisper , he had a rat !
then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place .
you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people , because naturally they wanted to know .
a little thing like that don't cost nothing , and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked .
there warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was .
well , the funeral sermon was very good , but pison long and tiresome ; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage , and at last the job was through , and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver .
i was in a sweat then , and watched him pretty keen .
but he never meddled at all ; just slid the lid along as soft as mush , and screwed it down tight and fast .
so there i was !
i didn't know whether the money was in there or not .
so , says i , s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly ?
nowhow do i know whether to write to mary jane or not ?
s'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing , what would she think of me ?
blame it , i says , i might get hunted up and jailed ; i'd better lay low and keep dark , and not write at all ; the thing's awful mixed now ; trying to better it , i've worsened it a hundred times , and i wish to goodness i'd just let it alone , dad fetch the whole business !
they buried him , and we come back home , and i went to watching faces againi couldn't help it , and i couldn't rest easy .
but nothing come of it ; the faces didn't tell me nothing .
the king he visited around in the evening , and sweetened everybody up , and made himself ever so friendly ; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him , so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home .
he was very sorry he was so pushed , and so was everybody ; they wished he could stay longer , but they said they could see it couldn't be done .
and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them ; and that pleased everybody too , because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations ; and it pleased the girls , tootickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world ; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to , they would be ready .
them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so , but i didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune .
well , blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral ; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to .
so the next day after the funeral , along about noontime , the girls' joy got the first jolt .
a couple of nigger traders come along , and the king sold them the niggers reasonable , for threeday drafts as they called it , and away they went , the two sons up the river to memphis , and their mother down the river to orleans .
i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ; they cried around each other , and took on so it most made me down sick to see it .
the girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town .
i can't ever get it out of my memory , the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying ; and i reckon i couldn't a stood it all , but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two .
the thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way .
it injured the frauds some ; but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy .
next day was auction day .
about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up , and i see by their look that there was trouble .
the king says : was you in my room night before last ?
no , your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warn't around .
was you in there yisterday er last night ?
no , your majesty .
honor bright , nowno lies .
honor bright , your majesty , i'm telling you the truth .
i hain't been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you .
the duke says : have you seen anybody else go in there ?
no , your grace , not as i remember , i believe .
stop and think .
i studied awhile and see my chance ; then i says : well , i see the niggers go in there several times .
both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they hadn't ever expected it , and then like they had .
then the duke says : what , all of them ?
noleastways , not all at oncethat is , i don't think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time .
hello !
when was that ?
it was the day we had the funeral .
in the morning .
it warn't early , because i overslept .
i was just starting down the ladder , and i see them .
well , go on , go on !
what did they do ?
how'd they act ?
they didn't do nothing .
and they didn't act anyway much , as fur as i see .
they tiptoed away ; so i seen , easy enough , that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room , or something , s'posing you was up ; and found you warn't up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they hadn't already waked you up .
great guns , this is a go !
says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly .
they stood there athinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand .
they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region !
and i believed they was sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody .
don't ever tell me any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent .
why , the way they played that thing it would fool anybody .
in my opinion , there's a fortune in 'em .
if i had capital and a theater , i wouldn't want a better layout than thatand here we've gone and sold 'em for a song .
yes , and ain't privileged to sing the song yet .
say , where is that songthat draft ?
in the bank for to be collected .
where would it be ?
well , that's all right then , thank goodness .
says i , kind of timidlike : is something gone wrong ?
the king whirls on me and rips out : none o' your business !
you keep your head shet , and mind y'r own affairsif you got any .
long as you're in this town don't you forgit thatyou hear ?
then he says to the duke , we got to jest swaller it and say noth'n' : mum's the word for us .
as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : quick sales and small profits !
it's a good businessyes .
the king snarls around on him and says : i was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick .
if the profits has turned out to be none , lackin' considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more'n it's yourn ?
well , they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if i could a got my advice listened to .
the king sassed back as much as was safe for him , and then swapped around and lit into me again .
he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up .
and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile , and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning , and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again .
so they went off ajawing ; and i felt dreadful glad i'd worked it all off on to the niggers , and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it .
by and by it was gettingup time .
so i come down the ladder and started for downstairs ; but as i come to the girls' room the door was open , and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she'd been packing things in itgetting ready to go to england .
but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying .
i felt awful bad to see it ; of course anybody would .
i went in there and says : miss mary jane , you can't abear to see people in trouble , and i can'tmost always .
tell me about it .
so she done it .
and it was the niggersi just expected it .
she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her ; she didn't know how she was ever going to be happy there , knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever , and flung up her hands , and says : oh , dear , dear , to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more !
but they willand inside of two weeksand i know it !
says i .
laws , it was out before i could think !
and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again , say it again , say it again !
i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much , and was in a close place .
i asked her to let me think a minute ; and she set there , very impatient and excited and handsome , but looking kind of happy and easedup , like a person that's had a tooth pulled out .
so i went to studying it out .
i says to myself , i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though i ain't had no experience , and can't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here's a case where i'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie .
i must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it's so kind of strange and unregular .
i never see nothing like it .
well , i says to myself at last , i'm agoing to chance it ; i'll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to .
then i says : miss mary jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days ?
yes ; mr. lothrop's .
why ?
never mind why yet .
if i'll tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand prove how i know itwill you go to mr. lothrop's and stay four days ?
four days !
she says ; i'll stay a year !
all right , i says , i don't want nothing more out of you than just your wordi druther have it than another man's kissthebible .
she smiled and reddened up very sweet , and i says , if you don't mind it , i'll shut the doorand bolt it .
then i come back and set down again , and says : don't you holler .
just set still and take it like a man .
i got to tell the truth , and you want to brace up , miss mary , because it's a bad kind , and going to be hard to take , but there ain't no help for it .
these uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all ; they're a couple of fraudsregular deadbeats .
there , now we're over the worst of it , you can stand the rest middling easy .
it jolted her up like everything , of course ; but i was over the shoal water now , so i went right along , her eyes ablazing higher and higher all the time , and told her every blame thing , from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat , clear through to where she flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps , with her face afire like sunset , and says : the brute !
come , don't waste a minutenot a secondwe'll have them tarred and feathered , and flung in the river !
says i : cert'nly .
but do you mean before you go to mr. lothrop's , or oh , she says , what am i thinking about !
she says , and set right down again .
don't mind what i saidplease don'tyou won't , now , will you ?
laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first .
i never thought , i was so stirred up , she says ; now go on , and i won't do so any more .
you tell me what to do , and whatever you say i'll do it .
well , i says , it's a rough gang , them two frauds , and i'm fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer , whether i want to or noti druther not tell you why ; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws , and i'd be all right ; but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble .
well , we got to save him , hain't we ?
of course .
well , then , we won't blow on them .
saying them words put a good idea in my head .
i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds ; get them jailed here , and then leave .
but i didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ; so i didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight .
i says : miss mary jane , i'll tell you what we'll do , and you won't have to stay at mr. lothrop's so long , nuther .
how fur is it ?
a little short of four milesright out in the country , back here .
well , that 'll answer .
now you go along out there , and lay low till nine or halfpast tonight , and then get them to fetch you home againtell them you've thought of something .
if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window , and if i don't turn up wait till eleven , and then if i don't turn up it means i'm gone , and out of the way , and safe .
then you come out and spread the news around , and get these beats jailed .
good , she says , i'll do it .
and if it just happens so that i don't get away , but get took up along with them , you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand , and you must stand by me all you can .
stand by you !
indeed i will .
they sha'n't touch a hair of your head !
she says , and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it , too .
if i get away i sha'n't be here , i says , to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles , and i couldn't do it if i was here .
i could swear they was beats and bummers , that's all , though that's worth something .
well , there's others can do that better than what i can , and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as i'd be .
i'll tell you how to find them .
gimme a pencil and a piece of paper .
there'royal nonesuch , bricksville .
'put it away , and don't lose it .
when the court wants to find out something about these two , let them send up to bricksville and say they've got the men that played the royal nonesuch , and ask for some witnesseswhy , you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink , miss mary .
and they'll come abiling , too .
i judged we had got everything fixed about right now .
so i says : just let the auction go right along , and don't worry .
nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice , and they ain't going out of this till they get that money ; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count , and they ain't going to get no money .
it's just like the way it was with the niggersit warn't no sale , and the niggers will be back before long .
why , they can't collect the money for the niggers yetthey're in the worst kind of a fix , miss mary .
well , she says , i'll run down to breakfast now , and then i'll start straight for mr. lothrop's .
'deed , that ain't the ticket , miss mary jane , i says , by no manner of means ; go before breakfast .
why ?
what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for , miss mary ?
well , i never thoughtand come to think , i don't know .
what was it ?
why , it's because you ain't one of these leatherface people .
i don't want no better book than what your face is .
a body can set down and read it off like coarse print .
do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you goodmorning , and never there , there , don't !
yes , i'll go before breakfasti'll be glad to .
and leave my sisters with them ?
yes ; never mind about them .
they've got to stand it yet a while .
they might suspicion something if all of you was to go .
i don't want you to see them , nor your sisters , nor nobody in this town ; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something .
no , you go right along , miss mary jane , and i'll fix it with all of them .
i'll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change , or to see a friend , and you'll be back tonight or early in the morning .
gone to see a friend is all right , but i won't have my love given to them .
well , then , it sha'n't be .
it was well enough to tell her sono harm in it .
it was only a little thing to do , and no trouble ; and it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most , down here below ; it would make mary jane comfortable , and it wouldn't cost nothing .
then i says : there's one more thingthat bag of money .
well , they've got that ; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it .
no , you're out , there .
they hain't got it .
why , who's got it ?
i wish i knowed , but i don't .
i had it , because i stole it from them ; and i stole it to give to you ; and i know where i hid it , but i'm afraid it ain't there no more .
i'm awful sorry , miss mary jane , i'm just as sorry as i can be ; but i done the best i could ; i did honest .
i come nigh getting caught , and i had to shove it into the first place i come to , and runand it warn't a good place .
oh , stop blaming yourselfit's too bad to do it , and i won't allow ityou couldn't help it ; it wasn't your fault .
where did you hide it ?
i didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ; and i couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach .
so for a minute i didn't say nothing ; then i says : i'd ruther not tell you where i put it , miss mary jane , if you don't mind letting me off ; but i'll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to mr. lothrop's , if you want to .
do you reckon that 'll do ?
oh , yes .
so i wrote : i put it in the coffin .
it was in there when you was crying there , away in the night .
i was behind the door , and i was mighty sorry for you , miss mary jane .
it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : goodbye .
i'm going to do everything just as you've told me ; and if i don't ever see you again , i sha'n't ever forget you and i'll think of you a many and a many a time , and i'll pray for you , too !
andshe was gone .
pray for me !
i reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size .
but i bet she done it , just the sameshe was just that kind .
she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notionthere warn't no backdown to her , i judge .
you may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand .
it sounds like flattery , but it ain't no flattery .
and when it comes to beautyand goodness , tooshe lays over them all .
i hain't ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door ; no , i hain't ever seen her since , but i reckon i've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever i'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her , blamed if i wouldn't a done it or bust .
well , mary jane she lit out the back way , i reckon ; because nobody see her go .
when i struck susan and the harelip , i says : what's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes ?
they says : there's several ; but it's the proctors , mainly .
that's the name , i says ; i most forgot it .
well , miss mary jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of them's sick .
which one ?
i don't know ; leastways , i kinder forget ; but i thinks it's sakes alive , i hope it ain't hanner ?
i'm sorry to say it , i says , but hanner's the very one .
my goodness , and she so well only last week !
is she took bad ?
it ain't no name for it .
they set up with her all night , miss mary jane said , and they don't think she'll last many hours .
only think of that , now !
what's the matter with her ?
i couldn't think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so i says : mumps .
mumps your granny !
they don't set up with people that's got the mumps .
they don't , don't they ?
you better bet they do with these mumps .
these mumps is different .
it's a new kind , miss mary jane said .
how's it a new kind ?
because it's mixed up with other things .
what other things ?
well , measles , and whoopingcough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brainfever , and i don't know what all .
my land !
and they call it the mumps ?
that's what miss mary jane said .
well , what in the nation do they call it the mumps for ?
why , because it is the mumps .
that's what it starts with .
well , ther' ain't no sense in it .
a body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , 'why , he stumped his toe .
'would ther' be any sense in that ?
no .
and ther' ain't no sense in this , nuther .
is it ketching ?
is it ketching ?
why , how you talk .
is a harrow catchingin the dark ?
if you don't hitch on to one tooth , you're bound to on another , ain't you ?
and you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along , can you ?
well , these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow , as you may sayand it ain't no slouch of a harrow , nuther , you come to get it hitched on good .
well , it's awful , i think , says the harelip .
i'll go to uncle harvey and oh , yes , i says , i would .
of course i would .
i wouldn't lose no time .
well , why wouldn't you ?
just look at it a minute , and maybe you can see .
hain't your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can ?
and do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves ?
you know they'll wait for you .
so fur , so good .
your uncle harvey's a preacher , ain't he ?
very well , then ; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk ?
is he going to deceive a ship clerk ?
soas to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard ?
now you know he ain't .
what will he do , then ?
why , he'll say , 'it's a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps , and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it .
'but never mind , if you think it's best to tell your uncle harvey shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary jane's got it or not ?
why , you talk like a muggins .
well , anyway , maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors .
listen at that , now .
you do beat all for natural stupidness .
can't you see that they'd go and tell ?
ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at all .
well , maybe you're rightyes , i judge you are right .
but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey she's gone out a while , anyway , so he won't be uneasy about her ?
yes , miss mary jane she wanted you to do that .
she says , 'tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss , and say i've run over the river to see mr .
'mr .
whatis the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much of ?
imean the one that why , you must mean the apthorps , ain't it ?
of course ; bother them kind of names , a body can't ever seem to remember them , half the time , somehow .
yes , she said , say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house , because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else ; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come , and then , if she ain't too tired , she's coming home ; and if she is , she'll be home in the morning anyway .
she said , don't say nothing about the proctors , but only about the apthorpswhich 'll be perfectly true , because she is going there to speak about their buying the house ; i know it , because she told me so herself .
all right , they said , and cleared out to lay for their uncles , and give them the love and the kisses , and tell them the message .
everything was all right now .
the girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to england ; and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson .
i felt very good ; i judged i had done it pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself .
of course he would a throwed more style into it , but i can't do that very handy , not being brung up to it .
well , they held the auction in the public square , along towards the end of the afternoon , and it strung along , and strung along , and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest , up there longside of the auctioneer , and chipping in a little scripture now and then , or a little goodygoody saying of some kind , and the duke he was around googooing for sympathy all he knowed how , and just spreading himself generly .
but by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was soldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
so they'd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything .
well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out : here's your opposition line !
here's your two sets o' heirs to old peter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice !
they was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along , and a nicelooking younger one , with his right arm in a sling .
and , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up .
but i didn't see no joke about it , and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any .
i reckoned they'd turn pale .
but no , nary a pale did they turn .
the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up , but just went a googooing around , happy and satisfied , like a jug that's googling out buttermilk ; and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world .
oh , he done it admirable .
lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side .
that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death .
pretty soon he begun to speak , and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishmannot the king's way , though the king's was pretty good for an imitation .
i can't give the old gent's words , nor i can't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : this is a surprise to me which i wasn't looking for ; and i'll acknowledge , candid and frank , i ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake .
i am peter wilks' brother harvey , and this is his brother william , which can't hear nor speakand can't even make signs to amount to much , now't he's only got one hand to work them with .
we are who we say we are ; and in a day or two , when i get the baggage , i can prove it .
but up till then i won't say nothing more , but go to the hotel and wait .
so him and the new dummy started off ; and the king he laughs , and blethers out : broke his armvery likely , ain't it ?
andvery convenient , too , for a fraud that's got to make signs , and ain't learnt how .
lost their baggage !
that's mighty good !
andmighty ingeniousunder the circumstances !
so he laughed again ; and so did everybody else , except three or four , or maybe half a dozen .
one of these was that doctor ; another one was a sharplooking gentleman , with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpetstuff , that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice , and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their headsit was levi bell , the lawyer that was gone up to louisville ; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said , and was listening to the king now .
and when the king got done this husky up and says : say , looky here ; if you are harvey wilks , when'd you come to this town ?
the day before the funeral , friend , says the king .
but what time o' day ?
in the evenin''bout an hour er two before sundown .
how'd you come ?
i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati .
well , then , how'd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin'in a canoe ?
i warn't up at the pint in the mornin' .
it's a lie .
several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher .
preacher be hanged , he's a fraud and a liar .
he was up at the pint that mornin' .
i live up there , don't i ?
well , i was up there , and he was up there .
i see him there .
he come in a canoe , along with tim collins and a boy .
the doctor he up and says : would you know the boy again if you was to see him , hines ?
i reckon i would , but i don't know .
why , yonder he is , now .
i know him perfectly easy .
it was me he pointed at .
the doctor says : neighbors , i don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not ; but if these two ain't frauds , i am an idiot , that's all .
i think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing .
come along , hines ; come along , the rest of you .
we'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple , and i reckon we'll find out something before we get through .
it was nuts for the crowd , though maybe not for the king's friends ; so we all started .
it was about sundown .
the doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand .
we all got in a big room in the hotel , and lit up some candles , and fetched in the new couple .
first , the doctor says : i don't wish to be too hard on these two men , but i think they're frauds , and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about .
if they have , won't the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left ?
it ain't unlikely .
if these men ain't frauds , they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all rightain't that so ?
everybody agreed to that .
so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart .
but the king he only looked sorrowful , and says : gentlemen , i wish the money was there , for i ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , outandout investigation o' this misable business ; but , alas , the money ain't there ; you k'n send and see , if you want to .
where is it , then ?
well , when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed , not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here , and considerin' the bed a safe place , we not bein' used to niggers , and suppos'n' 'em honest , like servants in england .
the niggers stole it the very next mornin' after i had went down stairs ; and when i sold 'em i hadn't missed the money yit , so they got clean away with it .
my servant here k'n tell you 'bout it , gentlemen .
the doctor and several said shucks !
and i see nobody didn't altogether believe him .
one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it .
i said no , but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away , and i never thought nothing , only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them .
that was all they asked me .
then the doctor whirls on me and says : are you english , too ?
i says yes ; and him and some others laughed , and said , stuff !
well , then they sailed in on the general investigation , and there we had it , up and down , hour in , hour out , and nobody never said a word about supper , nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up , and kept it up ; and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see .
they made the king tell his yarn , and they made the old gentleman tell his'n ; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies .
and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed .
the king he give me a lefthanded look out of the corner of his eye , and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side .
i begun to tell about sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the english wilkses , and so on ; but i didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and levi bell , the lawyer , says : set down , my boy ; i wouldn't strain myself if i was you .
i reckon you ain't used to lying , it don't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice .
you do it pretty awkward .
i didn't care nothing for the compliment , but i was glad to be let off , anyway .
the doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : if you'd been in town at first , levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : why , is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often about ?
the lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low ; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : that 'll fix it .
i'll take the order and send it , along with your brother's , and then they'll know it's all right .
so they got some paper and a pen , and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side , and chawed his tongue , and scrawled off something ; and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the duke looked sick .
but he took the pen and wrote .
so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says : you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names .
the old gentleman wrote , but nobody couldn't read it .
the lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : well , it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket , and examined them , and then examined the old man's writing , and then them again ; and then says : these old letters is from harvey wilks ; and here's these two handwritings , and anybody can see they didn't write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish , i tell you , to see how the lawyer had took them in , and here's this old gentleman's hand writing , and anybody can tell , easy enough , he didn't write themfact is , the scratches he makes ain't properly writing at all .
now , here's some letters from the new old gentleman says : if you please , let me explain .
nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me .
it's his hand you've got there , not mine .
well !
says the lawyer , this is a state of things .
i've got some of william's letters , too ; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can com he can't write with his left hand , says the old gentleman .
if he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too .
look at both , pleasethey're by the same hand .
the lawyer done it , and says : i believe it's soand if it ain't so , there's a heap stronger resemblance than i'd noticed before , anyway .
well , well , well !
i thought we was right on the track of a solution , but it's gone to grass , partly .
but anyway , one thing is provedthese two ain't either of 'em wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke .
well , what do you think ?
that muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then !
indeed he wouldn't .
said it warn't no fair test .
said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world , and hadn't tried to writehe see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper .
and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in , and says : i've thought of something .
is there anybody here that helped to lay out my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying ?
yes , says somebody , me and ab turner done it .
we're both here .
then the old man turns towards the king , and says : perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast ?
blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick , or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man ?
he whitened a little ; he couldn't help it ; and it was mighty still in there , and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him .
says i to myself , now he'll throw up the spongethere ain't no more use .
well , did he ?
a body can't hardly believe it , but he didn't .
i reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out , so they'd thin out , and him and the duke could break loose and get away .
anyway , he set there , and pretty soon he begun to smile , and says : mf !
it's a very tough question , ain't it !
yes , sir , i k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast .
it's jest a small , thin , blue arrowthat's what it is ; and if you don't look clost , you can't see it .
now what do you sayhey ?
well , i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout cheek .
the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard , and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time , and says : thereyou've heard what he said !
was there any such mark on peter wilks' breast ?
both of them spoke up and says : we didn't see no such mark .
good !
says the old gentleman .
now , what you did see on his breast was a small dim p , and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young , and a w , with dashes between them , so : pbwand he marked them that way on a piece of paper .
come , ain't that what you saw ?
both of them spoke up again , and says : no , we didn't .
we never seen any marks at all .
well , everybody was in a state of mind now , and they sings out : the whole bilin' of 'm 's frauds !
le's duck 'em !
le's drown 'em !
le's ride 'em on a rail !
and everybody was whooping at once , and there was a rattling powwow .
but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells , and says : gentlemengentlemen !
hear me just a wordjust a single wordif you please !
there's one way yetlet's go and dig up the corpse and look .
that took them .
hooray !
they all shouted , and was starting right off ; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out : hold on , hold on !
collar all these four men and the boy , and fetch them along , too !
we'll do it !
they all shouted ; and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang !
i was scared , now , i tell you .
but there warn't no getting away , you know .
they gripped us all , and marched us right along , straight for the graveyard , which was a mile and a half down the river , and the whole town at our heels , for we made noise enough , and it was only nine in the evening .
as we went by our house i wished i hadn't sent mary jane out of town ; because now if i could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me , and blow on our deadbeats .
well , we swarmed along down the river road , just carrying on like wildcats ; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up , and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter , and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves .
this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in ; and i was kinder stunned ; everything was going so different from what i had allowed for ; stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to , and see all the fun , and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come , here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks .
if they didn't find them i couldn't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , i couldn't think about nothing else .
it got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wristhinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip .
he dragged me right along , he was so excited , and i had to run to keep up .
when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow .
and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern .
but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning , and sent a man to the nearest house , a half a mile off , to borrow one .
so they dug and dug like everything ; and it got awful dark , and the rain started , and the wind swished and swushed along , and the lightning come brisker and brisker , and the thunder boomed ; but them people never took no notice of it , they was so full of this business ; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd , and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave , and the next second the dark wiped it all out , and you couldn't see nothing at all .
at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid , and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was , to scrouge in and get a sight , you never see ; and in the dark , that way , it was awful .
hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so , and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world , he was so excited and panting .
all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare , and somebody sings out : by the living jingo , here's the bag of gold on his breast !
hines let out a whoop , like everybody else , and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look , and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell .
i had the road all to myself , and i fairly flewleastways , i had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the nowandthen glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder ; and sure as you are born i did clip it along !
when i struck the town i see there warn't nobody out in the storm , so i never hunted for no back streets , but humped it straight through the main one ; and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it .
no light there ; the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and disappointed , i didn't know why .
but at last , just as i was sailing by , flash comes the light in mary jane's window !
and my heart swelled up sudden , like to bust ; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark , and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world .
she was the best girl i ever see , and had the most sand .
the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead , i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow , and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained i snatched it and shoved .
it was a canoe , and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope .
the towhead was a rattling big distance off , away out there in the middle of the river , but i didn't lose no time ; and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it .
but i didn't .
as i sprung aboard i sung out : out with you , jim , and set her loose !
glory be to goodness , we're shut of them !
jim lit out , and was acoming for me with both arms spread , he was so full of joy ; but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards ; for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded arab all in one , and it most scared the livers and lights out of me .
but jim fished me out , and was going to hug me and bless me , and so on , he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke , but i says : not now ; have it for breakfast , have it for breakfast !
cut loose and let her slide !
so in two seconds away we went asliding down the river , and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us .
i had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few timesi couldn't help it ; but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited ; and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come !
andjust alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum !
it was the king and the duke .
so i wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up ; and it was all i could do to keep from crying .
when they got aboard the king went for me , and shook me by the collar , and says : tryin' to give us the slip , was ye , you pup !
tired of our company , hey ?
i says : no , your majesty , we warn'tplease don't , your majesty !
quick , then , and tell us what was your idea , or i'll shake the insides out o' you !
honest , i'll tell you everything just as it happened , your majesty .
the man that had aholt of me was very good to me , and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year , and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold , and made a rush for the coffin , he lets go of me and whispers , 'heel it now , or they'll hang ye , sure !
'and i lit out .
it didn't seem no good for me to stayi couldn't do nothing , and i didn't want to be hung if i could get away .
so i never stopped running till i found the canoe ; and when i got here i told jim to hurry , or they'd catch me and hang me yet , and said i was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now , and i was awful sorry , and so was jim , and was awful glad when we see you coming ; you may ask jim if i didn't .
jim said it was so ; and the king told him to shut up , and said , oh , yes , it's mighty likely !
and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he'd drownd me .
but the duke says : leggo the boy , you old idiot !
would you a done any different ?
did you inquire around for him when you got loose ?
i don't remember it .
so the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it .
but the duke says : you better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing , for you're the one that's entitled to it most .
you hain't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary bluearrow mark .
that was brightit was right down bully ; and it was the thing that saved us .
for if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailed us till them englishmen's baggage comeand thenthe penitentiary , you bet !
but that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to wear , toolonger than we'd need 'em .
they was still a minutethinking ; then the king says , kind of absentminded like : mf !
and we reckoned the niggers stole it !
that made me squirm !
yes , says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , we did .
after about a half a minute the king drawls out : leastways , i did .
the duke says , the same way : on the contrary , i did .
the king kind of ruffles up , and says : looky here , bilgewater , what'r you referrin' to ?
the duke says , pretty brisk : when it comes to that , maybe you'll let me ask , what was you referring to ?
shucks !
says the king , very sarcastic ; but i don't knowmaybe you was asleep , and didn't know what you was about .
the duke bristles up now , and says : oh , let up on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame' fool ?
don't you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin ?
yes , sir !
i know you do know , because you done it yourself !
it's a lie !
andthe duke went for him .
the king sings out : take y'r hands off !
leggomy throat !
itake it all back !
the duke says : well , you just own up , first , that you did hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself .
wait jest a minute , dukeanswer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you didn't put the money there , say it , and i'll b'lieve you , and take back everything i said .
you old scoundrel , i didn't , and you know i didn't .
there , now !
well , then , i b'lieve you .
but answer me only jest this one morenow don't git mad ; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it ?
the duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : well , i don't care if i did , i didn't do it , anyway .
but you not only had it in mind to do it , but you done it .
i wisht i never die if i done it , duke , and that's honest .
i won't say i warn't goin' to do it , because i was ; but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o' me .
it's a lie !
you done it , and you got to say you done it , or the king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : 'nough !
iown up !
i was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before .
so the duke took his hands off and says : if you ever deny it again i'll drown you .
it's well for you to set there and blubber like a babyit's fitten for you , after the way you've acted .
i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everythingand i atrusting you all the time , like you was my own father .
you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em .
it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage .
cuss you , i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted to get what money i'd got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it all !
the king says , timid , and still asnuffling : why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it warn't me .
dry up !
i don't want to hear no more out of you !
says the duke .
and now you see what you got by it .
they've got all their own money back , and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides .
g'long to bed , and don't you deffersit me no more deffersits , long 's you live !
so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled his bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off asnoring in each other's arms .
they both got powerful mellow , but i noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again .
that made me feel easy and satisfied .
of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and i told jim everything .
we dasn't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river .
we was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home .
we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards .
it was the first i ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal .
so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again .
first they done a lecture on temperance ; but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on .
then in another village they started a dancingschool ; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town .
another time they tried to go at yellocution ; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing , and made them skip out .
they tackled missionarying , and mesmerizing , and doctoring , and telling fortunes , and a little of everything ; but they couldn't seem to have no luck .
so at last they got just about dead broke , and laid around the raft as she floated along , thinking and thinking , and never saying nothing , by the half a day at a time , and dreadful blue and desperate .
and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time .
jim and me got uneasy .
we didn't like the look of it .
we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever .
we turned it over and over , and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store , or was going into the counterfeitmoney business , or something .
so then we was pretty scared , and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions , and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind .
well , early one morning we hid the raft in a good , safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville , and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet .
house to rob , you mean , says i to myself ; and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raftand you'll have to take it out in wondering .
and he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right , and we was to come along .
so we stayed where we was .
the duke he fretted and sweated around , and was in a mighty sour way .
he scolded us for everything , and we couldn't seem to do nothing right ; he found fault with every little thing .
something was abrewing , sure .
i was good and glad when midday come and no king ; we could have a change , anywayand maybe a chance for the change on top of it .
so me and the duke went up to the village , and hunted around there for the king , and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery , very tight , and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport , and he acussing and athreatening with all his might , and so tight he couldn't walk , and couldn't do nothing to them .
the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool , and the king begun to sass back , and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs , and spun down the river road like a deer , for i see our chance ; and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again .
i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy , and sung out : set her loose , jim !
we're all right now !
but there warn't no answer , and nobody come out of the wigwam .
jim was gone !
i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one ; and run this way and that in the woods , whooping and screeching ; but it warn't no useold jim was gone .
then i set down and cried ; i couldn't help it .
but i couldn't set still long .
pretty soon i went out on the road , trying to think what i better do , and i run across a boy walking , and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : yes .
whereabouts ?
says i .
down to silas phelps' place , two mile below here .
he's a runaway nigger , and they've got him .
was you looking for him ?
you bet i ain't !
i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago , and he said if i hollered he'd cut my livers outand told me to lay down and stay where i was ; and i done it .
been there ever since ; afeard to come out .
well , he says , you needn't be afeard no more , becuz they've got him .
he run off f'm down south , som'ers .
it's a good job they got him .
well , i reckon !
there's two hunderd dollars reward on him .
it's like picking up money out'n the road .
yes , it isand i could a had it if i'd been big enough ; i see him first .
who nailed him ?
it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars , becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait .
think o' that , now !
you bet i'd wait , if it was seven year .
that's me , every time , says i .
but maybe his chance ain't worth no more than that , if he'll sell it so cheap .
maybe there's something ain't straight about it .
but it is , thoughstraight as a string .
i see the handbill myself .
it tells all about him , to a dotpaints him like a picture , and tells the plantation he's frum , below newrleans .
nosirreebob , they ain't no trouble 'bout that speculation , you bet you .
say , gimme a chaw tobacker , won't ye ?
i didn't have none , so he left .
i went to the raft , and set down in the wigwam to think .
but i couldn't come to nothing .
i thought till i wore my head sore , but i couldn't see no way out of the trouble .
after all this long journey , and after all we'd done for them scoundrels , here it was all come to nothing , everything all busted up and ruined , because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that , and make him a slave again all his life , and amongst strangers , too , for forty dirty dollars .
once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was , as long as he'd got to be a slave , and so i'd better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was .
but i soon give up that notion for two things : she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her , and so she'd sell him straight down the river again ; and if she didn't , everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger , and they'd make jim feel it all the time , and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced .
and then think of me !
it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ; and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again i'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame .
that's just the way : a person does a lowdown thing , and then he don't want to take no consequences of it .
thinks as long as he can hide it , it ain't no disgrace .
that was my fix exactly .
the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me , and the more wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling .
and at last , when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven , whilst i was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm , and now was showing me there's one that's always on the lookout , and ain't agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further , i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared .
well , i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked , and so i warn't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , there was the sundayschool , you could a gone to it ; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as i'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire .
it made me shiver .
and i about made up my mind to pray , and see if i couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better .
so i kneeled down .
but the words wouldn't come .
why wouldn't they ?
it warn't no use to try and hide it from him .
nor from me , neither .
i knowed very well why they wouldn't come .
it was because my heart warn't right ; it was because i warn't square ; it was because i was playing double .
i was letting on to give up sin , but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all .
i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing , and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was ; but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie , and he knowed it .
you can't pray a liei found that out .
so i was full of trouble , full as i could be ; and didn't know what to do .
at last i had an idea ; and i says , i'll go and write the letterand then see if i can pray .
why , it was astonishing , the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone .
so i got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : miss watson , your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville , and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send .
huck finn .
i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life , and i knowed i could pray now .
but i didn't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near i come to being lost and going to hell .
and went on thinking .
and got to thinking over our trip down the river ; and i see jim before me all the time : in the day and in the nighttime , sometimes moonlight , sometimes storms , and we afloating along , talking and singing and laughing .
but somehow i couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him , but only the other kind .
i'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n , 'stead of calling me , so i could go on sleeping ; and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog ; and when i come to him again in the swamp , up there where the feud was ; and suchlike times ; and would always call me honey , and pet me and do everything he could think of for me , and how good he always was ; and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard , and he was so grateful , and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world , and the only one he's got now ; and then i happened to look around and see that paper .
it was a close place .
i took it up , and held it in my hand .
i was atrembling , because i'd got to decide , forever , betwixt two things , and i knowed it .
i studied a minute , sort of holding my breath , and then says to myself : all right , then , i'll go to helland tore it up .
it was awful thoughts and awful words , but they was said .
and i let them stay said ; and never thought no more about reforming .
i shoved the whole thing out of my head , and said i would take up wickedness again , which was in my line , being brung up to it , and the other warn't .
and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again ; and if i could think up anything worse , i would do that , too ; because as long as i was in , and in for good , i might as well go the whole hog .
then i set to thinking over how to get at it , and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind ; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me .
so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece , and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it , and hid it there , and then turned in .
i slept the night through , and got up before it was light , and had my breakfast , and put on my store clothes , and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle , and took the canoe and cleared for shore .
i landed below where i judged was phelps's place , and hid my bundle in the woods , and then filled up the canoe with water , and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her , about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank .
then i struck up the road , and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it , phelps's sawmill , and when i come to the farmhouses , two or three hundred yards further along , i kept my eyes peeled , but didn't see nobody around , though it was good daylight now .
but i didn't mind , because i didn't want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get the lay of the land .
according to my plan , i was going to turn up there from the village , not from below .
so i just took a look , and shoved along , straight for town .
well , the very first man i see when i got there was the duke .
he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike that other time .
they had the cheek , them frauds !
i was right on him before i could shirk .
he looked astonished , and says : hello !
where'd you come from ?
then he says , kind of glad and eager , where's the raft ?
gother in a good place ?
i says : why , that's just what i was going to ask your grace .
then he didn't look so joyful , and says : what was your idea for asking me ?
he says .
well , i says , when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself , we can't get him home for hours , till he's soberer ; so i went aloafing around town to put in the time and wait .
a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep , and so i went along ; but when we was dragging him to the boat , and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along , he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run , and we after him .
we didn't have no dog , and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out .
we never got him till dark ; then we fetched him over , and i started down for the raft .
when i got there and see it was gone , i says to myself , 'they've got into trouble and had to leave ; and they've took my nigger , which is the only nigger i've got in the world , and now i'm in a strange country , and ain't got no property no more , nor nothing , and no way to make my living ;' so i set down and cried .
i slept in the woods all night .
but what did become of the raft , then ?
andjimpoor jim !
blamed if i knowthat is , what's become of the raft .
that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky ; and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , 'that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river .
'i wouldn't shake my nigger , would i ?
theonly nigger i had in the world , and the only property .
we never thought of that .
fact is , i reckon we'd come to consider him our nigger ; yes , we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for him .
so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there warn't anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake .
and i've pegged along ever since , dry as a powderhorn .
where's that ten cents ?
give it here .
i had considerable money , so i give him ten cents , but begged him to spend it for something to eat , and give me some , because it was all the money i had , and i hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday .
he never said nothing .
the next minute he whirls on me and says : do you reckon that nigger would blow on us ?
we'd skin him if he done that !
how can he blow ?
hain't he run off ?
no !
that old fool sold him , and never divided with me , and the money's gone .
sold him ?
i says , and begun to cry ; why , he was my nigger , and that was my money .
where is he ?
iwant my nigger .
well , you can't get your nigger , that's allso dry up your blubbering .
looky heredo you think you'd venture to blow on us ?
blamed if i think i'd trust you .
why , if you was to blow on us he stopped , but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
i went on awhimpering , and says : i don't want to blow on nobody ; and i ain't got no time to blow , nohow .
i got to turn out and find my nigger .
he looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead .
at last he says : i'll tell you something .
we got to be here three days .
if you'll promise you won't blow , and won't let the nigger blow , i'll tell you where to find him .
so i promised , and he says : a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped .
you see , he started to tell me the truth ; but when he stopped that way , and begun to study and think again , i reckoned he was changing his mind .
and so he was .
he wouldn't trust me ; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days .
so pretty soon he says : the man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g .
fosterand he lives forty mile back here in the country , on the road to lafayette .
all right , i says , i can walk it in three days .
and i'll start this very afternoon .
no you wont , you'll start now ; and don't you lose any time about it , neither , nor do any gabbling by the way .
just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along , and then you won't get into trouble with us , d'ye hear ?
that was the order i wanted , and that was the one i played for .
i wanted to be left free to work my plans .
so clear out , he says ; and you can tell mr. foster whatever you want to .
maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersome idiots don't require documentsleastways i've heard there's such down south here .
and when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus , maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out .
go 'long now , and tell him anything you want to ; but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there .
so i left , and struck for the back country .
i didn't look around , but i kinder felt like he was watching me .
but i knowed i could tire him out at that .
i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped ; then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps' .
i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because i wanted to stop jim's mouth till these fellows could get away .
i didn't want no trouble with their kind .
i'd seen all i wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them .
when i got there it was all still and sundaylike , and hot and sunshiny ; the hands was gone to the fields ; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone ; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it's spirits whisperingspirits that's been dead ever so many yearsand you always think they're talking about you .
as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead , too , and done with it all .
phelps' was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations , and they all look alike .
a rail fence round a twoacre yard ; a stile made out of logs sawed off and upended in steps , like barrels of a different length , to climb over the fence with , and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse ; some sickly grasspatches in the big yard , but mostly it was bare and smooth , like an old hat with the nap rubbed off ; big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs , with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar , and these mudstripes been whitewashed some time or another ; roundlog kitchen , with a big broad , open but roofed passage joining it to the house ; log smokehouse back of the kitchen ; three little log niggercabins in a row t'other side the smokehouse ; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence , and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ; ashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut ; bench by the kitchen door , with bucket of water and a gourd ; hound asleep there in the sun ; more hounds asleep round about ; about three shade trees away off in a corner ; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence ; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch ; then the cotton fields begins , and after the fields the woods .
i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper , and started for the kitchen .
when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again ; and then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world .
i went right along , not fixing up any particular plan , but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come ; for i'd noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone .
when i got halfway , first one hound and then another got up and went for me , and of course i stopped and faced them , and kept still .
and such another powwow as they made !
in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel , as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of fifteen of them packed together around me , with their necks and noses stretched up towards me , abarking and howling ; and more acoming ; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres .
a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her hand , singing out , begone you tige !
you spot !
begone sah !
and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling , and then the rest followed ; and the next second half of them come back , wagging their tails around me , and making friends with me .
there ain't no harm in a hound , nohow .
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but towlinen shirts , and they hung on to their mother's gown , and peeped out from behind her at me , bashful , the way they always do .
and here comes the white woman running from the house , about fortyfive or fifty year old , bareheaded , and her spinningstick in her hand ; and behind her comes her little white children , acting the same way the little niggers was doing .
she was smiling all over so she could hardly standand says : it's you , at last !
ain'tit ?
i out with a yes'm before i thought .
she grabbed me and hugged me tight ; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ; and the tears come in her eyes , and run down over ; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough , and kept saying , you don't look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would ; but law sakes , i don't care for that , i'm so glad to see you !
dear , dear , it does seem like i could eat you up !
children , it's your cousin tom !
tellhim howdy .
but they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her .
so she run on : lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get your breakfast on the boat ?
i said i had got it on the boat .
so then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after .
when we got there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : now i can have a good look at you ; and , lawsame , i've been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it's come at last !
we been expecting you a couple of days and more .
what kep' you ?
boatget aground ?
yes'mshe don't say yes'msay aunt sally .
where'd she get aground ?
i didn't rightly know what to say , because i didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down .
but i go a good deal on instinct ; and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans .
that didn't help me much , though ; for i didn't know the names of bars down that way .
i see i'd got to invent a bar , or forget the name of the one we got aground onornow i struck an idea , and fetched it out : it warn't the groundingthat didn't keep us back but a little .
we blowed out a cylinderhead .
good gracious !
anybody hurt ?
no'm .
killed a nigger .
well , it's lucky ; because sometimes people do get hurt .
two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook , and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man .
and i think he died afterwards .
he was a baptist .
your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well .
yes , i remember now , he did die .
mortification set in , and they had to amputate him .
but it didn't save him .
yes , it was mortificationthat was it .
he turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection .
they say he was a sight to look at .
your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you .
and he's gone again , not more'n an hour ago ; he'll be back any minute now .
you must a met him on the road , didn't you ?
oldishman , with a no , i didn't see nobody , aunt sally .
the boat landed just at daylight , and i left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country , to put in the time and not get here too soon ; and so i come down the back way .
who'd you give the baggage to ?
nobody .
why , child , it 'll be stole !
not where i hid it i reckon it won't , i says .
how'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat ?
it was kinder thin ice , but i says : the captain see me standing around , and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore ; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch , and give me all i wanted .
i was getting so uneasy i couldn't listen good .
i had my mind on the children all the time ; i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little , and find out who i was .
but i couldn't get no show , mrs. phelps kept it up and run on so .
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : but here we're arunning on this way , and you hain't told me a word about sis , nor any of them .
now i'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me everythingtell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of .
well , i see i was up a stumpand up it good .
providence had stood by me this fur all right , but i was hard and tight aground now .
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go aheadi'd got to throw up my hand .
so i says to myself , here's another place where i got to resk the truth .
i opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : here he comes !
stick your head down lowerthere , that'll do ; you can't be seen now .
don't you let on you're here .
i'll play a joke on him .
children , don't you say a word .
i see i was in a fix now .
but it warn't no use to worry ; there warn't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck .
i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him .
mrs .
phelps she jumps for him , and says : has he come ?
no , says her husband .
goodness gracious !
she says , what in the warld can have become of him ?
i can't imagine , says the old gentleman ; and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy .
uneasy !
she says ; i'm ready to go distracted !
he must a come ; and you've missed him along the road .
i know it's sosomething tells me so .
why , sally , i couldn't miss him along the roadyou know that .
but oh , dear , dear , what will sis say !
he must a come !
you must a missed him .
he oh , don't distress me any more'n i'm already distressed .
i don't know what in the world to make of it .
i'm at my wit's end , and i don't mind acknowledging 't i'm right down scared .
but there's no hope that he's come ; for he couldn't come and me miss him .
sally , it's terriblejust terriblesomething's happened to the boat , sure !
why , silas !
look yonder !
upthe road !
ain'tthat somebody coming ?
he sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give mrs. phelps the chance she wanted .
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out i come ; and when he turned back from the window there she stood , abeaming and asmiling like a house afire , and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside .
the old gentleman stared , and says : why , who's that ?
who do you reckon 't is ?
i hain't no idea .
who is it ?
it's tom sawyer !
by jings , i most slumped through the floor !
but there warn't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about sid , and mary , and the rest of the tribe .
but if they was joyful , it warn't nothing to what i was ; for it was like being born again , i was so glad to find out who i was .
well , they froze to me for two hours ; and at last , when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more , i had told them more about my familyi mean the sawyer familythan ever happened to any six sawyer families .
and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of white river , and it took us three days to fix it .
which was all right , and worked firstrate ; because they didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it .
if i'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well .
now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other .
being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river .
then i says to myself , s'pose tom sawyer comes down on that boat ?
and s'pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet ?
well , i couldn't have it that way ; it wouldn't do at all .
i must go up the road and waylay him .
so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage .
the old gentleman was for going along with me , but i said no , i could drive the horse myself , and i druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me .
so i started for town in the wagon , and when i was halfway i see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was tom sawyer , and i stopped and waited till he come along .
i says hold on !
and it stopped alongside , and his mouth opened up like a trunk , and stayed so ; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat , and then says : i hain't ever done you no harm .
you know that .
so , then , what you want to come back and ha'nt me for ?
i says : i hain't come backi hain't been gone .
when he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he warn't quite satisfied yet .
he says : don't you play nothing on me , because i wouldn't on you .
honest injun now , you ain't a ghost ?
honest injun , i ain't , i says .
welliiwell , that ought to settle it , of course ; but i can't somehow seem to understand it no way .
looky here , warn't you ever murdered at all ?
no .
i warn't ever murdered at alli played it on them .
you come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me .
so he done it ; and it satisfied him ; and he was that glad to see me again he didn't know what to do .
and he wanted to know all about it right off , because it was a grand adventure , and mysterious , and so it hit him where he lived .
but i said , leave it alone till by and by ; and told his driver to wait , and we drove off a little piece , and i told him the kind of a fix i was in , and what did he reckon we better do ?
he said , let him alone a minute , and don't disturb him .
so he thought and thought , and pretty soon he says : it's all right ; i've got it .
take my trunk in your wagon , and let on it's your'n ; and you turn back and fool along slow , so as to get to the house about the time you ought to ; and i'll go towards town a piece , and take a fresh start , and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you ; and you needn't let on to know me at first .
i says : all right ; but wait a minute .
there's one more thinga thing that nobody don't know but me .
and that is , there's a nigger here that i'm atrying to steal out of slavery , and his name is jimold miss watson's jim .
he says : what !
why , jim is he stopped and went to studying .
i says : i know what you'll say .
you'll say it's dirty , lowdown business ; but what if it is ?
i'm low down ; and i'm agoing to steal him , and i want you keep mum and not let on .
will you ?
his eye lit up , and he says : i'll help you steal him !
well , i let go all holts then , like i was shot .
it was the most astonishing speech i ever heardand i'm bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation .
only i couldn't believe it .
tom sawyer a niggerstealer !
oh , shucks !
i says ; you're joking .
i ain't joking , either .
well , then , i says , joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , don't forget to remember that you don't know nothing about him , and i don't know nothing about him .
then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and i drove mine .
but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip .
the old gentleman was at the door , and he says : why , this is wonderful !
whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ?
i wish we'd a timed her .
and she hain't sweated a hairnot a hair .
it's wonderful .
why , i wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse nowi wouldn't , honest ; and yet i'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 'twas all she was worth .
that's all he said .
he was the innocentest , best old soul i ever see .
but it warn't surprising ; because he warn't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little onehorse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too .
there was plenty other farmerpreachers like that , and done the same way , down south .
in about half an hour tom's wagon drove up to the front stile , and aunt sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : why , there's somebody come !
i wonder who 'tis ?
why , i do believe it's a stranger .
jimmy that's one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner .
everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger don't come every year , and so he lays over the yallerfever , for interest , when he does come .
tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door .
tom had his store clothes on , and an audienceand that was always nuts for tom sawyer .
in them circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable .
he warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca'm and important , like the ram .
when he got afront of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them , and says : mr .
archibald nichols , i presume ?
no , my boy , says the old gentleman , i'm sorry to say 't your driver has deceived you ; nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more .
come in , come in .
tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , too latehe's out of sight .
yes , he's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to nichols's .
oh , i can't make you so much trouble ; i couldn't think of it .
i'll walki don't mind the distance .
but we won't let you walkit wouldn't be southern hospitality to do it .
come right in .
oh , do , says aunt sally ; it ain't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world .
you must stay .
it's a long , dusty three mile , and we can't let you walk .
and , besides , i've already told 'em to put on another plate when i see you coming ; so you mustn't disappoint us .
come right in and make yourself at home .
so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville , ohio , and his name was william thompsonand he made another bow .
well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and i getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : you owdacious puppy !
he looked kind of hurt , and says : i'm surprised at you , m'am .
you're s'rpwhy , what do you reckon i am ?
i've a good notion to take andsay , what do you mean by kissing me ?
he looked kind of humble , and says : i didn't mean nothing , m'am .
i didn't mean no harm .
iithought you'd like it .
why , you born fool !
she took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it .
what made you think i'd like it ?
well , i don't know .
only , theytheytold me you would .
they told you i would .
whoever told you's another lunatic .
i never heard the beat of it .
who's they ?
why , everybody .
they all said so , m'am .
it was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says : who's 'everybody' ?
out with their names , or ther'll be an idiot short .
he got up and looked distressed , and fumbled his hat , and says : i'm sorry , and i warn't expecting it .
they told me to .
they all told me to .
they all said , kiss her ; and said she'd like it .
they all said itevery one of them .
but i'm sorry , m'am , and i won't do it no morei won't , honest .
you won't , won't you ?
well , i sh'd reckon you won't !
no'm , i'm honest about it ; i won't ever do it againtill you ask me .
till i ask you !
well , i never see the beat of it in my born days !
i lay you'll be the methusalemnumskull of creation before ever i ask youor the likes of you .
well , he says , it does surprise me so .
i can't make it out , somehow .
they said you would , and i thought you would .
but he stopped and looked around slow , like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres , and fetched up on the old gentleman's , and says , didn't you think she'd like me to kiss her , sir ?
why , no ; iiwell , no , i b'lieve i didn't .
then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : tom , didn't you think aunt sally 'd open out her arms and say , 'sid sawyer' my land !
she says , breaking in and jumping for him , you impudent young rascal , to fool a body so and was going to hug him , but he fended her off , and says : no , not till you've asked me first .
so she didn't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left .
and after they got a little quiet again she says : why , dear me , i never see such a surprise .
we warn't looking for you at all , but only tom .
sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him .
it's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but tom , he says ; but i begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and tom thought it would be a firstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger .
but it was a mistake , aunt sally .
this ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come .
nonot impudent whelps , sid .
you ought to had your jaws boxed ; i hain't been so put out since i don't know when .
but i don't care , i don't mind the termsi'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here .
well , to think of that performance !
i don't deny it , i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack .
we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ; and there was things enough on that table for seven familiesand all hot , too ; none of your flabby , tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning .
uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it , but it was worth it ; and it didn't cool it a bit , neither , the way i've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times .
there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon , and me and tom was on the lookout all the time ; but it warn't no use , they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger , and we was afraid to try to work up to it .
but at supper , at night , one of the little boys says : pa , mayn't tom and sid and me go to the show ?
no , says the old man , i reckon there ain't going to be any ; and you couldn't go if there was ; because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show , and burton said he would tell the people ; so i reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time .
so there it was !
buti couldn't help it .
tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ; so , being tired , we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper , and clumb out of the window and down the lightningrod , and shoved for the town ; for i didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint , and so if i didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure .
on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered , and how pap disappeared pretty soon , and didn't come back no more , and what a stir there was when jim run away ; and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions , and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to ; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of itit was as much as halfafter eight , thenhere comes a raging rush of people with torches , and an awful whooping and yelling , and banging tin pans and blowing horns ; and we jumped to one side to let them go by ; and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a railthat is , i knowed it was the king and the duke , though they was all over tar and feathers , and didn't look like nothing in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldierplumes .
well , it made me sick to see it ; and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like i couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world .
it was a dreadful thing to see .
human beings can be awful cruel to one another .
we see we was too latecouldn't do no good .
we asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them .
so we poked along back home , and i warn't feeling so brash as i was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehowthough i hadn't done nothing .
but that's always the way ; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person's conscience ain't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway .
if i had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does i would pison him .
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides , and yet ain't no good , nohow .
tom sawyer he says the same .
we stopped talking , and got to thinking .
by and by tom says : looky here , huck , what fools we are to not think of it before !
i bet i know where jim is .
no !
where ?
in that hut down by the ashhopper .
why , looky here .
when we was at dinner , didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles ?
yes .
what did you think the vittles was for ?
for a dog .
so 'd i .
well , it wasn't for a dog .
why ?
because part of it was watermelon .
so it wasi noticed it .
well , it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon .
it shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time .
well , the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in , and he locked it again when he came out .
he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from tablesame key , i bet .
watermelon shows man , lock shows prisoner ; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation , and where the people's all so kind and good .
jim's the prisoner .
all righti'm glad we found it out detective fashion ; i wouldn't give shucks for any other way .
now you work your mind , and study out a plan to steal jim , and i will study out one , too ; and we'll take the one we like the best .
what a head for just a boy to have !
if i had tom sawyer's head i wouldn't trade it off to be a duke , nor mate of a steamboat , nor clown in a circus , nor nothing i can think of .
i went to thinking out a plan , but only just to be doing something ; i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from .
pretty soon tom says : ready ?
yes , i says .
all rightbring it out .
my plan is this , i says .
we can easy find out if it's jim in there .
then get up my canoe tomorrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island .
then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and jim used to do before .
wouldn't that plan work ?
work ?
why , cert'nly it would work , like rats afighting .
but it's too blame' simple ; there ain't nothing to it .
what's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that ?
it's as mild as goosemilk .
why , huck , it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory .
i never said nothing , because i warn't expecting nothing different ; but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it .
and it didn't .
he told me what it was , and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides .
so i was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it .
i needn't tell what it was here , because i knowed it wouldn't stay the way , it was .
i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance .
and that is what he done .
well , one thing was dead sure , and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest , and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery .
that was the thing that was too many for me .
here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leatherheaded ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody .
i couldn't understand it no way at all .
it was outrageous , and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so ; and so be his true friend , and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself .
and i did start to tell him ; but he shut me up , and says : don't you reckon i know what i'm about ?
don't i generly know what i'm about ?
yes .
didn't i say i was going to help steal the nigger ?
yes .
well , then .
that's all he said , and that's all i said .
it warn't no use to say any more ; because when he said he'd do a thing , he always done it .
but i couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ; so i just let it go , and never bothered no more about it .
if he was bound to have it so , i couldn't help it .
when we got home the house was all dark and still ; so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it .
we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do .
they knowed us , and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night .
when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ; and on the side i warn't acquainted withwhich was the north sidewe found a square windowhole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it .
i says : here's the ticket .
this hole's big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board .
tom says : it's as simple as tittattoe , threeinarow , and as easy as playing hooky .
i should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated than that , huck finn .
well , then , i says , how 'll it do to saw him out , the way i done before i was murdered that time ?
that's more like , he says .
it's real mysterious , and troublesome , and good , he says ; but i bet we can find a way that's twice as long .
there ain't no hurry ; le's keep on looking around .
betwixt the hut and the fence , on the back side , was a leanto that joined the hut at the eaves , and was made out of plank .
it was as long as the hut , but narrowonly about six foot wide .
the door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked .
tom he went to the soapkettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples .
the chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with it ; and there warn't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow .
the match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever .
tom was joyful .
he says ; now we're all right .
we'll dig him out .
it 'll take about a week !
then we started for the house , and i went in the back dooryou only have to pull a buckskin latchstring , they don't fasten the doorsbut that warn't romantical enough for tom sawyer ; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod .
but after he got up half way about three times , and missed fire and fell every time , and the last time most busted his brains out , he thought he'd got to give it up ; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck , and this time he made the trip .
in the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was being fed .
the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house .
this nigger had a goodnatured , chuckleheaded face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread .
that was to keep witches off .
he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
he got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he'd been agoing to do .
so tom says : what's the vittles for ?
going to feed the dogs ?
the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle , and he says : yes , mars sid , a dog .
cur'us dog , too .
does you want to go en look at 'im ?
yes .
i hunched tom , and whispers : you going , right here in the daybreak ?
that warn't the plan .
no , it warn't ; but it's the plan now .
so , drat him , we went along , but i didn't like it much .
when we got in we couldn't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : why , huck !
en good lan' !
ain' dat misto tom ?
i just knowed how it would be ; i just expected it .
i didn't know nothing to do ; and if i had i couldn't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : why , de gracious sakes !
do he know you genlmen ?
we could see pretty well now .
tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : does who know us ?
why , disyer runaway nigger .
i don't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ?
what put it dar ?
didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ?
tom says , in a puzzledup kind of way : well , that's mighty curious .
who sung out ?
when did he sing out ?
what did he sing out ?
and turns to me , perfectly ca'm , and says , did you hear anybody sing out ?
of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so i says : no ; i ain't heard nobody say nothing .
then he turns to jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : did you sing out ?
no , sah , says jim ; i hain't said nothing , sah .
not a word ?
no , sah , i hain't said a word .
did you ever see us before ?
no , sah ; not as i knows on .
so tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : what do you reckon's the matter with you , anyway ?
what made you think somebody sung out ?
oh , it's de dadblame' witches , sah , en i wisht i was dead , i do .
dey's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos' kill me , dey sk'yers me so .
please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah , er ole mars silas he'll scole me ; 'kase he say dey ain't no witches .
i jis' wish to goodness he was heah nowden what would he say !
i jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it dis time .
but it's awluz jis' so ; people dat's sot , stays sot ; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves , en when you fine it out en tell um 'bout it , dey doan' b'lieve you .
tom give him a dime , and said we wouldn't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at jim , and says : i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger .
if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , i wouldn't give him up , i'd hang him .
and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to jim and says : don't ever let on to know us .
and if you hear any digging going on nights , it's us ; we're going to set you free .
jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then .
it would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called foxfire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place .
we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and tom says , kind of dissatisfied : blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be .
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan .
there ain't no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman .
there ain't even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to .
and there's jim chained by one leg , with a tenfoot chain , to the leg of his bed : why , all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain .
and uncle silas he trusts everybody ; sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger , and don't send nobody to watch the nigger .
jim could a got out of that windowhole before this , only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg .
why , drat it , huck , it's the stupidest arrangement i ever see .
you got to invent all the difficulties .
well , we can't help it ; we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got .
anyhow , there's one thingthere's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers , where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them , and you had to contrive them all out of your own head .
now look at just that one thing of the lantern .
when you come down to the cold facts , we simply got to let on that a lantern's resky .
why , we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to , i believe .
now , whilst i think of it , we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get .
what do we want of a saw ?
what do we want of it ?
hain't we got to saw the leg of jim's bed off , so as to get the chain loose ?
why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off .
well , if that ain't just like you , huck finn .
you can get up the infantschooliest ways of going at a thing .
why , hain't you ever read any books at all ?
barontrenck , nor casanova , nor benvenuto chelleeny , nor henri iv .
 ,nor none of them heroes ?
who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that ?
no ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it can't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's being sawed , and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound .
then , the night you're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are .
nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you knowand there's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native langudoc , or navarre , or wherever it is .
it's gaudy , huck .
i wish there was a moat to this cabin .
if we get time , the night of the escape , we'll dig one .
i says : what do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under the cabin ?
but he never heard me .
he had forgot me and everything else .
he had his chin in his hand , thinking .
pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : no , it wouldn't dothere ain't necessity enough for it .
for what ?
i says .
why , to saw jim's leg off , he says .
good land !
i says ; why , there ain't no necessity for it .
and what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway ?
well , some of the best authorities has done it .
they couldn't get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved .
and a leg would be better still .
but we got to let that go .
there ain't necessity enough in this case ; and , besides , jim's a nigger , and wouldn't understand the reasons for it , and how it's the custom in europe ; so we'll let it go .
but there's one thinghe can have a rope ladder ; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough .
and we can send it to him in a pie ; it's mostly done that way .
and i've et worse pies .
why , tom sawyer , how you talk , i says ; jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder .
he has got use for it .
how you talk , you better say ; you don't know nothing about it .
he's got to have a rope ladder ; they all do .
what in the nation can he do with it ?
do with it ?
he can hide it in his bed , can't he ?
that's what they all do ; and he's got to , too .
huck , you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular ; you want to be starting something fresh all the time .
s'pose he don't do nothing with it ?
ain't it there in his bed , for a clew , after he's gone ?
and don't you reckon they'll want clews ?
of course they will .
and you wouldn't leave them any ?
that would be a pretty howdydo , wouldn't it !
i never heard of such a thing .
well , i says , if it's in the regulations , and he's got to have it , all right , let him have it ; because i don't wish to go back on no regulations ; but there's one thing , tom sawyerif we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder , we're going to get into trouble with aunt sally , just as sure as you're born .
now , the way i look at it , a hickrybark ladder don't cost nothing , and don't waste nothing , and is just as good to load up a pie with , and hide in a straw tick , as any rag ladder you can start ; and as for jim , he ain't had no experience , and so he don't care what kind of a oh , shucks , huck finn , if i was as ignorant as you i'd keep stillthat's what i'd do .
who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickrybark ladder ?
why , it's perfectly ridiculous .
well , all right , tom , fix it your own way ; but if you'll take my advice , you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline .
he said that would do .
and that gave him another idea , and he says : borrow a shirt , too .
what do we want of a shirt , tom ?
want it for jim to keep a journal on .
journal your grannyjim can't write .
s'pose he can't writehe can make marks on the shirt , can't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop ?
why , tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too .
prisoners don't have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of , you muggins .
they always make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall .
they wouldn't use a goosequill if they had it .
it ain't regular .
well , then , what'll we make him the ink out of ?
many makes it out of ironrust and tears ; but that's the common sort and women ; the best authorities uses their own blood .
jim can do that ; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated , he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window .
the iron mask always done that , and it's a blame' good way , too .
jim ain't got no tin plates .
they feed him in a pan .
that ain't nothing ; we can get him some .
can't nobody read his plates .
that ain't got anything to do with it , huck finn .
all he's got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out .
you don't have to be able to read it .
why , half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else .
well , then , what's the sense in wasting the plates ?
why , blame it all , it ain't the prisoner's plates .
but it's somebody's plates , ain't it ?
well , spos'n it is ?
what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there , because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing .
so we cleared out for the house .
along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothesline ; and i found an old sack and put them in it , and we went down and got the foxfire , and put that in too .
i called it borrowing , because that was what pap always called it ; but tom said it warn't borrowing , it was stealing .
he said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody don't blame them for it , either .
it ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , tom said ; it's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with .
he said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner .
so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy .
and yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for .
tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we needed .
well , i says , i needed the watermelon .
but he said i didn't need it to get out of prison with ; there's where the difference was .
he said if i'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right .
so i let it go at that , though i couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon .
well , as i was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then tom he carried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch .
by and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk .
he says : everything's all right now except tools ; and that's easy fixed .
tools ?
i says .
yes .
tools for what ?
why , to dig with .
we ain't agoing to gnaw him out , are we ?
ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ?
i says .
he turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : huck finn , did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ?
now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero ?
why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it .
picks and shovelswhy , they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king .
well , then , i says , if we don't want the picks and shovels , what do we want ?
a couple of caseknives .
to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ?
yes .
confound it , it's foolish , tom .
it don't make no difference how foolish it is , it's the right wayand it's the regular way .
and there ain't no other way , that ever i heard of , and i've read all the books that gives any information about these things .
they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt , mind you ; generly it's through solid rock .
and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever .
why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef , in the harbor of marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was he at it , you reckon ?
i don't know .
well , guess .
i don't know .
a month and a half .
thirtyseven yearand he come out in china .
that's the kind .
i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock .
jim don't know nobody in china .
what's that got to do with it ?
neither did that other fellow .
but you're always awandering off on a side issue .
why can't you stick to the main point ?
all righti don't care where he comes out , so he comes out ; and jim don't , either , i reckon .
but there's one thing , anywayjim's too old to be dug out with a caseknife .
he won't last .
yes he will last , too .
you don't reckon it's going to take thirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation , do you ?
how long will it take , tom ?
well , we can't resk being as long as we ought to , because it mayn't take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans .
he'll hear jim ain't from there .
then his next move will be to advertise jim , or something like that .
so we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to .
by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years ; but we can't .
things being so uncertain , what i recommend is this : that we really dig right in , as quick as we can ; and after that , we can let on , to ourselves , that we was at it thirtyseven years .
then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm .
yes , i reckon that 'll be the best way .
now , there's sense in that , i says .
letting on don't cost nothing ; letting on ain't no trouble ; and if it's any object , i don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year .
it wouldn't strain me none , after i got my hand in .
so i'll mosey along now , and smouch a couple of caseknives .
smouch three , he says ; we want one to make a saw out of .
tom , if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , i says , there's an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smokehouse .
he looked kind of weary and discouragedlike , and says : it ain't no use to try to learn you nothing , huck .
run along and smouch the knivesthree of them .
so i done it .
as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightningrod , and shut ourselves up in the leanto , and got out our pile of foxfire , and went to work .
we cleared everything out of the way , about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log .
tom said he was right behind jim's bed now , and we'd dig in under it , and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there , because jim's counterpin hung down most to the ground , and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole .
so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight ; and then we was dogtired , and our hands was blistered , and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly .
at last i says : this ain't no thirtyseven year job ; this is a thirtyeight year job , tom sawyer .
he never said nothing .
but he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking .
then he says : it ain't no use , huck , it ain't agoing to work .
if we was prisoners it would , because then we'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands wouldn't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done .
but we can't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ain't got no time to spare .
if we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldn't touch a caseknife with them sooner .
well , then , what we going to do , tom ?
i'll tell you .
it ain't right , and it ain't moral , and i wouldn't like it to get out ; but there ain't only just the one way : we got to dig him out with the picks , and let on it's caseknives .
now you're talking !
i says ; your head gets leveler and leveler all the time , tom sawyer , i says .
picks is the thing , moral or no moral ; and as for me , i don't care shucks for the morality of it , nohow .
when i start in to steal a nigger , or a watermelon , or a sundayschool book , i ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done .
what i want is my nigger ; or what i want is my watermelon ; or what i want is my sundayschool book ; and if a pick's the handiest thing , that's the thing i'm agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with ; and i don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther .
well , he says , there's excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like this ; if it warn't so , i wouldn't approve of it , nor i wouldn't stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right , and wrong is wrong , and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better .
it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick , without any letting on , because you don't know no better ; but it wouldn't for me , because i do know better .
gimme a caseknife .
he had his own by him , but i handed him mine .
he flung it down , and says : gimme a caseknife .
i didn't know just what to dobut then i thought .
i scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word .
he was always just that particular .
full of principle .
so then i got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly .
we stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it .
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightningrod , but he couldn't come it , his hands was so sore .
at last he says : it ain't no use , it can't be done .
what you reckon i better do ?
can't you think of no way ?
yes , i says , but i reckon it ain't regular .
come up the stairs , and let on it's a lightningrod .
so he done it .
next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house , for to make some pens for jim out of , and six tallow candles ; and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance , and stole three tin plates .
tom says it wasn't enough ; but i said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that jim throwed out , because they'd fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again .
so tom was satisfied .
then he says : now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to jim .
take them in through the hole , i says , when we get it done .
he only just looked scornful , and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea , and then he went to studying .
by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways , but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet .
said we'd got to post jim first .
that night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten , and took one of the candles along , and listened under the windowhole , and heard jim snoring ; so we pitched it in , and it didn't wake him .
then we whirled in with the pick and shovel , and in about two hours and a half the job was done .
we crept in under jim's bed and into the cabin , and pawed around and found the candle and lit it , and stood over jim awhile , and found him looking hearty and healthy , and then we woke him up gentle and gradual .
he was so glad to see us he most cried ; and called us honey , and all the pet names he could think of ; and was for having us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away , and clearing out without losing any time .
but tom he showed him how unregular it would be , and set down and told him all about our plans , and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ; and not to be the least afraid , because we would see he got away , sure .
so jim he said it was all right , and we set there and talked over old times awhile , and then tom asked a lot of questions , and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him , and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat , and both of them was kind as they could be , tom says : now i know how to fix it .
we'll send you some things by them .
i said , don't do nothing of the kind ; it's one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck ; but he never paid no attention to me ; went right on .
it was his way when he'd got his plans set .
so he told jim how we'd have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by nat , the nigger that fed him , and he must be on the lookout , and not be surprised , and not let nat see him open them ; and we would put small things in uncle's coatpockets and he must steal them out ; and we would tie things to aunt's apronstrings or put them in her apronpocket , if we got a chance ; and told him what they would be and what they was for .
and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood , and all that .
he told him everything .
jim he couldn't see no sense in the most of it , but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ; so he was satisfied , and said he would do it all just as tom said .
jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco ; so we had a right down good sociable time ; then we crawled out through the hole , and so home to bed , with hands that looked like they'd been chawed .
tom was in high spirits .
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life , and the most intellectural ; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out ; for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it .
he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year , and would be the best time on record .
and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it .
in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes , and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket .
then we went to the nigger cabins , and while i got nat's notice off , tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a cornpone that was in jim's pan , and we went along with nat to see how it would work , and it just worked noble ; when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better .
tom said so himself .
jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread , you know ; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first .
and whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light , here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim's bed ; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them , and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath .
by jings , we forgot to fasten that leanto door !
the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once , and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs , and begun to groan like he was dying .
tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim's meat , and the dogs went for it , and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door , and i knowed he'd fixed the other door too .
then he went to work on the nigger , coaxing him and petting him , and asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again .
he raised up , and blinked his eyes around , and says : mars sid , you'll say i's a fool , but if i didn't b'lieve i see most a million dogs , er devils , er some'n , i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks .
i did , mos' sholy .
mars sid , i felt umi felt um , sah ; dey was all over me .
dad fetch it , i jis' wisht i could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunston'y jis' wunstit's all i'd ast .
but mos'ly i wisht dey'd lemme 'lone , i does .
tom says : well , i tell you what i think .
what makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfasttime ?
it's because they're hungry ; that's the reason .
you make them a witch pie ; that's the thing for you to do .
but my lan' , mars sid , how's i gwyne to make 'm a witch pie ?
i doan' know how to make it .
i hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo' .
well , then , i'll have to make it myself .
will you do it , honey ?
willyou ?
i'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot , i will !
all right , i'll do it , seeing it's you , and you've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger .
but you got to be mighty careful .
when we come around , you turn your back ; and then whatever we've put in the pan , don't you let on you see it at all .
and don't you look when jim unloads the pansomething might happen , i don't know what .
and above all , don't you handle the witchthings .
hannel 'm , mars sid ?
what is you atalkin' 'bout ?
i wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um , not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars , i wouldn't .
that was all fixed .
so then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in the back yard , where they keep the old boots , and rags , and pieces of bottles , and woreout tin things , and all such truck , and scratched around and found an old tin washpan , and stopped up the holes as well as we could , to bake the pie in , and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast , and found a couple of shinglenails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with , and dropped one of them in aunt sally's apronpocket which was hanging on a chair , and t'other we stuck in the band of uncle silas's hat , which was on the bureau , because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning , and then went to breakfast , and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas's coatpocket , and aunt sally wasn't come yet , so we had to wait a little while .
and when she come she was hot and red and cross , and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing ; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other , and says : i've hunted high and i've hunted low , and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt .
my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things , and a hard piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough , and was shot across the table , and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm , and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop , and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills , and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that , and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder .
but after that we was all right againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold .
uncle silas he says : it's most uncommon curious , i can't understand it .
i know perfectly well i took it off , because because you hain't got but one on .
just listen at the man !
i know you took it off , and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory , too , because it was on the clo'sline yesterdayi see it there myself .
but it's gone , that's the long and the short of it , and you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till i can get time to make a new one .
and it 'll be the third i've made in two years .
it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts ; and whatever you do manage to do with 'm all is more'n i can make out .
a body 'd think you would learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life .
i know it , sally , and i do try all i can .
but it oughtn't to be altogether my fault , because , you know , i don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me ; and i don't believe i've ever lost one of them off of me .
well , it ain't your fault if you haven't , silas ; you'd a done it if you could , i reckon .
and the shirt ain't all that's gone , nuther .
ther's a spoon gone ; and that ain't all .
there was ten , and now ther's only nine .
the calf got the shirt , i reckon , but the calf never took the spoon , that's certain .
why , what else is gone , sally ?
ther's six candles gonethat's what .
the rats could a got the candles , and i reckon they did ; i wonder they don't walk off with the whole place , the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it ; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair , silasyou'd never find it out ; but you can't lay the spoon on the rats , and that i know .
well , sally , i'm in fault , and i acknowledge it ; i've been remiss ; but i won't let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes .
oh , i wouldn't hurry ; next year 'll do .
matilda angelina araminta phelps !
whack comes the thimble , and the child snatches her claws out of the sugarbowl without fooling around any .
just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage , and says : missus , dey's a sheet gone .
a sheet gone !
well , for the land's sake !
i'll stop up them holes today , says uncle silas , looking sorrowful .
oh , do shet up !
s'posethe rats took the sheet ?
where's it gone , lize ?
clah to goodness i hain't no notion , miss' sally .
she wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain' dah no mo' now .
i reckon the world is coming to an end .
i never see the beat of it in all my born days .
a shirt , and a sheet , and a spoon , and six can missus , comes a young yaller wench , dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n .
cler out from here , you hussy , er i'll take a skillet to ye !
well , she was just abiling .
i begun to lay for a chance ; i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated .
she kept araging right along , running her insurrection all by herself , and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ; and at last uncle silas , looking kind of foolish , fishes up that spoon out of his pocket .
she stopped , with her mouth open and her hands up ; and as for me , i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres .
but not long , because she says : it's just as i expected .
so you had it in your pocket all the time ; and like as not you've got the other things there , too .
how'd it get there ?
i reely don't know , sally , he says , kind of apologizing , or you know i would tell .
i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast , and i reckon i put it in there , not noticing , meaning to put my testament in , and it must be so , because my testament ain't in ; but i'll go and see ; and if the testament is where i had it , i'll know i didn't put it in , and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon , and oh , for the land's sake !
give a body a rest !
go 'long now , the whole kit and biling of ye ; and don't come nigh me again till i've got back my peace of mind .
i'd a heard her if she'd a said it to herself , let alone speaking it out ; and i'd a got up and obeyed her if i'd a been dead .
as we was passing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat , and the shinglenail fell out on the floor , and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantelshelf , and never said nothing , and went out .
tom see him do it , and remembered about the spoon , and says : well , it ain't no use to send things by him no more , he ain't reliable .
then he says : but he done us a good turn with the spoon , anyway , without knowing it , and so we'll go and do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes .
there was a noble good lot of them down cellar , and it took us a whole hour , but we done the job tight and good and shipshape .
then we heard steps on the stairs , and blowed out our light and hid ; and here comes the old man , with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other , looking as absentminded as year before last .
he went a mooning around , first to one rathole and then another , till he'd been to them all .
then he stood about five minutes , picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking .
then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs , saying : well , for the life of me i can't remember when i done it .
i could show her now that i warn't to blame on account of the rats .
but never mindlet it go .
i reckon it wouldn't do no good .
and so he went on amumbling up stairs , and then we left .
he was a mighty nice old man .
and always is .
tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we'd got to have it ; so he took a think .
when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming , and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and i slid one of them up my sleeve , and tom says : why , aunt sally , there ain't but nine spoons yet .
she says : go 'long to your play , and don't bother me .
i know better , i counted 'm myself .
well , i've counted them twice , aunty , and i can't make but nine .
she looked out of all patience , but of course she come to countanybody would .
i declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine !
she says .
why , what in the worldplague take the things , i'll count 'm again .
so i slipped back the one i had , and when she got done counting , she says : hang the troublesome rubbage , ther's ten now !
and she looked huffy and bothered both .
but tom says : why , aunty , i don't think there's ten .
you numskull , didn't you see me count 'm ?
i know , but well , i'll count 'm again .
so i smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time .
well , she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over , she was so mad .
but she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong .
then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest ; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us .
so we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was agiving us our sailing orders , and jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon .
we was very well satisfied with this business , and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took , because he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life ; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did ; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more .
so we put the sheet back on the line that night , and stole one out of her closet ; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more , and she didn't care , and warn't agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it , and wouldn't count them again not to save her life ; she druther die first .
so we was all right now , as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles , by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup counting ; and as to the candlestick , it warn't no consequence , it would blow over by and by .
but that pie was a job ; we had no end of trouble with that pie .
we fixed it up away down in the woods , and cooked it there ; and we got it done at last , and very satisfactory , too ; but not all in one day ; and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through , and we got burnt pretty much all over , in places , and eyes put out with the smoke ; because , you see , we didn't want nothing but a crust , and we couldn't prop it up right , and she would always cave in .
but of course we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie .
so then we laid in with jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with .
we let on it took nine months to make it .
and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it wouldn't go into the pie .
being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose .
we could a had a whole dinner .
but we didn't need it .
all we needed was just enough for the pie , and so we throwed the rest away .
we didn't cook none of the pies in the washpanafraid the solder would melt ; but uncle silas he had a noble brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of , because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable , not on account of being any account , because they warn't , but on account of them being relicts , you know , and we snaked her out , private , and took her down there , but she failed on the first pies , because we didn't know how , but she come up smiling on the last one .
we took and lined her with dough , and set her in the coals , and loaded her up with rag rope , and put on a dough roof , and shut down the lid , and put hot embers on top , and stood off five foot , with the long handle , cool and comfortable , and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at .
but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along , for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business i don't know nothing what i'm talking about , and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time , too .
nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in jim's pan ; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ; and so jim got everything all right , and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick , and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole .
making them pens was a distressid tough job , and so was the saw ; and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all .
that's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall .
but he had to have it ; tom said he'd got to ; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind , and his coat of arms .
look at lady jane grey , he says ; look at gilford dudley ; look at old northumberland !
why , huck , s'pose it is considerble trouble ?
whatyou going to do ?
howyou going to get around it ?
jim's got to do his inscription and coat of arms .
they all do .
jim says : why , mars tom , i hain't got no coat o' arm ; i hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt , en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat .
oh , you don't understand , jim ; a coat of arms is very different .
well , i says , jim's right , anyway , when he says he ain't got no coat of arms , because he hain't .
i reckon i knowed that , tom says , but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of thisbecause he's going out right , and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record .
so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , jim amaking his'n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon , tom set to work to think out the coat of arms .
by and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on .
he says : on the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base , a saltire murrey in the fess , with a dog , couchant , for common charge , and under his foot a chain embattled , for slavery , with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed , and three invected lines on a field azure , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ; crest , a runaway nigger , sable , with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ; and a couple of gules for supporters , which is you and me ; motto , maggiore fretta , minore otto .
got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed .
geewhillikins , i says , but what does the rest of it mean ?
we ain't got no time to bother over that , he says ; we got to dig in like all gitout .
well , anyway , i says , what's some of it ?
what's a fess ?
a fessa fess isyou don't need to know what a fess is .
i'll show him how to make it when he gets to it .
shucks , tom , i says , i think you might tell a person .
what's a bar sinister ?
oh , i don't know .
but he's got to have it .
all the nobility does .
that was just his way .
if it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you , he wouldn't do it .
you might pump at him a week , it wouldn't make no difference .
he'd got all that coat of arms business fixed , so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work , which was to plan out a mournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one , like they all done .
he made up a lot , and wrote them out on a paper , and read them off , so : 1 .
here a captive heart busted .
2 .
here a poor prisoner , forsook by the world and friends , fretted his sorrowful life .
3 .
here a lonely heart broke , and a worn spirit went to its rest , after thirtyseven years of solitary captivity .
4 .
here , homeless and friendless , after thirtyseven years of bitter captivity , perished a noble stranger , natural son of louis xiv .
tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them , and he most broke down .
when he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall , they was all so good ; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on .
jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail , and he didn't know how to make letters , besides ; but tom said he would block them out for him , and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines .
then pretty soon he says : come to think , the logs ain't agoing to do ; they don't have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock .
we'll fetch a rock .
jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out .
but tom said he would let me help him do it .
then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens .
it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we didn't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so tom says : i know how to fix it .
we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions , and we can kill two birds with that same rock .
there's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill , and we'll smouch it , and carve the things on it , and file out the pens and the saw on it , too .
it warn't no slouch of an idea ; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ; but we allowed we'd tackle it .
it warn't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill , leaving jim at work .
we smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job .
sometimes , do what we could , we couldn't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time .
tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through .
we got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat .
we see it warn't no use ; we got to go and fetch jim .
so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bedleg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and tom superintended .
he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see .
he knowed how to do everything .
our hole was pretty big , but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through ; but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough .
then tom marked out them things on it with the nail , and set jim to work on them , with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the leanto for a hammer , and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him , and then he could go to bed , and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it .
then we helped him fix his chain back on the bedleg , and was ready for bed ourselves .
but tom thought of something , and says : you got any spiders in here , jim ?
no , sah , thanks to goodness i hain't , mars tom .
all right , we'll get you some .
but bless you , honey , i doan' want none .
i's afeard un um .
i jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun' .
tom thought a minute or two , and says : it's a good idea .
and i reckon it's been done .
it must a been done ; it stands to reason .
yes , it's a prime good idea .
where could you keep it ?
keep what , mars tom ?
why , a rattlesnake .
de goodness gracious alive , mars tom !
why , if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah i'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall , i would , wid my head .
why , jim , you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little .
you could tame it .
tame it !
yeseasy enough .
every animal is grateful for kindness and petting , and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them .
any book will tell you that .
you trythat's all i ask ; just try for two or three days .
why , you can get him so , in a little while , that he'll love you ; and sleep with you ; and won't stay away from you a minute ; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth .
please , mars tomdoan' talk so !
i can't stan' it !
he'd let me shove his head in my mouffer a favor , hain't it ?
i lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' i ast him .
en mo' en dat , i doan' want him to sleep wid me .
jim , don't act so foolish .
a prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet , and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried , why , there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life .
why , mars tom , i doan' want no sich glory .
snake take 'n bite jim's chin off , den whah is de glory ?
no , sah , i doan' want no sich doin's .
blame it , can't you try ?
i only want you to tryyou needn't keep it up if it don't work .
but de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while i's a tryin' him .
mars tom , i's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable , but ef you en huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame , i's gwyne to leave , dat's shore .
well , then , let it go , let it go , if you're so bullheaded about it .
we can get you some gartersnakes , and you can tie some buttons on their tails , and let on they're rattlesnakes , and i reckon that 'll have to do .
i k'n stan' dem , mars tom , but blame' 'f i couldn' get along widout um , i tell you dat .
i never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner .
well , it always is when it's done right .
you got any rats around here ?
no , sah , i hain't seed none .
well , we'll get you some rats .
why , mars tom , i doan' want no rats .
dey's de dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body , en rustle roun' over 'im , en bite his feet , when he's tryin' to sleep , i ever see .
no , sah , gimme g'yartersnakes , 'f i's got to have 'm , but doan' gimme no rats ; i hain' got no use f'r um , skasely .
but , jim , you got to have 'emthey all do .
so don't make no more fuss about it .
prisoners ain't ever without rats .
there ain't no instance of it .
and they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies .
but you got to play music to them .
you got anything to play music on ?
i ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper , en a juiceharp ; but i reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juiceharp .
yes they wouldthey don't care what kind of music 'tis .
a jewsharp's plenty good enough for a rat .
all animals like musicin a prison they dote on it .
specially , painful music ; and you can't get no other kind out of a jewsharp .
it always interests them ; they come out to see what's the matter with you .
yes , you're all right ; you're fixed very well .
you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jewsharp ; play 'the last link is broken'that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else ; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come .
and they'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time .
yes , dey will , i reck'n , mars tom , but what kine er time is jim havin' ?
blest if i kin see de pint .
but i'll do it ef i got to .
i reck'n i better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house .
tom waited to think it over , and see if there wasn't nothing else ; and pretty soon he says : oh , there's one thing i forgot .
could you raise a flower here , do you reckon ?
i doan know but maybe i could , mars tom ; but it's tolable dark in heah , en i ain' got no use f'r no flower , nohow , en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble .
well , you try it , anyway .
some other prisoners has done it .
one er dem big cattaillookin' mullenstalks would grow in heah , mars tom , i reck'n , but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss .
don't you believe it .
we'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there , and raise it .
and don't call it mullen , call it pitchiolathat's its right name when it's in a prison .
and you want to water it with your tears .
why , i got plenty spring water , mars tom .
you don't want spring water ; you want to water it with your tears .
it's the way they always do .
why , mars tom , i lay i kin raise one er dem mullenstalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a start'n one wid tears .
that ain't the idea .
you got to do it with tears .
she'll die on my han's , mars tom , she sholy will ; kase i doan' skasely ever cry .
so tom was stumped .
but he studied it over , and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion .
he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one , private , in jim's coffeepot , in the morning .
jim said he would jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ; and found so much fault with it , and with the work and bother of raising the mullen , and jewsharping the rats , and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things , on top of all the other work he had to do on pens , and inscriptions , and journals , and things , which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook , that tom most lost all patience with him ; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself , and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them , and they was just about wasted on him .
so jim he was sorry , and said he wouldn't behave so no more , and then me and tom shoved for bed .
in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down , and unstopped the best rathole , and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sally's bed .
but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there , and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out , and they did ; and aunt sally she come in , and when we got back she was astanding on top of the bed raising cain , and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her .
so she took and dusted us both with the hickry , and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen , drat that meddlesome cub , and they warn't the likeliest , nuther , because the first haul was the pick of the flock .
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was .
we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet's nest , but we didn't .
the family was at home .
we didn't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out , and they done it .
then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but couldn't set down convenient .
and so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was suppertime , and a rattling good honest day's work : and hungry ?
oh ,no , i reckon not !
and there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didn't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left .
but it didn't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres .
so we judged we could get some of them again .
no , there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell .
you'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you didn't want them .
well , they was handsome and striped , and there warn't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to aunt sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it didn't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out .
i never see such a woman .
and you could hear her whoop to jericho .
you couldn't get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs .
and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire .
she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created .
why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warn't over it yet ; she warn't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings .
it was very curious .
but tom said all women was just so .
he said they was made that way for some reason or other .
we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them .
i didn't mind the lickings , because they didn't amount to nothing ; but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot .
but we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him .
jim didn't like the spiders , and the spiders didn't like jim ; and so they'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him .
and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him , skasely ; and when there was , a body couldn't sleep , it was so lively , and it was always lively , he said , because they never all slept at one time , but took turn about , so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck , and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch , so he always had one gang under him , in his way , and t'other gang having a circus over him , and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over .
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again , not for a salary .
well , by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape .
the shirt was sent in early , in a pie , and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh ; the pens was made , the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone ; the bedleg was sawed in two , and we had et up the sawdust , and it give us a most amazing stomachache .
we reckoned we was all going to die , but didn't .
it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see ; and tom said the same .
but as i was saying , we'd got all the work done now , at last ; and we was all pretty much fagged out , too , but mainly jim .
the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but hadn't got no answer , because there warn't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st .
louis and new orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the st .
louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and i see we hadn't no time to lose .
so tom said , now for the nonnamous letters .
what's them ?
i says .
warnings to the people that something is up .
sometimes it's done one way , sometimes another .
but there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle .
when louis xvi .
was going to light out of the tooleries , a servantgirl done it .
it's a very good way , and so is the nonnamous letters .
we'll use them both .
and it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him , and she stays in , and he slides out in her clothes .
we'll do that , too .
but looky here , tom , what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up ?
let them find it out for themselvesit's their lookout .
yes , i know ; but you can't depend on them .
it's the way they've acted from the very startleft us to do everything .
they're so confiding and mulletheaded they don't take notice of nothing at all .
so if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us , and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat ; won't amount to nothingwon't be nothing to it .
well , as for me , tom , that's the way i'd like .
shucks !
he says , and looked disgusted .
so i says : but i ain't going to make no complaint .
any way that suits you suits me .
what you going to do about the servantgirl ?
you'll be her .
you slide in , in the middle of the night , and hook that yaller girl's frock .
why , tom , that 'll make trouble next morning ; because , of course , she prob'bly hain't got any but that one .
i know ; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes , to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door .
all right , then , i'll do it ; but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs .
you wouldn't look like a servantgirl then , would you ?
no , but there won't be nobody to see what i look like , anyway .
that ain't got nothing to do with it .
the thing for us to do is just to do our duty , and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not .
hain't you got no principle at all ?
all right , i ain't saying nothing ; i'm the servantgirl .
who's jim's mother ?
i'm his mother .
i'll hook a gown from aunt sally .
well , then , you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves .
not much .
i'll stuff jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise , and jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it , and we'll all evade together .
when a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion .
it's always called so when a king escapes , f'rinstance .
and the same with a king's son ; it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one .
so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter , and i smouched the yaller wench's frock that night , and put it on , and shoved it under the front door , the way tom told me to .
it said : beware .
trouble is brewing .
keep a sharp lookout .
unknown friend .
next night we stuck a picture , which tom drawed in blood , of a skull and crossbones on the front door ; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door .
i never see a family in such a sweat .
they couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air .
if a door banged , aunt sally she jumped and said ouch !
if anything fell , she jumped and said ouch !
if you happened to touch her , when she warn't noticing , she done the same ; she couldn't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was always awhirling around sudden , and saying ouch , and before she'd got twothirds around she'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she dasn't set up .
so the thing was working very well , tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory .
he said it showed it was done right .
so he said , now for the grand bulge !
so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready , and was wondering what we better do with it , because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night .
tom he went down the lightningrod to spy around ; and the nigger at the back door was asleep , and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back .
this letter said : don't betray me , i wish to be your friend .
there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight , and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them .
i am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design .
they will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger's cabin to get him .
i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger ; but stead of that i will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure .
don't do anything but just the way i am telling you , if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo .
i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing .
unknown friend .
we was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river afishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but didn't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about halfpast eleven , and tom put on aunt sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : where's the butter ?
i laid out a hunk of it , i says , on a piece of a cornpone .
well , you left it laid out , thenit ain't here .
we can get along without it , i says .
we can get along with it , too , he says ; just you slide down cellar and fetch it .
and then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along .
i'll go and stuff the straw into jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise , and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there .
so out he went , and down cellar went i .
the hunk of butter , big as a person's fist , was where i had left it , so i took up the slab of cornpone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes aunt sally with a candle , and i clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : you been down cellar ?
yes'm .
what you been doing down there ?
noth'n .
noth'n !
no'm .
well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night ?
i don't know 'm .
you don't know ?
don't answer me that way .
tom , i want to know what you been doing down there .
i hain't been doing a single thing , aunt sally , i hope to gracious if i have .
i reckoned she'd let me go now , and as a generl thing she would ; but i s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yardstick straight ; so she says , very decided : you just march into that settingroom and stay there till i come .
you been up to something you no business to , and i lay i'll find out what it is before i'm done with you .
so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the settingroom .
my , but there was a crowd there !
fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun .
i was most powerful sick , and slunk to a chair and set down .
they was setting around , some of them talking a little , in a low voice , and all of them fidgety and uneasy , but trying to look like they warn't ; but i knowed they was , because they was always taking off their hats , and putting them on , and scratching their heads , and changing their seats , and fumbling with their buttons .
i warn't easy myself , but i didn't take my hat off , all the same .
i did wish aunt sally would come , and get done with me , and lick me , if she wanted to , and let me get away and tell tom how we'd overdone this thing , and what a thundering hornet'snest we'd got ourselves into , so we could stop fooling around straight off , and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us .
at last she come and begun to ask me questions , but i couldn't answer them straight , i didn't know which end of me was up ; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes , and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight ; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheepsignal ; and here was aunty pegging away at the questions , and me ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared ; and the place getting hotter and hotter , and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears ; and pretty soon , when one of them says , i'm for going and getting in the cabin first and right now , and catching them when they come , i most dropped ; and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead , and aunt sally she see it , and turns white as a sheet , and says : for the land's sake , what is the matter with the child ?
he's got the brainfever as shore as you're born , and they're oozing out !
and everybody runs to see , and she snatches off my hat , and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter , and she grabbed me , and hugged me , and says : oh , what a turn you did give me !
and how glad and grateful i am it ain't no worse ; for luck's against us , and it never rains but it pours , and when i see that truck i thought we'd lost you , for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be ifdear , dear , whyd'nt you tell me that was what you'd been down there for , i wouldn't a cared .
now cler out to bed , and don't lemme see no more of you till morning !
i was up stairs in a second , and down the lightningrod in another one , and shinning through the dark for the leanto .
i couldn't hardly get my words out , i was so anxious ; but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now , and not a minute to losethe house full of men , yonder , with guns !
his eyes just blazed ; and he says : no !
isthat so ?
ain't it bully !
why , huck , if it was to do over again , i bet i could fetch two hundred !
if we could put it off till hurry !
hurry !
i says .
where's jim ?
right at your elbow ; if you reach out your arm you can touch him .
he's dressed , and everything's ready .
now we'll slide out and give the sheepsignal .
but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door , and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock , and heard a man say : i told you we'd be too soon ; they haven't comethe door is locked .
here , i'll lock some of you into the cabin , and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come ; and the rest scatter around a piece , and listen if you can hear 'em coming .
so in they come , but couldn't see us in the dark , and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed .
but we got under all right , and out through the hole , swift but softjim first , me next , and tom last , which was according to tom's orders .
now we was in the leanto , and heard trampings close by outside .
so we crept to the door , and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack , but couldn't make out nothing , it was so dark ; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further , and when he nudged us jim must glide out first , and him last .
so he set his ear to the crack and listened , and listened , and listened , and the steps ascraping around out there all the time ; and at last he nudged us , and we slid out , and stooped down , not breathing , and not making the least noise , and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file , and got to it all right , and me and jim over it ; but tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail , and then he hear the steps coming , so he had to pull loose , which snapped the splinter and made a noise ; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out : who's that ?
answer , or i'll shoot !
but we didn't answer ; we just unfurled our heels and shoved .
then there was a rush , and a bang , bang , bang !
and the bullets fairly whizzed around us !
we heard them sing out : here they are !
they've broke for the river !
after 'em , boys , and turn loose the dogs !
so here they come , full tilt .
we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled , but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell .
we was in the path to the mill ; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by , and then dropped in behind them .
they'd had all the dogs shut up , so they wouldn't scare off the robbers ; but by this time somebody had let them loose , and here they come , making powwow enough for a million ; but they was our dogs ; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up ; and when they see it warn't nobody but us , and no excitement to offer them , they only just said howdy , and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering ; and then we upsteam again , and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill , and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied , and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river , but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to .
then we struck out , easy and comfortable , for the island where my raft was ; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank , till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out .
and when we stepped on to the raft i says : now , old jim , you're a free man again , and i bet you won't ever be a slave no more .
en a mighty good job it wuz , too , huck .
it 'uz planned beautiful , en it 'uz done beautiful ; en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz .
we was all glad as we could be , but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg .
when me and jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before .
it was hurting him considerable , and bleeding ; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him , but he says : gimme the rags ; i can do it myself .
don't stop now ; don't fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome ; man the sweeps , and set her loose !
boys , we done it elegant !
'deedwe did .
i wish we'd a had the handling of louis xvi .
 ,there wouldn't a been no 'son of saint louis , ascend to heaven !
'wrote down in his biography ; no , sir , we'd a whooped him over the borderthat's what we'd a done with himand done it just as slick as nothing at all , too .
man the sweepsman the sweeps !
but me and jim was consultingand thinking .
and after we'd thought a minute , i says : say it , jim .
so he says : well , den , dis is de way it look to me , huck .
ef it wuz him dat 'uz bein' sot free , en one er de boys wuz to git shot , would he say , 'go on en save me , nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one ?
'is dat like mars tom sawyer ?
would he say dat ?
you bet he wouldn't !
well , den , is jim gywne to say it ?
no , sahi doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a doctor , not if it's forty year !
i knowed he was white inside , and i reckoned he'd say what he did sayso it was all right now , and i told tom i was agoing for a doctor .
he raised considerable row about it , but me and jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we wouldn't let him .
then he give us a piece of his mind , but it didn't do no good .
so when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : well , then , if you're bound to go , i'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village .
shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast , and make him swear to be silent as the grave , and put a purse full of gold in his hand , and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark , and then fetch him here in the canoe , in a roundabout way amongst the islands , and search him and take his chalk away from him , and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village , or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again .
it's the way they all do .
so i said i would , and left , and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again .
the doctor was an old man ; a very nice , kindlooking old man when i got him up .
i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon , and camped on a piece of a raft we found , and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams , for it went off and shot him in the leg , and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it , nor let anybody know , because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks .
who is your folks ?
he says .
the phelpses , down yonder .
oh , he says .
and after a minute , he says : how'd you say he got shot ?
he had a dream , i says , and it shot him .
singular dream , he says .
so he lit up his lantern , and got his saddlebags , and we started .
but when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one , but didn't look pretty safe for two .
i says : oh , you needn't be afeard , sir , she carried the three of us easy enough .
what three ?
why , me and sid , andandand the guns ; that's what i mean .
oh , he says .
but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her , and shook his head , and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one .
but they was all locked and chained ; so he took my canoe , and said for me to wait till he come back , or i could hunt around further , or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to .
but i said i didn't ; so i told him just how to find the raft , and then he started .
i struck an idea pretty soon .
i says to myself , spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail , as the saying is ?
spos'n it takes him three or four days ?
what are we going to do ?
layaround there till he lets the cat out of the bag ?
no , sir ; i know what i'll do .
i'll wait , and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more i'll get down there , too , if i swim ; and we'll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river ; and when tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore .
so then i crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep ; and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head !
i shot out and went for the doctor's house , but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other , and warn't back yet .
well , thinks i , that looks powerful bad for tom , and i'll dig out for the island right off .
so away i shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into uncle silas's stomach !
he says : why , tom !
where you been all this time , you rascal ?
i hain't been nowheres , i says , only just hunting for the runaway niggerme and sid .
why , where ever did you go ?
he says .
your aunt's been mighty uneasy .
she needn't , i says , because we was all right .
we followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but couldn't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and sid's at the postoffice to see what he can hear , and i'm abranching out to get something to eat for us , and then we're going home .
so then we went to the postoffice to get sid ; but just as i suspicioned , he warn't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but sid didn't come ; so the old man said , come along , let sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling aroundbut we would ride .
i couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for sid ; and he said there warn't no use in it , and i must come along , and let aunt sally see we was all right .
when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks , and said she'd serve sid the same when he come .
and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard .
old mrs. hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was agoing all the time .
she says : well , sister phelps , i've ransacked thatair cabin over , an' i b'lieve the nigger was crazy .
i says to sister damrelldidn't i , sister damrell ?
s'i ,he's crazy , s'ithem's the very words i said .
you all hearn me : he's crazy , s'i ; everything shows it , s'i .
look at thatair grindstone , s'i ; want to tell me't any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone , s'i ?
here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart ; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirtyseven year , 'n' all thatnatcherl son o' louis somebody , 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage .
he's plumb crazy , s'i ; it's what i says in the fust place , it's what i says in the middle , 'n' it's what i says last 'n' all the timethe nigger's crazycrazy 's nebokoodneezer , s'i .
an' look at thatair ladder made out'n rags , sister hotchkiss , says old mrs. damrell ; what in the name o' goodness could he ever want of the very words i was asayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to sister utterback , 'n' she'll tell you so herself .
shshe , look at thatair rag ladder , shshe ; 'n' s'i , yes , look at it , s'iwhat could he awanted of it , s'i .
shshe , sister hotchkiss , shshe but how in the nation'd they ever git that grindstone in there , anyway ?
'n' who dug thatair hole ?
'n' who my very words , brer penrod !
i was asayin'pass thatair sasser o' m'lasses , won't ye ?
iwas asayin' to sister dunlap , jist this minute , how did they git that grindstone in there , s'i .
without help , mind you'thout help !
that's wher 'tis .
don't tell me , s'i ; there wuz help , s'i ; 'n' ther' wuz a plenty help , too , s'i ; ther's ben a dozen ahelpin' that nigger , 'n' i lay i'd skin every last nigger on this place but i'd find out who done it , s'i ; 'n' moreover , s'i a dozen says you !
fortycouldn't a done every thing that's been done .
look at them caseknife saws and things , how tedious they've been made ; look at that bedleg sawed off with 'm , a week's work for six men ; look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed ; and look at you may well say it , brer hightower !
it's jist as i was asayin' to brer phelps , his own self .
s'e , what do you think of it , sister hotchkiss , s'e ?
think o' what , brer phelps , s'i ?
think o' that bedleg sawed off that a way , s'e ?
think of it , s'i ?
i lay it never sawed itself off , s'isomebody sawed it , s'i ; that's my opinion , take it or leave it , it mayn't be no 'count , s'i , but sich as 't is , it's my opinion , s'i , 'n' if any body k'n start a better one , s'i , let him do it , s'i , that's all .
i says to sister dunlap , s'i why , dog my cats , they must a ben a housefull o' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work , sister phelps .
look at that shirtevery last inch of it kivered over with secret african writ'n done with blood !
must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along , all the time , amost .
why , i'd give two dollars to have it read to me ; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it , i 'low i'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll people to help him , brother marples !
well , i reckon you'd think so if you'd a been in this house for a while back .
why , they've stole everything they could lay their hands onand we awatching all the time , mind you .
they stole that shirt right off o' the line !
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of , ther' ain't no telling how many times they didn't steal that ; and flour , and candles , and candlesticks , and spoons , and the old warmingpan , and most a thousand things that i disremember now , and my new calico dress ; and me and silas and my sid and tom on the constant watch day and night , as i was atelling you , and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ; and here at the last minute , lo and behold you , they slides right in under our noses and fools us , and not only fools us but the injun territory robbers too , and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound , and that with sixteen men and twentytwo dogs right on their very heels at that very time !
i tell you , it just bangs anything i ever heard of .
why , sperits couldn't a done better and been no smarter .
and i reckon they must a been speritsbecause , you know our dogs , and ther' ain't no better ; well , them dogs never even got on the track of 'm once !
you explain that to me if you can !
anyof you !
well , it does beat laws alive , i never so help me , i wouldn't a be housethieves as well as goodnessgracioussakes , i'd a ben afeard to live in sich a 'fraid to live !
why ,i was that scared i dasn't hardly go to bed , or get up , or lay down , or set down , sister ridgeway .
why , they'd steal the verywhy , goodness sakes , you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night .
i hope to gracious if i warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family !
i was just to that pass i didn't have no reasoning faculties no more .
it looks foolish enough now , in the daytime ; but i says to myself , there's my two poor boys asleep , 'way up stairs in that lonesome room , and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy 't i crep' up there and locked 'em in !
i did .
and anybody would .
because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos'n i was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ain't locked , and you she stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk .
says i to myself , i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little .
so i done it .
but i dasn't go fur , or she'd a sent for me .
and when it was late in the day the people all went , and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid , and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightningrod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we didn't never want to try that no more .
and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before ; and then she said she'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harumscarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm hadn't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done .
so then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : why , lawsamercy , it's most night , and sid not come yet !
what has become of that boy ?
i see my chance ; so i skips up and says : i'll run right up to town and get him , i says .
no you won't , she says .
you'll stay right wher' you are ; one's enough to be lost at a time .
if he ain't here to supper , your uncle 'll go .
well , he warn't there to supper ; so right after supper uncle went .
he come back about ten a little bit uneasy ; hadn't run across tom's track .
aunt sally was a good deal uneasy ; but uncle silas he said there warn't no occasion to beboys will be boys , he said , and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right .
so she had to be satisfied .
but she said she'd set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it .
and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle , and tucked me in , and mothered me so good i felt mean , and like i couldn't look her in the face ; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time , and said what a splendid boy sid was , and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him ; and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost , or hurt , or maybe drownded , and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead , and she not by him to help him , and so the tears would drip down silent , and i would tell her that sid was all right , and would be home in the morning , sure ; and she would squeeze my hand , or maybe kiss me , and tell me to say it again , and keep on saying it , because it done her good , and she was in so much trouble .
and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle , and says : the door ain't going to be locked , tom , and there's the window and the rod ; but you'll be good , won't you ?
and you won't go ?
for my sake .
laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom , and was all intending to go ; but after that i wouldn't a went , not for kingdoms .
but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind , so i slept very restless .
and twice i went down the rod away in the night , and slipped around front , and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them ; and i wished i could do something for her , but i couldn't , only to swear that i wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more .
and the third time i waked up at dawn , and slid down , and she was there yet , and her candle was most out , and her old gray head was resting on her hand , and she was asleep .
the old man was uptown again before breakfast , but couldn't get no track of tom ; and both of them set at the table thinking , and not saying nothing , and looking mournful , and their coffee getting cold , and not eating anything .
and by and by the old man says : did i give you the letter ?
what letter ?
the one i got yesterday out of the postoffice .
no , you didn't give me no letter .
well , i must a forgot it .
so he rummaged his pockets , and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down , and fetched it , and give it to her .
she says : why , it's from st .
petersburgit's from sis .
i allowed another walk would do me good ; but i couldn't stir .
but before she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something .
and so did i .
it was tom sawyer on a mattress ; and that old doctor ; and jim , in her calico dress , with his hands tied behind him ; and a lot of people .
i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy , and rushed .
she flung herself at tom , crying , and says : oh , he's dead , he's dead , i know he's dead !
and tom he turned his head a little , and muttered something or other , which showed he warn't in his right mind ; then she flung up her hands , and says : he's alive , thank god !
and that's enough !
and she snatched a kiss of him , and flew for the house to get the bed ready , and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else , as fast as her tongue could go , every jump of the way .
i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim ; and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house .
the men was very huffy , and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there , so they wouldn't be trying to run away like jim done , and making such a raft of trouble , and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights .
but the others said , don't do it , it wouldn't answer at all ; he ain't our nigger , and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him , sure .
so that cooled them down a little , because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him .
they cussed jim considerble , though , and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while , but jim never said nothing , and he never let on to know me , and they took him to the same cabin , and put his own clothes on him , and chained him again , and not to no bedleg this time , but to a big staple drove into the bottom log , and chained his hands , too , and both legs , and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come , or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time , and filled up our hole , and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night , and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl goodbye cussing , and then the old doctor comes and takes a look , and says : don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to , because he ain't a bad nigger .
when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldn't cut the bullet out without some help , and he warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help ; and he got a little worse and a little worse , and after a long time he went out of his head , and wouldn't let me come anigh him any more , and said if i chalked his raft he'd kill me , and no end of wild foolishness like that , and i see i couldn't do anything at all with him ; so i says , i got to have help somehow ; and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help , and he done it , too , and done it very well .
of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger , and there i was !
and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night .
it was a fix , i tell you !
i had a couple of patients with the chills , and of course i'd of liked to run up to town and see them , but i dasn't , because the nigger might get away , and then i'd be to blame ; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail .
so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning ; and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller , and yet he was risking his freedom to do it , and was all tired out , too , and i see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately .
i liked the nigger for that ; i tell you , gentlemen , a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment , too .
i had everything i needed , and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter , maybe , because it was so quiet ; but there i was , with both of 'm on my hands , and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning ; then some men in a skiff come by , and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ; so i motioned them in quiet , and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about , and we never had no trouble .
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep , too , we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on , and towed her over very nice and quiet , and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start .
he ain't no bad nigger , gentlemen ; that's what i think about him .
somebody says : well , it sounds very good , doctor , i'm obleeged to say .
then the others softened up a little , too , and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn ; and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him .
then they all agreed that jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward .
so every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they wouldn't cuss him no more .
then they come out and locked him up .
i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off , because they was rotten heavy , or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ; but they didn't think of it , and i reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in , but i judged i'd get the doctor's yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as i'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of meexplanations , i mean , of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger .
but i had plenty time .
aunt sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night , and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him .
next morning i heard tom was a good deal better , and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap .
so i slips to the sickroom , and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash .
but he was sleeping , and sleeping very peaceful , too ; and pale , not firefaced the way he was when he come .
so i set down and laid for him to wake .
in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in , and there i was , up a stump again !
she motioned me to be still , and set down by me , and begun to whisper , and said we could all be joyful now , because all the symptoms was firstrate , and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long , and looking better and peacefuller all the time , and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind .
so we set there watching , and by and by he stirs a bit , and opened his eyes very natural , and takes a look , and says : hello !
why ,i'm at home !
how's that ?
where's the raft ?
it's all right , i says .
and jim ?
the same , i says , but couldn't say it pretty brash .
but he never noticed , but says : good !
splendid !
now we're all right and safe !
did you tell aunty ?
i was going to say yes ; but she chipped in and says : about what , sid ?
why , about the way the whole thing was done .
what whole thing ?
why , the whole thing .
there ain't but one ; how we set the runaway nigger freeme and tom .
good land !
set the runwhat is the child talking about !
dear , dear , out of his head again !
no , i ain't out of my head ; i know all what i'm talking about .
we did set him freeme and tom .
we laid out to do it , and we done it .
and we done it elegant , too .
he'd got a start , and she never checked him up , just set and stared and stared , and let him clip along , and i see it warn't no use for me to put in .
why , aunty , it cost us a power of workweeks of ithours and hours , every night , whilst you was all asleep .
and we had to steal candles , and the sheet , and the shirt , and your dress , and spoons , and tin plates , and caseknives , and the warmingpan , and the grindstone , and flour , and just no end of things , and you can't think what work it was to make the saws , and pens , and inscriptions , and one thing or another , and you can't think half the fun it was .
and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things , and nonnamous letters from the robbers , and get up and down the lightningrod , and dig the hole into the cabin , and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie , and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes !
and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on , for company for jim ; and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business , because the men come before we was out of the cabin , and we had to rush , and they heard us and let drive at us , and i got my share , and we dodged out of the path and let them go by , and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us , but went for the most noise , and we got our canoe , and made for the raft , and was all safe , and jim was a free man , and we done it all by ourselves , and wasn't it bully , aunty !
well , i never heard the likes of it in all my born days !
so it was you , you little rapscallions , that's been making all this trouble , and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death .
i've as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute .
to think , here i've been , night after night , ayou just get well once , you young scamp , and i lay i'll tan the old harry out o' both o' ye !
but tom , he was so proud and joyful , he just couldn't hold in , and his tongue just went itshe achipping in , and spitting fire all along , and both of them going it at once , like a cat convention ; and she says : well , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now , for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who ?
tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised .
with who ?
why , the runaway nigger , of course .
who'd you reckon ?
tom looks at me very grave , and says : tom , didn't you just tell me he was all right ?
hasn't he got away ?
him ?
says aunt sally ; the runaway nigger ?
'deed he hasn't .
they've got him back , safe and sound , and he's in that cabin again , on bread and water , and loaded down with chains , till he's claimed or sold !
tom rose square up in bed , with his eye hot , and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills , and sings out to me : they hain't no right to shut him up !
shove !
anddon't you lose a minute .
turn him loose !
he ain't no slave ; he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth !
what does the child mean ?
i mean every word i say , aunt sally , and if somebody don't go , i'll go .
i've knowed him all his life , and so has tom , there .
old miss watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and said so ; and she set him free in her will .
then what on earth did you want to set him free for , seeing he was already free ?
well , that is a question , i must say ; and just like women !
why , i wanted the adventure of it ; and i'd a waded neckdeep in blood togoodness alive , aunt polly !
if she warn't standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , i wish i may never !
aunt sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and i found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me .
and i peeped out , and in a little while tom's aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the earth , you know .
and then she says : yes , you better turn y'r head awayi would if i was you , tom .
oh , deary me !
says aunt sally ; is he changed so ?
why , that ain't tom , it's sid ; tom'stom'swhy , where is tom ?
he was here a minute ago .
you mean where's huck finnthat's what you mean !
i reckon i hain't raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him .
that would be a pretty howdydo .
come out from under that bed , huck finn .
so i done it .
but not feeling brash .
aunt sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons i ever seeexcept one , and that was uncle silas , when he come in and they told it all to him .
it kind of made him drunk , as you may say , and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day , and preached a prayermeeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation , because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it .
so tom's aunt polly , she told all about who i was , and what ; and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs. phelps took me for tom sawyershe chipped in and says , oh , go on and call me aunt sally , i'm used to it now , and 'tain't no need to changethat when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itthere warn't no other way , and i knowed he wouldn't mind , because it would be nuts for him , being a mystery , and he'd make an adventure out of it , and be perfectly satisfied .
and so it turned out , and he let on to be sid , and made things as soft as he could for me .
and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will ; and so , sure enough , tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free !
and i couldn't ever understand before , until that minute and that talk , how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup .
well , aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe , she says to herself : look at that , now !
i might have expected it , letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him .
so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river , eleven hundred mile , and find out what that creetur's up to this time , as long as i couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it .
why , i never heard nothing from you , says aunt sally .
well , i wonder !
why , i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here .
well , i never got 'em , sis .
aunt polly she turns around slow and severe , and says : you , tom !
wellwhat ?
he says , kind of pettish .
don't you what me , you impudent thinghand out them letters .
what letters ?
them letters .
i be bound , if i have to take aholt of you i'll they're in the trunk .
there , now .
and they're just the same as they was when i got them out of the office .
i hain't looked into them , i hain't touched them .
but i knowed they'd make trouble , and i thought if you warn't in no hurry , i'd well , you do need skinning , there ain't no mistake about it .
and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming ; and i s'pose he no , it come yesterday ; i hain't read it yet , but it's all right , i've got that one .
i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't , but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to .
so i never said nothing .
the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea , time of the evasion ?
whatit was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before ?
and he said , what he had planned in his head from the start , if we got jim out all safe , was for us to run him down the river on the raft , and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river , and then tell him about his being free , and take him back up home on a steamboat , in style , and pay him for his lost time , and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around , and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brassband , and then he would be a hero , and so would we .
but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was .
we had jim out of the chains in no time , and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do .
and we had him up to the sickroom , and had a high talk ; and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient , and doing it up so good , and jim was pleased most to death , and busted out , and says : dah , now , huck , what i tell you ?
whati tell you up dah on jackson islan' ?
i tole you i got a hairy breas' , en what's de sign un it ; en i tole you i ben rich wunst , en gwineter to be rich agin ; en it's come true ; en heah she is !
dah , now !
doan' talk to mesigns is signs , mine i tell you ; en i knowed jis' 's well 'at i 'uz gwineter be rich agin as i's astannin' heah dis minute !
and then tom he talked along and talked along , and says , le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit , and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns , over in the territory , for a couple of weeks or two ; and i says , all right , that suits me , but i ain't got no money for to buy the outfit , and i reckon i couldn't get none from home , because it's likely pap's been back before now , and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up .
no , he hain't , tom says ; it's all there yetsix thousand dollars and more ; and your pap hain't ever been back since .
hadn't when i come away , anyhow .
jim says , kind of solemn : he ain't acomin' back no mo' , huck .
i says : why , jim ?
nemmine why , huckbut he ain't comin' back no mo .
but i kept at him ; so at last he says : doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river , en dey wuz a man in dah , kivered up , en i went in en unkivered him and didn' let you come in ?
well , den , you kin git yo' money when you wants it , kase dat wuz him .
tom's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ain't nothing more to write about , and i am rotten glad of it , because if i'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldn't a tackled it , and ain't agoing to no more .
but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest , because aunt sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me , and i can't stand it .
i been there before .
the end .
yours truly , huck finn .
it was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of light , it was the season of darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to heaven , we were all going direct the other way in short , the period was so far like the present period , that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received , for good or for evil , in the superlative degree of comparison only .
there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face , on the throne of england ; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face , on the throne of france .
in both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes , that things in general were settled for ever .
it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive .
spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period , as at this .
mrs. southcott had recently attained her fiveandtwentieth blessed birthday , of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of london and westminster .
even the cocklane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years , after rapping out its messages , as the spirits of this very year last past supernaturally deficient in originality rapped out theirs .
mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people , from a congress of british subjects in america : which , strange to relate , have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cocklane brood .
france , less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident , rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill , making paper money and spending it .
under the guidance of her christian pastors , she entertained herself , besides , with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off , his tongue torn out with pincers , and his body burned alive , because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view , at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards .
it is likely enough that , rooted in the woods of france and norway , there were growing trees , when that sufferer was put to death , already marked by the woodman , fate , to come down and be sawn into boards , to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it , terrible in history .
it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris , there were sheltered from the weather that very day , rude carts , bespattered with rustic mire , snuffed about by pigs , and roosted in by poultry , which the farmer , death , had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution .
but that woodman and that farmer , though they work unceasingly , work silently , and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread : the rather , forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake , was to be atheistical and traitorous .
in england , there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting .
daring burglaries by armed men , and highway robberies , took place in the capital itself every night ; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security ; the highwayman in the dark was a city tradesman in the light , and , being recognised and challenged by his fellowtradesman whom he stopped in his character of the captain , gallantly shot him through the head and rode away ; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers , and the guard shot three dead , and then got shot dead himself by the other four , in consequence of the failure of his ammunition : after which the mail was robbed in peace ; that magnificent potentate , the lord mayor of london , was made to stand and deliver on turnham green , by one highwayman , who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue ; prisoners in london gaols fought battles with their turnkeys , and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them , loaded with rounds of shot and ball ; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at court drawingrooms ; musketeers went into st .
giles's , to search for contraband goods , and the mob fired on the musketeers , and the musketeers fired on the mob , and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way .
in the midst of them , the hangman , ever busy and ever worse than useless , was in constant requisition ; now , stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals ; now , hanging a housebreaker on saturday who had been taken on tuesday ; now , burning people in the hand at newgate by the dozen , and now burning pamphlets at the door of westminster hall ; today , taking the life of an atrocious murderer , and tomorrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence .
all these things , and a thousand like them , came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive .
environed by them , while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded , those two of the large jaws , and those other two of the plain and the fair faces , trod with stir enough , and carried their divine rights with a high hand .
thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive conduct their greatnesses , and myriads of small creaturesthe creatures of this chronicle among the restalong the roads that lay before them .
it was the dover road that lay , on a friday night late in november , before the first of the persons with whom this history has business .
the dover road lay , as to him , beyond the dover mail , as it lumbered up shooter's hill .
he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail , as the rest of the passengers did ; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise , under the circumstances , but because the hill , and the harness , and the mud , and the mail , were all so heavy , that the horses had three times already come to a stop , besides once drawing the coach across the road , with the mutinous intent of taking it back to blackheath .
reins and whip and coachman and guard , however , in combination , had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument , that some brute animals are endued with reason ; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty .
with drooping heads and tremulous tails , they mashed their way through the thick mud , floundering and stumbling between whiles , as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints .
as often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand , with a wary woho !
sohothen !
the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon itlike an unusually emphatic horse , denying that the coach could be got up the hill .
whenever the leader made this rattle , the passenger started , as a nervous passenger might , and was disturbed in mind .
there was a steaming mist in all the hollows , and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill , like an evil spirit , seeking rest and finding none .
a clammy and intensely cold mist , it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another , as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do .
it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coachlamps but these its own workings , and a few yards of road ; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it , as if they had made it all .
two other passengers , besides the one , were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail .
all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears , and wore jackboots .
not one of the three could have said , from anything he saw , what either of the other two was like ; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind , as from the eyes of the body , of his two companions .
in those days , travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice , for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers .
as to the latter , when every postinghouse and alehouse could produce somebody in the captain's pay , ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript , it was the likeliest thing upon the cards .
so the guard of the dover mail thought to himself , that friday night in november , one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive , lumbering up shooter's hill , as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail , beating his feet , and keeping an eye and a hand on the armchest before him , where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horsepistols , deposited on a substratum of cutlass .
the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers , the passengers suspected one another and the guard , they all suspected everybody else , and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses ; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the journey .
woho !
said the coachman .
so , then !
one more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you , for i have had trouble enough to get you to it !
joe !
halloa !
the guard replied .
what o'clock do you make it , joe ?
ten minutes , good , past eleven .
my blood !
ejaculated the vexed coachman , and not atop of shooter's yet !
tst !
yah !
get on with you !
the emphatic horse , cut short by the whip in a most decided negative , made a decided scramble for it , and the three other horses followed suit .
once more , the dover mail struggled on , with the jackboots of its passengers squashing along by its side .
they had stopped when the coach stopped , and they kept close company with it .
if any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness , he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman .
the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill .
the horses stopped to breathe again , and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent , and open the coachdoor to let the passengers in .
tst !
joe !
cried the coachman in a warning voice , looking down from his box .
what do you say , tom ?
they both listened .
i say a horse at a canter coming up , joe .
i say a horse at a gallop , tom , returned the guard , leaving his hold of the door , and mounting nimbly to his place .
gentlemen !
in the king's name , all of you !
with this hurried adjuration , he cocked his blunderbuss , and stood on the offensive .
the passenger booked by this history , was on the coachstep , getting in ; the two other passengers were close behind him , and about to follow .
he remained on the step , half in the coach and half out of ; they remained in the road below him .
they all looked from the coachman to the guard , and from the guard to the coachman , and listened .
the coachman looked back and the guard looked back , and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back , without contradicting .
the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach , added to the stillness of the night , made it very quiet indeed .
the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach , as if it were in a state of agitation .
the hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard ; but at any rate , the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath , and holding the breath , and having the pulses quickened by expectation .
the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill .
soho !
the guard sang out , as loud as he could roar .
yo there !
stand !
i shall fire !
the pace was suddenly checked , and , with much splashing and floundering , a man's voice called from the mist , is that the dover mail ?
never you mind what it is !
the guard retorted .
what are you ?
is that the dover mail ?
why do you want to know ?
i want a passenger , if it is .
what passenger ?
mr .
jarvis lorry .
our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name .
the guard , the coachman , and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully .
keep where you are , the guard called to the voice in the mist , because , if i should make a mistake , it could never be set right in your lifetime .
gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight .
what is the matter ?
asked the passenger , then , with mildly quavering speech .
who wants me ?
is it jerry ?
i don't like jerry's voice , if it is jerry , growled the guard to himself .
he's hoarser than suits me , is jerry .
yes , mr. lorry .
what is the matter ?
a despatch sent after you from over yonder .
t .
and co .
i know this messenger , guard , said mr. lorry , getting down into the roadassisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers , who immediately scrambled into the coach , shut the door , and pulled up the window .
he may come close ; there's nothing wrong .
i hope there ain't , but i can't make so 'nation sure of that , said the guard , in gruff soliloquy .
hallo you !
well !
and hallo you !
said jerry , more hoarsely than before .
come on at a footpace !
d'ye mind me ?
and if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn , don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em .
for i'm a devil at a quick mistake , and when i make one it takes the form of lead .
so now let's look at you .
the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist , and came to the side of the mail , where the passenger stood .
the rider stooped , and , casting up his eyes at the guard , handed the passenger a small folded paper .
the rider's horse was blown , and both horse and rider were covered with mud , from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man .
guard !
said the passenger , in a tone of quiet business confidence .
the watchful guard , with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss , his left at the barrel , and his eye on the horseman , answered curtly , sir .
there is nothing to apprehend .
i belong to tellson's bank .
you must know tellson's bank in london .
i am going to paris on business .
a crown to drink .
i may read this ?
if so be as you're quick , sir .
he opened it in the light of the coachlamp on that side , and readfirst to himself and then aloud : 'wait at dover for mam'selle .
'it's not long , you see , guard .
jerry , say that my answer was , recalled to life .
jerry started in his saddle .
that's a blazing strange answer , too , said he , at his hoarsest .
take that message back , and they will know that i received this , as well as if i wrote .
make the best of your way .
good night .
with those words the passenger opened the coachdoor and got in ; not at all assisted by his fellowpassengers , who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots , and were now making a general pretence of being asleep .
with no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action .
the coach lumbered on again , with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent .
the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his armchest , and , having looked to the rest of its contents , and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt , looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat , in which there were a few smith's tools , a couple of torches , and a tinderbox .
for he was furnished with that completeness that if the coachlamps had been blown and stormed out , which did occasionally happen , he had only to shut himself up inside , keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw , and get a light with tolerable safety and ease if he were lucky in five minutes .
tom !
softly over the coach roof .
hallo , joe .
did you hear the message ?
i did , joe .
what did you make of it , tom ?
nothing at all , joe .
that's a coincidence , too , the guard mused , for i made the same of it myself .
jerry , left alone in the mist and darkness , dismounted meanwhile , not only to ease his spent horse , but to wipe the mud from his face , and shake the wet out of his hatbrim , which might be capable of holding about half a gallon .
after standing with the bridle over his heavilysplashed arm , until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again , he turned to walk down the hill .
after that there gallop from temple bar , old lady , i won't trust your forelegs till i get you on the level , said this hoarse messenger , glancing at his mare .
'recalled to life .
'that's a blazing strange message .
much of that wouldn't do for you , jerry !
i say , jerry !
you'd be in a blazing bad way , if recalling to life was to come into fashion , jerry !
a wonderful fact to reflect upon , that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other .
a solemn consideration , when i enter a great city by night , that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret ; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret ; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there , is , in some of its imaginings , a secret to the heart nearest it !
something of the awfulness , even of death itself , is referable to this .
no more can i turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved , and vainly hope in time to read it all .
no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable water , wherein , as momentary lights glanced into it , i have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged .
it was appointed that the book should shut with a spring , for ever and for ever , when i had read but a page .
it was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost , when the light was playing on its surface , and i stood in ignorance on the shore .
my friend is dead , my neighbour is dead , my love , the darling of my soul , is dead ; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality , and which i shall carry in mine to my life's end .
in any of the burialplaces of this city through which i pass , is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are , in their innermost personality , to me , or than i am to them ?
as to this , his natural and not to be alienated inheritance , the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king , the first minister of state , or the richest merchant in london .
so with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach ; they were mysteries to one another , as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six , or his own coach and sixty , with the breadth of a county between him and the next .
the messenger rode back at an easy trot , stopping pretty often at alehouses by the way to drink , but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel , and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes .
he had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration , being of a surface black , with no depth in the colour or form , and much too near togetheras if they were afraid of being found out in something , singly , if they kept too far apart .
they had a sinister expression , under an old cockedhat like a threecornered spittoon , and over a great muffler for the chin and throat , which descended nearly to the wearer's knees .
when he stopped for drink , he moved this muffler with his left hand , only while he poured his liquor in with his right ; as soon as that was done , he muffled again .
no , jerry , no !
said the messenger , harping on one theme as he rode .
it wouldn't do for you , jerry .
jerry , you honest tradesman , it wouldn't suit your line of business !
recalled !
bust me if i don't think he'd been a drinking !
his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain , several times , to take off his hat to scratch his head .
except on the crown , which was raggedly bald , he had stiff , black hair , standing jaggedly all over it , and growing down hill almost to his broad , blunt nose .
it was so like smith's work , so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair , that the best of players at leapfrog might have declined him , as the most dangerous man in the world to go over .
while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of tellson's bank , by temple bar , who was to deliver it to greater authorities within , the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message , and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness .
they seemed to be numerous , for she shied at every shadow on the road .
what time , the mailcoach lumbered , jolted , rattled , and bumped upon its tedious way , with its three fellowinscrutables inside .
to whom , likewise , the shadows of the night revealed themselves , in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested .
tellson's bank had a run upon it in the mail .
as the bank passengerwith an arm drawn through the leathern strap , which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger , and driving him into his corner , whenever the coach got a special joltnodded in his place , with halfshut eyes , the little coachwindows , and the coachlamp dimly gleaming through them , and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger , became the bank , and did a great stroke of business .
the rattle of the harness was the chink of money , and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellson's , with all its foreign and home connection , ever paid in thrice the time .
then the strongrooms underground , at tellson's , with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger and it was not a little that he knew about them , opened before him , and he went in among them with the great keys and the feeblyburning candle , and found them safe , and strong , and sound , and still , just as he had last seen them .
but , though the bank was almost always with him , and though the coach in a confused way , like the presence of pain under an opiate was always with him , there was another current of impression that never ceased to run , all through the night .
he was on his way to dig some one out of a grave .
now , which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person , the shadows of the night did not indicate ; but they were all the faces of a man of fiveandforty by years , and they differed principally in the passions they expressed , and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state .
pride , contempt , defiance , stubbornness , submission , lamentation , succeeded one another ; so did varieties of sunken cheek , cadaverous colour , emaciated hands and figures .
but the face was in the main one face , and every head was prematurely white .
a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre : buried how long ?
the answer was always the same : almost eighteen years .
you had abandoned all hope of being dug out ?
long ago .
you know that you are recalled to life ?
they tell me so .
i hope you care to live ?
i can't say .
shall i show her to you ?
will you come and see her ?
the answers to this question were various and contradictory .
sometimes the broken reply was , wait !
it would kill me if i saw her too soon .
sometimes , it was given in a tender rain of tears , and then it was , take me to her .
sometimes it was staring and bewildered , and then it was , i don't know her .
i don't understand .
after such imaginary discourse , the passenger in his fancy would dig , and dig , dignow with a spade , now with a great key , now with his handsto dig this wretched creature out .
got out at last , with earth hanging about his face and hair , he would suddenly fan away to dust .
the passenger would then start to himself , and lower the window , to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek .
yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain , on the moving patch of light from the lamps , and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks , the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within .
the real bankinghouse by temple bar , the real business of the past day , the real strong rooms , the real express sent after him , and the real message returned , would all be there .
out of the midst of them , the ghostly face would rise , and he would accost it again .
buried how long ?
almost eighteen years .
i hope you care to live ?
i can't say .
digdigdiguntil an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window , draw his arm securely through the leathern strap , and speculate upon the two slumbering forms , until his mind lost its hold of them , and they again slid away into the bank and the grave .
buried how long ?
almost eighteen years .
you had abandoned all hope of being dug out ?
long ago .
the words were still in his hearing as just spokendistinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his lifewhen the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight , and found that the shadows of the night were gone .
he lowered the window , and looked out at the rising sun .
there was a ridge of ploughed land , with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked ; beyond , a quiet coppicewood , in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees .
though the earth was cold and wet , the sky was clear , and the sun rose bright , placid , and beautiful .
eighteen years !
said the passenger , looking at the sun .
gracious creator of day !
to be buried alive for eighteen years !
when the mail got successfully to dover , in the course of the forenoon , the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coachdoor as his custom was .
he did it with some flourish of ceremony , for a mail journey from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon .
by that time , there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated : for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations .
the mildewy inside of the coach , with its damp and dirty straw , its disagreeable smell , and its obscurity , was rather like a larger dogkennel .
mr. lorry , the passenger , shaking himself out of it in chains of straw , a tangle of shaggy wrapper , flapping hat , and muddy legs , was rather like a larger sort of dog .
there will be a packet to calais , tomorrow , drawer ?
yes , sir , if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair .
the tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon , sir .
bed , sir ?
i shall not go to bed till night ; but i want a bedroom , and a barber .
and then breakfast , sir ?
yes , sir .
that way , sir , if you please .
show concord !
gentleman's valise and hot water to concord .
pull off gentleman's boots in concord .
you will find a fine seacoal fire , sir .
fetch barber to concord .
stir about there , now , for concord !
the concord bedchamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail , and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot , the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the royal george , that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it , all kinds and varieties of men came out of it .
consequently , another drawer , and two porters , and several maids and the landlady , were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord and the coffeeroom , when a gentleman of sixty , formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes , pretty well worn , but very well kept , with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets , passed along on his way to his breakfast .
the coffeeroom had no other occupant , that forenoon , than the gentleman in brown .
his breakfasttable was drawn before the fire , and as he sat , with its light shining on him , waiting for the meal , he sat so still , that he might have been sitting for his portrait .
very orderly and methodical he looked , with a hand on each knee , and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat , as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire .
he had a good leg , and was a little vain of it , for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close , and were of a fine texture ; his shoes and buckles , too , though plain , were trim .
he wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig , setting very close to his head : which wig , it is to be presumed , was made of hair , but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass .
his linen , though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings , was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach , or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea .
a face habitually suppressed and quieted , was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner , in years gone by , some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of tellson's bank .
he had a healthy colour in his cheeks , and his face , though lined , bore few traces of anxiety .
but , perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellson's bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people ; and perhaps secondhand cares , like secondhand clothes , come easily off and on .
completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait , mr. lorry dropped off to sleep .
the arrival of his breakfast roused him , and he said to the drawer , as he moved his chair to it : i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time today .
she may ask for mr. jarvis lorry , or she may only ask for a gentleman from tellson's bank .
please to let me know .
yes , sir .
tellson's bank in london , sir ?
yes .
yes , sir .
we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris , sir .
a vast deal of travelling , sir , in tellson and company's house .
yes .
we are quite a french house , as well as an english one .
yes , sir .
not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , i think , sir ?
not of late years .
it is fifteen years since wesince icame last from france .
indeed , sir ?
that was before my time here , sir .
before our people's time here , sir .
the george was in other hands at that time , sir .
i believe so .
but i would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a house like tellson and company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago ?
you might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth .
indeed , sir !
rounding his mouth and both his eyes , as he stepped backward from the table , the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left , dropped into a comfortable attitude , and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank , as from an observatory or watchtower .
according to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages .
when mr. lorry had finished his breakfast , he went out for a stroll on the beach .
the little narrow , crooked town of dover hid itself away from the beach , and ran its head into the chalk cliffs , like a marine ostrich .
the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about , and the sea did what it liked , and what it liked was destruction .
it thundered at the town , and thundered at the cliffs , and brought the coast down , madly .
the air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it , as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea .
a little fishing was done in the port , and a quantity of strolling about by night , and looking seaward : particularly at those times when the tide made , and was near flood .
small tradesmen , who did no business whatever , sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes , and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter .
as the day declined into the afternoon , and the air , which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen , became again charged with mist and vapour , mr. lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too .
when it was dark , and he sat before the coffeeroom fire , awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast , his mind was busily digging , digging , digging , in the live red coals .
a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm , otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work .
mr. lorry had been idle a long time , and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street , and rumbled into the innyard .
he set down his glass untouched .
this is mam'selle !
said he .
in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette had arrived from london , and would be happy to see the gentleman from tellson's .
so soon ?
miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road , and required none then , and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellson's immediately , if it suited his pleasure and convenience .
the gentleman from tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation , settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears , and follow the waiter to miss manette's apartment .
it was a large , dark room , furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair , and loaded with heavy dark tables .
these had been oiled and oiled , until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf ; as if they were buried , in deep graves of black mahogany , and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out .
the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr. lorry , picking his way over the wellworn turkey carpet , supposed miss manette to be , for the moment , in some adjacent room , until , having got past the two tall candles , he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire , a young lady of not more than seventeen , in a ridingcloak , and still holding her straw travellinghat by its ribbon in her hand .
as his eyes rested on a short , slight , pretty figure , a quantity of golden hair , a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look , and a forehead with a singular capacity remembering how young and smooth it was , of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity , or wonder , or alarm , or merely of a bright fixed attention , though it included all the four expressionsas his eyes rested on these things , a sudden vivid likeness passed before him , of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very channel , one cold time , when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high .
the likeness passed away , like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pierglass behind her , on the frame of which , a hospital procession of negro cupids , several headless and all cripples , were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine genderand he made his formal bow to miss manette .
pray take a seat , sir .
in a very clear and pleasant young voice ; a little foreign in its accent , but a very little indeed .
i kiss your hand , miss , said mr. lorry , with the manners of an earlier date , as he made his formal bow again , and took his seat .
i received a letter from the bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligenceor discovery the word is not material , miss ; either word will do .
respecting the small property of my poor father , whom i never sawso long dead mr. lorry moved in his chair , and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids .
as if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets !
rendered it necessary that i should go to paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the bank , so good as to be despatched to paris for the purpose .
myself .
as i was prepared to hear , sir .
she curtseyed to him young ladies made curtseys in those days , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she .
he made her another bow .
i replied to the bank , sir , that as it was considered necessary , by those who know , and who are so kind as to advise me , that i should go to france , and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me , i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself , during the journey , under that worthy gentleman's protection .
the gentleman had left london , but i think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here .
i was happy , said mr. lorry , to be entrusted with the charge .
i shall be more happy to execute it .
sir , i thank you indeed .
i thank you very gratefully .
it was told me by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business , and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature .
i have done my best to prepare myself , and i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are .
naturally , said mr. lorry .
yesi after a pause , he added , again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears , it is very difficult to begin .
he did not begin , but , in his indecision , met her glance .
the young forehead lifted itself into that singular expressionbut it was pretty and characteristic , besides being singularand she raised her hand , as if with an involuntary action she caught at , or stayed some passing shadow .
are you quite a stranger to me , sir ?
am i not ?
mr. lorry opened his hands , and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile .
between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose , the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be , the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing .
he watched her as she mused , and the moment she raised her eyes again , went on : in your adopted country , i presume , i cannot do better than address you as a young english lady , miss manette ?
if you please , sir .
miss manette , i am a man of business .
i have a business charge to acquit myself of .
in your reception of it , don't heed me any more than if i was a speaking machinetruly , i am not much else .
i will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers .
story !
he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated , when he added , in a hurry , yes , customers ; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers .
he was a french gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirementsa doctor .
not of beauvais ?
why , yes , of beauvais .
like monsieur manette , your father , the gentleman was of beauvais .
like monsieur manette , your father , the gentleman was of repute in paris .
i had the honour of knowing him there .
our relations were business relations , but confidential .
i was at that time in our french house , and had beenoh !
twenty years .
at that timei may ask , at what time , sir ?
i speak , miss , of twenty years ago .
he marriedan english ladyand i was one of the trustees .
his affairs , like the affairs of many other french gentlemen and french families , were entirely in tellson's hands .
in a similar way i am , or i have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers .
these are mere business relations , miss ; there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment .
i have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as i pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day ; in short , i have no feelings ; i am a mere machine .
to go on but this is my father's story , sir ; and i begin to thinkthe curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon himthat when i was left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to england .
i am almost sure it was you .
mr. lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his , and he put it with some ceremony to his lips .
he then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again , and , holding the chairback with his left hand , and using his right by turns to rub his chin , pull his wig at the ears , or point what he said , stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his .
miss manette , it was i .
and you will see how truly i spoke of myself just now , in saying i had no feelings , and that all the relations i hold with my fellowcreatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that i have never seen you since .
no ; you have been the ward of tellson's house since , and i have been busy with the other business of tellson's house since .
feelings !
i have no time for them , no chance of them .
i pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary mangle .
after this odd description of his daily routine of employment , mr. lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands which was most unnecessary , for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before , and resumed his former attitude .
so far , miss as you have remarked , this is the story of your regretted father .
now comes the difference .
if your father had not died when he diddon't be frightened !
how you start !
she did , indeed , start .
and she caught his wrist with both her hands .
pray , said mr. lorry , in a soothing tone , bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble : pray control your agitationa matter of business .
as i was saying her look so discomposed him that he stopped , wandered , and began anew : as i was saying ; if monsieur manette had not died ; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ; if he had been spirited away ; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place , though no art could trace him ; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper , across the water there ; for instance , the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time ; if his wife had implored the king , the queen , the court , the clergy , for any tidings of him , and all quite in vain ;then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman , the doctor of beauvais .
i entreat you to tell me more , sir .
i will .
i am going to .
you can bear it ?
i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment .
you speak collectedly , and youare collected .
that's good !
though his manner was less satisfied than his words .
a matter of business .
regard it as a matter of businessbusiness that must be done .
now if this doctor's wife , though a lady of great courage and spirit , had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born the little child was a daughter , sir .
a daughter .
aamatter of businessdon't be distressed .
miss , if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born , that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of , by rearing her in the belief that her father was deadno , don't kneel !
in heaven's name why should you kneel to me !
for the truth .
o dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth !
aa matter of business .
you confuse me , and how can i transact business if i am confused ?
let us be clearheaded .
if you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging .
i should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind .
without directly answering to this appeal , she sat so still when he had very gently raised her , and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been , that she communicated some reassurance to mr. jarvis lorry .
that's right , that's right .
courage !
business !
you have business before you ; useful business .
miss manette , your mother took this course with you .
and when she diedi believe brokenheartedhaving never slackened her unavailing search for your father , she left you , at two years old , to grow to be blooming , beautiful , and happy , without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison , or wasted there through many lingering years .
as he said the words he looked down , with an admiring pity , on the flowing golden hair ; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey .
you know that your parents had no great possession , and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you .
there has been no new discovery , of money , or of any other property ; but he felt his wrist held closer , and he stopped .
the expression in the forehead , which had so particularly attracted his notice , and which was now immovable , had deepened into one of pain and horror .
but he has beenbeen found .
he is alive .
greatly changed , it is too probable ; almost a wreck , it is possible ; though we will hope the best .
still , alive .
your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris , and we are going there : i , to identify him if i can : you , to restore him to life , love , duty , rest , comfort .
a shiver ran through her frame , and from it through his .
she said , in a low , distinct , awestricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream , i am going to see his ghost !
it will be his ghostnot him !
mr. lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm .
there , there , there !
see now , see now !
the best and the worst are known to you , now .
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side .
she repeated in the same tone , sunk to a whisper , i have been free , i have been happy , yet his ghost has never haunted me !
only one thing more , said mr. lorry , laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention : he has been found under another name ; his own , long forgotten or long concealed .
it would be worse than useless now to inquire which ; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked , or always designedly held prisoner .
it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries , because it would be dangerous .
better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way , and to remove himfor a while at all eventsout of france .
even i , safe as an englishman , and even tellson's , important as they are to french credit , avoid all naming of the matter .
i carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it .
this is a secret service altogether .
my credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , 'recalled to life ;' which may mean anything .
but what is the matter !
she doesn't notice a word !
miss manette !
perfectly still and silent , and not even fallen back in her chair , she sat under his hand , utterly insensible ; with her eyes open and fixed upon him , and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead .
so close was her hold upon his arm , that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her ; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving .
a wildlooking woman , whom even in his agitation , mr. lorry observed to be all of a red colour , and to have red hair , and to be dressed in some extraordinary tightfitting fashion , and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure , and good measure too , or a great stilton cheese , came running into the room in advance of the inn servants , and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady , by laying a brawny hand upon his chest , and sending him flying back against the nearest wall .
i really think this must be a man !
was mr. lorry's breathless reflection , simultaneously with his coming against the wall .
why , look at you all !
bawled this figure , addressing the inn servants .
why don't you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me ?
i am not so much to look at , am i ?
why don't you go and fetch things ?
i'll let you know , if you don't bring smellingsalts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , i will .
there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives , and she softly laid the patient on a sofa , and tended her with great skill and gentleness : calling her my precious !
and my bird !
and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care .
and you in brown !
she said , indignantly turning to mr. lorry ; couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her , without frightening her to death ?
look at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands .
do you call that being a banker ?
mr. lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer , that he could only look on , at a distance , with much feebler sympathy and humility , while the strong woman , having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of letting them know something not mentioned if they stayed there , staring , recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations , and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder .
i hope she will do well now , said mr. lorry .
no thanks to you in brown , if she does .
my darling pretty !
i hope , said mr. lorry , after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility , that you accompany miss manette to france ?
a likely thing , too !
replied the strong woman .
if it was ever intended that i should go across salt water , do you suppose providence would have cast my lot in an island ?
this being another question hard to answer , mr. jarvis lorry withdrew to consider it .
a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken , in the street .
the accident had happened in getting it out of a cart ; the cask had tumbled out with a run , the hoops had burst , and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wineshop , shattered like a walnutshell .
all the people within reach had suspended their business , or their idleness , to run to the spot and drink the wine .
the rough , irregular stones of the street , pointing every way , and designed , one might have thought , expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them , had dammed it into little pools ; these were surrounded , each by its own jostling group or crowd , according to its size .
some men kneeled down , made scoops of their two hands joined , and sipped , or tried to help women , who bent over their shoulders , to sip , before the wine had all run out between their fingers .
others , men and women , dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware , or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads , which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths ; others made small mudembankments , to stem the wine as it ran ; others , directed by lookerson up at high windows , darted here and there , to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions ; others devoted themselves to the sodden and leedyed pieces of the cask , licking , and even champing the moister winerotted fragments with eager relish .
there was no drainage to carry off the wine , and not only did it all get taken up , but so much mud got taken up along with it , that there might have been a scavenger in the street , if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence .
a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voicesvoices of men , women , and childrenresounded in the street while this wine game lasted .
there was little roughness in the sport , and much playfulness .
there was a special companionship in it , an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one , which led , especially among the luckier or lighterhearted , to frolicsome embraces , drinking of healths , shaking of hands , and even joining of hands and dancing , a dozen together .
when the wine was gone , and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridironpattern by fingers , these demonstrations ceased , as suddenly as they had broken out .
the man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting , set it in motion again ; the women who had left on a doorstep the little pot of hot ashes , at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes , or in those of her child , returned to it ; men with bare arms , matted locks , and cadaverous faces , who had emerged into the winter light from cellars , moved away , to descend again ; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine .
the wine was red wine , and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of saint antoine , in paris , where it was spilled .
it had stained many hands , too , and many faces , and many naked feet , and many wooden shoes .
the hands of the man who sawed the wood , left red marks on the billets ; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby , was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again .
those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask , had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth ; and one tall joker so besmirched , his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it , scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wineleesblood .
the time was to come , when that wine too would be spilled on the streetstones , and when the stain of it would be red upon many there .
and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine , which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance , the darkness of it was heavycold , dirt , sickness , ignorance , and want , were the lords in waiting on the saintly presencenobles of great power all of them ; but , most especially the last .
samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill , and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young , shivered at every corner , passed in and out at every doorway , looked from every window , fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook .
the mill which had worked them down , was the mill that grinds young people old ; the children had ancient faces and grave voices ; and upon them , and upon the grown faces , and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh , was the sigh , hunger .
it was prevalent everywhere .
hunger was pushed out of the tall houses , in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines ; hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper ; hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off ; hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys , and started up from the filthy street that had no offal , among its refuse , of anything to eat .
hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves , written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread ; at the sausageshop , in every deaddog preparation that was offered for sale .
hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder ; hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato , fried with some reluctant drops of oil .
its abiding place was in all things fitted to it .
a narrow winding street , full of offence and stench , with other narrow winding streets diverging , all peopled by rags and nightcaps , and all smelling of rags and nightcaps , and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill .
in the hunted air of the people there was yet some wildbeast thought of the possibility of turning at bay .
depressed and slinking though they were , eyes of fire were not wanting among them ; nor compressed lips , white with what they suppressed ; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallowsrope they mused about enduring , or inflicting .
the trade signs and they were almost as many as the shops were , all , grim illustrations of want .
the butcher and the porkman painted up , only the leanest scrags of meat ; the baker , the coarsest of meagre loaves .
the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wineshops , croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer , and were gloweringly confidential together .
nothing was represented in a flourishing condition , save tools and weapons ; but , the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and bright , the smith's hammers were heavy , and the gunmaker's stock was murderous .
the crippling stones of the pavement , with their many little reservoirs of mud and water , had no footways , but broke off abruptly at the doors .
the kennel , to make amends , ran down the middle of the streetwhen it ran at all : which was only after heavy rains , and then it ran , by many eccentric fits , into the houses .
across the streets , at wide intervals , one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley ; at night , when the lamplighter had let these down , and lighted , and hoisted them again , a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead , as if they were at sea .
indeed they were at sea , and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest .
for , the time was to come , when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter , in their idleness and hunger , so long , as to conceive the idea of improving on his method , and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys , to flare upon the darkness of their condition .
but , the time was not come yet ; and every wind that blew over france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain , for the birds , fine of song and feather , took no warning .
the wineshop was a corner shop , better than most others in its appearance and degree , and the master of the wineshop had stood outside it , in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches , looking on at the struggle for the lost wine .
it's not my affair , said he , with a final shrug of the shoulders .
the people from the market did it .
let them bring another .
there , his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke , he called to him across the way : say , then , my gaspard , what do you do there ?
the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance , as is often the way with his tribe .
it missed its mark , and completely failed , as is often the way with his tribe too .
what now ?
are you a subject for the mad hospital ?
said the wineshop keeper , crossing the road , and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud , picked up for the purpose , and smeared over it .
why do you write in the public streets ?
is theretell me thouis there no other place to write such words in ?
in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand perhaps accidentally , perhaps not upon the joker's heart .
the joker rapped it with his own , took a nimble spring upward , and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude , with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out .
a joker of an extremely , not to say wolfishly practical character , he looked , under those circumstances .
put it on , put it on , said the other .
call wine , wine ; and finish there .
with that advice , he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's dress , such as it wasquite deliberately , as having dirtied the hand on his account ; and then recrossed the road and entered the wineshop .
this wineshop keeper was a bullnecked , martiallooking man of thirty , and he should have been of a hot temperament , for , although it was a bitter day , he wore no coat , but carried one slung over his shoulder .
his shirtsleeves were rolled up , too , and his brown arms were bare to the elbows .
neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisplycurling short dark hair .
he was a dark man altogether , with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them .
goodhumoured looking on the whole , but implacablelooking , too ; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose ; a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side , for nothing would turn the man .
madame defarge , his wife , sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in .
madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age , with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything , a large hand heavily ringed , a steady face , strong features , and great composure of manner .
there was a character about madame defarge , from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided .
madame defarge being sensitive to cold , was wrapped in fur , and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head , though not to the concealment of her large earrings .
her knitting was before her , but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick .
thus engaged , with her right elbow supported by her left hand , madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in , but coughed just one grain of cough .
this , in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line , suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers , for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way .
the wineshop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about , until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady , who were seated in a corner .
other company were there : two playing cards , two playing dominoes , three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine .
as he passed behind the counter , he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady , this is our man .
what the devil do you do in that galley there ?
said monsieur defarge to himself ; i don't know you .
but , he feigned not to notice the two strangers , and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter .
how goes it , jacques ?
said one of these three to monsieur defarge .
is all the spilt wine swallowed ?
every drop , jacques , answered monsieur defarge .
when this interchange of christian name was effected , madame defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
it is not often , said the second of the three , addressing monsieur defarge , that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death .
is it not so , jacques ?
it is so , jacques , monsieur defarge returned .
at this second interchange of the christian name , madame defarge , still using her toothpick with profound composure , coughed another grain of cough , and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line .
the last of the three now said his say , as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips .
ah !
so much the worse !
a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , jacques .
am i right , jacques ?
you are right , jacques , was the response of monsieur defarge .
this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by , kept her eyebrows up , and slightly rustled in her seat .
hold then !
true !
muttered her husband .
gentlemenmy wife !
the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge , with three flourishes .
she acknowledged their homage by bending her head , and giving them a quick look .
then she glanced in a casual manner round the wineshop , took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit , and became absorbed in it .
gentlemen , said her husband , who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her , good day .
the chamber , furnished bachelorfashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when i stepped out , is on the fifth floor .
the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , pointing with his hand , near to the window of my establishment .
but , now that i remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way .
gentlemen , adieu !
they paid for their wine , and left the place .
the eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner , and begged the favour of a word .
willingly , sir , said monsieur defarge , and quietly stepped with him to the door .
their conference was very short , but very decided .
almost at the first word , monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive .
it had not lasted a minute , when he nodded and went out .
the gentleman then beckoned to the young lady , and they , too , went out .
madame defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows , and saw nothing .
mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette , emerging from the wineshop thus , joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before .
it opened from a stinking little black courtyard , and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses , inhabited by a great number of people .
in the gloomy tilepaved entry to the gloomy tilepaved staircase , monsieur defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master , and put her hand to his lips .
it was a gentle action , but not at all gently done ; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds .
he had no goodhumour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left , but had become a secret , angry , dangerous man .
it is very high ; it is a little difficult .
better to begin slowly .
thus , monsieur defarge , in a stern voice , to mr. lorry , as they began ascending the stairs .
is he alone ?
the latter whispered .
alone !
god help him , who should be with him !
said the other , in the same low voice .
is he always alone , then ?
yes .
of his own desire ?
of his own necessity .
as he was , when i first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if i would take him , and , at my peril be discreetas he was then , so he is now .
he is greatly changed ?
changed !
the keeper of the wineshop stopped to strike the wall with his hand , and mutter a tremendous curse .
no direct answer could have been half so forcible .
mr. lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier , as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher .
such a staircase , with its accessories , in the older and more crowded parts of paris , would be bad enough now ; but , at that time , it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses .
every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high buildingthat is to say , the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircaseleft its own heap of refuse on its own landing , besides flinging other refuse from its own windows .
the uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered , would have polluted the air , even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities ; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable .
through such an atmosphere , by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison , the way lay .
yielding to his own disturbance of mind , and to his young companion's agitation , which became greater every instant , mr. jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest .
each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating , by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted , seemed to escape , and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in .
through the rusted bars , tastes , rather than glimpses , were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood ; and nothing within range , nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notredame , had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations .
at last , the top of the staircase was gained , and they stopped for the third time .
there was yet an upper staircase , of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions , to be ascended , before the garret story was reached .
the keeper of the wineshop , always going a little in advance , and always going on the side which mr. lorry took , as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady , turned himself about here , and , carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder , took out a key .
the door is locked then , my friend ?
said mr. lorry , surprised .
ay .
yes , was the grim reply of monsieur defarge .
you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ?
i think it necessary to turn the key .
monsieur defarge whispered it closer in his ear , and frowned heavily .
why ?
why !
because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightenedravetear himself to piecesdiecome to i know not what harmif his door was left open .
is it possible !
exclaimed mr. lorry .
is it possible !
repeated defarge , bitterly .
yes .
and a beautiful world we live in , when it is possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but donedone , see you !
underthat sky there , every day .
long live the devil .
let us go on .
this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper , that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears .
but , by this time she trembled under such strong emotion , and her face expressed such deep anxiety , and , above all , such dread and terror , that mr. lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance .
courage , dear miss !
courage !
business !
the worst will be over in a moment ; it is but passing the roomdoor , and the worst is over .
then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin .
let our good friend here , assist you on that side .
that's well , friend defarge .
come , now .
business , business !
they went up slowly and softly .
the staircase was short , and they were soon at the top .
there , as it had an abrupt turn in it , they came all at once in sight of three men , whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door , and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged , through some chinks or holes in the wall .
on hearing footsteps close at hand , these three turned , and rose , and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wineshop .
i forgot them in the surprise of your visit , explained monsieur defarge .
leave us , good boys ; we have business here .
the three glided by , and went silently down .
there appearing to be no other door on that floor , and the keeper of the wineshop going straight to this one when they were left alone , mr. lorry asked him in a whisper , with a little anger : do you make a show of monsieur manette ?
i show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few .
is that well ?
i think it is well .
who are the few ?
how do you choose them ?
i choose them as real men , of my namejacques is my nameto whom the sight is likely to do good .
enough ; you are english ; that is another thing .
stay there , if you please , a little moment .
with an admonitory gesture to keep them back , he stooped , and looked in through the crevice in the wall .
soon raising his head again , he struck twice or thrice upon the doorevidently with no other object than to make a noise there .
with the same intention , he drew the key across it , three or four times , before he put it clumsily into the lock , and turned it as heavily as he could .
the door slowly opened inward under his hand , and he looked into the room and said something .
a faint voice answered something .
little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side .
he looked back over his shoulder , and beckoned them to enter .
mr. lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's waist , and held her ; for he felt that she was sinking .
aaabusiness , business !
he urged , with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek .
come in , come in !
i am afraid of it , she answered , shuddering .
of it ?
what ?
i mean of him .
of my father .
rendered in a manner desperate , by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor , he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder , lifted her a little , and hurried her into the room .
he sat her down just within the door , and held her , clinging to him .
defarge drew out the key , closed the door , locked it on the inside , took out the key again , and held it in his hand .
all this he did , methodically , and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make .
finally , he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was .
he stopped there , and faced round .
the garret , built to be a depository for firewood and the like , was dim and dark : for , the window of dormer shape , was in truth a door in the roof , with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street : unglazed , and closing up the middle in two pieces , like any other door of french construction .
to exclude the cold , one half of this door was fast closed , and the other was opened but a very little way .
such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means , that it was difficult , on first coming in , to see anything ; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one , the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity .
yet , work of that kind was being done in the garret ; for , with his back towards the door , and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wineshop stood looking at him , a whitehaired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes .
good day !
said monsieur defarge , looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking .
it was raised for a moment , and a very faint voice responded to the salutation , as if it were at a distance : good day !
you are still hard at work , i see ?
after a long silence , the head was lifted for another moment , and the voice replied , yesi am working .
this time , a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner , before the face had dropped again .
the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful .
it was not the faintness of physical weakness , though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it .
its deplorable peculiarity was , that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse .
it was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago .
so entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice , that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain .
so sunken and suppressed it was , that it was like a voice underground .
so expressive it was , of a hopeless and lost creature , that a famished traveller , wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness , would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die .
some minutes of silent work had passed : and the haggard eyes had looked up again : not with any interest or curiosity , but with a dull mechanical perception , beforehand , that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood , was not yet empty .
i want , said defarge , who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker , to let in a little more light here .
you can bear a little more ?
the shoemaker stopped his work ; looked with a vacant air of listening , at the floor on one side of him ; then similarly , at the floor on the other side of him ; then , upward at the speaker .
what did you say ?
you can bear a little more light ?
i must bear it , if you let it in .
laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word .
the opened halfdoor was opened a little further , and secured at that angle for the time .
a broad ray of light fell into the garret , and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap , pausing in his labour .
his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench .
he had a white beard , raggedly cut , but not very long , a hollow face , and exceedingly bright eyes .
the hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large , under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair , though they had been really otherwise ; but , they were naturally large , and looked unnaturally so .
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat , and showed his body to be withered and worn .
he , and his old canvas frock , and his loose stockings , and all his poor tatters of clothes , had , in a long seclusion from direct light and air , faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchmentyellow , that it would have been hard to say which was which .
he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light , and the very bones of it seemed transparent .
so he sat , with a steadfastly vacant gaze , pausing in his work .
he never looked at the figure before him , without first looking down on this side of himself , then on that , as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound ; he never spoke , without first wandering in this manner , and forgetting to speak .
are you going to finish that pair of shoes today ?
asked defarge , motioning to mr. lorry to come forward .
what did you say ?
do you mean to finish that pair of shoes today ?
i can't say that i mean to .
i suppose so .
i don't know .
but , the question reminded him of his work , and he bent over it again .
mr. lorry came silently forward , leaving the daughter by the door .
when he had stood , for a minute or two , by the side of defarge , the shoemaker looked up .
he showed no surprise at seeing another figure , but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it his lips and his nails were of the same pale leadcolour , and then the hand dropped to his work , and he once more bent over the shoe .
the look and the action had occupied but an instant .
you have a visitor , you see , said monsieur defarge .
what did you say ?
here is a visitor .
the shoemaker looked up as before , but without removing a hand from his work .
come !
said defarge .
here is monsieur , who knows a wellmade shoe when he sees one .
show him that shoe you are working at .
take it , monsieur .
mr. lorry took it in his hand .
tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker's name .
there was a longer pause than usual , before the shoemaker replied : i forget what it was you asked me .
what did you say ?
i said , couldn't you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur's information ?
it is a lady's shoe .
it is a young lady's walkingshoe .
it is in the present mode .
i never saw the mode .
i have had a pattern in my hand .
he glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride .
and the maker's name ?
said defarge .
now that he had no work to hold , he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left , and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right , and then passed a hand across his bearded chin , and so on in regular changes , without a moment's intermission .
the task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken , was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon , or endeavouring , in the hope of some disclosure , to stay the spirit of a fastdying man .
did you ask me for my name ?
assuredly i did .
one hundred and five , north tower .
is that all ?
one hundred and five , north tower .
with a weary sound that was not a sigh , nor a groan , he bent to work again , until the silence was again broken .
you are not a shoemaker by trade ?
said mr. lorry , looking steadfastly at him .
his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him : but as no help came from that quarter , they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground .
i am not a shoemaker by trade ?
no , i was not a shoemaker by trade .
ii learnt it here .
i taught myself .
i asked leave to he lapsed away , even for minutes , ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time .
his eyes came slowly back , at last , to the face from which they had wandered ; when they rested on it , he started , and resumed , in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake , reverting to a subject of last night .
i asked leave to teach myself , and i got it with much difficulty after a long while , and i have made shoes ever since .
as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him , mr. lorry said , still looking steadfastly in his face : monsieur manette , do you remember nothing of me ?
the shoe dropped to the ground , and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner .
monsieur manette ; mr. lorry laid his hand upon defarge's arm ; do you remember nothing of this man ?
look at him .
look at me .
is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , monsieur manette ?
as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly , by turns , at mr. lorry and at defarge , some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead , gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him .
they were overclouded again , they were fainter , they were gone ; but they had been there .
and so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him , and where she now stood looking at him , with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion , if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him , but which were now extending towards him , trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast , and love it back to life and hopeso exactly was the expression repeated though in stronger characters on her fair young face , that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light , from him to her .
darkness had fallen on him in its place .
he looked at the two , less and less attentively , and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way .
finally , with a deep long sigh , he took the shoe up , and resumed his work .
have you recognised him , monsieur ?
asked defarge in a whisper .
yes ; for a moment .
at first i thought it quite hopeless , but i have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that i once knew so well .
hush !
let us draw further back .
hush !
she had moved from the wall of the garret , very near to the bench on which he sat .
there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour .
not a word was spoken , not a sound was made .
she stood , like a spirit , beside him , and he bent over his work .
it happened , at length , that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand , for his shoemaker's knife .
it lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood .
he had taken it up , and was stooping to work again , when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress .
he raised them , and saw her face .
the two spectators started forward , but she stayed them with a motion of her hand .
she had no fear of his striking at her with the knife , though they had .
he stared at her with a fearful look , and after a while his lips began to form some words , though no sound proceeded from them .
by degrees , in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing , he was heard to say : what is this ?
with the tears streaming down her face , she put her two hands to her lips , and kissed them to him ; then clasped them on her breast , as if she laid his ruined head there .
you are not the gaoler's daughter ?
she sighed no .
who are you ?
not yet trusting the tones of her voice , she sat down on the bench beside him .
he recoiled , but she laid her hand upon his arm .
a strange thrill struck him when she did so , and visibly passed over his frame ; he laid the knife down softly , as he sat staring at her .
her golden hair , which she wore in long curls , had been hurriedly pushed aside , and fell down over her neck .
advancing his hand by little and little , he took it up and looked at it .
in the midst of the action he went astray , and , with another deep sigh , fell to work at his shoemaking .
but not for long .
releasing his arm , she laid her hand upon his shoulder .
after looking doubtfully at it , two or three times , as if to be sure that it was really there , he laid down his work , put his hand to his neck , and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it .
he opened this , carefully , on his knee , and it contained a very little quantity of hair : not more than one or two long golden hairs , which he had , in some old day , wound off upon his finger .
he took her hair into his hand again , and looked closely at it .
it is the same .
how can it be !
when was it !
how was it !
as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead , he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too .
he turned her full to the light , and looked at her .
she had laid her head upon my shoulder , that night when i was summoned outshe had a fear of my going , though i had noneand when i was brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve .
'you will leave me them ?
they can never help me to escape in the body , though they may in the spirit .
'those were the words i said .
i remember them very well .
he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it .
but when he did find spoken words for it , they came to him coherently , though slowly .
how was this ?
wasit you ?
once more , the two spectators started , as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness .
but she sat perfectly still in his grasp , and only said , in a low voice , i entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move !
hark !
he exclaimed .
whose voice was that ?
his hands released her as he uttered this cry , and went up to his white hair , which they tore in a frenzy .
it died out , as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him , and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast ; but he still looked at her , and gloomily shook his head .
no , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming .
it can't be .
see what the prisoner is .
these are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard .
no , no .
she wasand he wasbefore the slow years of the north towerages ago .
what is your name , my gentle angel ?
hailing his softened tone and manner , his daughter fell upon her knees before him , with her appealing hands upon his breast .
o , sir , at another time you shall know my name , and who my mother was , and who my father , and how i never knew their hard , hard history .
but i cannot tell you at this time , and i cannot tell you here .
all that i may tell you , here and now , is , that i pray to you to touch me and to bless me .
kiss me , kiss me !
o my dear , my dear !
his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair , which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him .
if you hear in my voicei don't know that it is so , but i hope it isif you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it !
if you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it !
if , when i hint to you of a home that is before us , where i will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , i bring back the remembrance of a home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it !
she held him closer round the neck , and rocked him on her breast like a child .
if , when i tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that i have come here to take you from it , and that we go to england to be at peace and at rest , i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native france so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it !
and if , when i shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that i have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it !
weep for her , then , and for me !
good gentlemen , thank god !
i feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart .
o , see !
thank god for us , thank god !
he had sunk in her arms , and his face dropped on her breast : a sight so touching , yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it , that the two beholders covered their faces .
when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed , and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all stormsemblem to humanity , of the rest and silence into which the storm called life must hush at lastthey came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground .
he had gradually dropped to the floor , and lay there in a lethargy , worn out .
she had nestled down with him , that his head might lie upon her arm ; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light .
if , without disturbing him , she said , raising her hand to mr. lorry as he stooped over them , after repeated blowings of his nose , all could be arranged for our leaving paris at once , so that , from the very door , he could be taken away but , consider .
is he fit for the journey ?
asked mr. lorry .
more fit for that , i think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him .
it is true , said defarge , who was kneeling to look on and hear .
more than that ; monsieur manette is , for all reasons , best out of france .
say , shall i hire a carriage and posthorses ?
that's business , said mr. lorry , resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners ; and if business is to be done , i had better do it .
then be so kind , urged miss manette , as to leave us here .
you see how composed he has become , and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now .
why should you be ?
if you will lock the door to secure us from interruption , i do not doubt that you will find him , when you come back , as quiet as you leave him .
in any case , i will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight .
both mr. lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course , and in favour of one of them remaining .
but , as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to , but travelling papers ; and as time pressed , for the day was drawing to an end , it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done , and hurrying away to do it .
then , as the darkness closed in , the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side , and watched him .
the darkness deepened and deepened , and they both lay quiet , until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall .
mr. lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey , and had brought with them , besides travelling cloaks and wrappers , bread and meat , wine , and hot coffee .
monsieur defarge put this provender , and the lamp he carried , on the shoemaker's bench there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed , and he and mr. lorry roused the captive , and assisted him to his feet .
no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind , in the scared blank wonder of his face .
whether he knew what had happened , whether he recollected what they had said to him , whether he knew that he was free , were questions which no sagacity could have solved .
they tried speaking to him ; but , he was so confused , and so very slow to answer , that they took fright at his bewilderment , and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more .
he had a wild , lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands , that had not been seen in him before ; yet , he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice , and invariably turned to it when she spoke .
in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion , he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink , and put on the cloak and other wrappings , that they gave him to wear .
he readily responded to his daughter's drawing her arm through his , and tookand kepther hand in both his own .
they began to descend ; monsieur defarge going first with the lamp , mr. lorry closing the little procession .
they had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped , and stared at the roof and round at the walls .
you remember the place , my father ?
you remember coming up here ?
what did you say ?
but , before she could repeat the question , he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it .
remember ?
no , i don't remember .
it was so very long ago .
that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house , was apparent to them .
they heard him mutter , one hundred and five , north tower ; and when he looked about him , it evidently was for the strong fortresswalls which had long encompassed him .
on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread , as being in expectation of a drawbridge ; and when there was no drawbridge , and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street , he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again .
no crowd was about the door ; no people were discernible at any of the many windows ; not even a chance passerby was in the street .
an unnatural silence and desertion reigned there .
only one soul was to be seen , and that was madame defargewho leaned against the doorpost , knitting , and saw nothing .
the prisoner had got into a coach , and his daughter had followed him , when mr. lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking , miserably , for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes .
madame defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them , and went , knitting , out of the lamplight , through the courtyard .
she quickly brought them down and handed them in ;and immediately afterwards leaned against the doorpost , knitting , and saw nothing .
defarge got upon the box , and gave the word to the barrier !
the postilion cracked his whip , and they clattered away under the feeble overswinging lamps .
under the overswinging lampsswinging ever brighter in the better streets , and ever dimmer in the worseand by lighted shops , gay crowds , illuminated coffeehouses , and theatredoors , to one of the city gates .
soldiers with lanterns , at the guardhouse there .
your papers , travellers !
see here then , monsieur the officer , said defarge , getting down , and taking him gravely apart , these are the papers of monsieur inside , with the white head .
they were consigned to me , with him , at the he dropped his voice , there was a flutter among the military lanterns , and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform , the eyes connected with the arm looked , not an every day or an every night look , at monsieur with the white head .
it is well .
forward !
from the uniform .
adieu !
from defarge .
and so , under a short grove of feebler and feebler overswinging lamps , out under the great grove of stars .
beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights ; some , so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it , as a point in space where anything is suffered or done : the shadows of the night were broad and black .
all through the cold and restless interval , until dawn , they once more whispered in the ears of mr. jarvis lorrysitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out , and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him , and what were capable of restorationthe old inquiry : i hope you care to be recalled to life ?
and the old answer : i can't say .
tellson's bank by temple bar was an oldfashioned place , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty .
it was very small , very dark , very ugly , very incommodious .
it was an oldfashioned place , moreover , in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were proud of its smallness , proud of its darkness , proud of its ugliness , proud of its incommodiousness .
they were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars , and were fired by an express conviction that , if it were less objectionable , it would be less respectable .
this was no passive belief , but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business .
tellson's they said wanted no elbowroom , tellson's wanted no light , tellson's wanted no embellishment .
noakes and co .
'smight , or snooks brothers' might ; but tellson's , thank heaven !
any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding tellson's .
in this respect the house was much on a par with the country ; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable , but were only the more respectable .
thus it had come to pass , that tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience .
after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat , you fell into tellson's down two steps , and came to your senses in a miserable little shop , with two little counters , where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it , while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows , which were always under a showerbath of mud from fleetstreet , and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper , and the heavy shadow of temple bar .
if your business necessitated your seeing the house , you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back , where you meditated on a misspent life , until the house came with its hands in its pockets , and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight .
your money came out of , or went into , wormy old wooden drawers , particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut .
your banknotes had a musty odour , as if they were fast decomposing into rags again .
your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools , and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two .
your deeds got into extemporised strongrooms made of kitchens and sculleries , and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the bankinghouse air .
your lighter boxes of family papers went upstairs into a barmecide room , that always had a great diningtable in it and never had a dinner , and where , even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty , the first letters written to you by your old love , or by your little children , were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows , by the heads exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of abyssinia or ashantee .
but indeed , at that time , putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions , and not least of all with tellson's .
death is nature's remedy for all things , and why not legislation's ?
accordingly , the forger was put to death ; the utterer of a bad note was put to death ; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death ; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death ; the holder of a horse at tellson's door , who made off with it , was put to death ; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death ; the sounders of threefourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime , were put to death .
not that it did the least good in the way of preventionit might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reversebut , it cleared off as to this world the trouble of each particular case , and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after .
thus , tellson's , in its day , like greater places of business , its contemporaries , had taken so many lives , that , if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately disposed of , they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had , in a rather significant manner .
cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellson's , the oldest of men carried on the business gravely .
when they took a young man into tellson's london house , they hid him somewhere till he was old .
they kept him in a dark place , like a cheese , until he had the full tellson flavour and bluemould upon him .
then only was he permitted to be seen , spectacularly poring over large books , and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment .
outside tellson'snever by any means in it , unless called inwas an oddjobman , an occasional porter and messenger , who served as the live sign of the house .
he was never absent during business hours , unless upon an errand , and then he was represented by his son : a grisly urchin of twelve , who was his express image .
people understood that tellson's , in a stately way , tolerated the oddjobman .
the house had always tolerated some person in that capacity , and time and tide had drifted this person to the post .
his surname was cruncher , and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness , in the easterly parish church of hounsditch , he had received the added appellation of jerry .
the scene was mr. cruncher's private lodging in hangingswordalley , whitefriars : the time , halfpast seven of the clock on a windy march morning , anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty .
mr .
cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes : apparently under the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a popular game , by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it .
mr. cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood , and were but two in number , even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one .
but they were very decently kept .
early as it was , on the windy march morning , the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout ; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast , and the lumbering deal table , a very clean white cloth was spread .
mr. cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane , like a harlequin at home .
at first , he slept heavily , but , by degrees , began to roll and surge in bed , until he rose above the surface , with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons .
at which juncture , he exclaimed , in a voice of dire exasperation : bust me , if she ain't at it agin !
a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner , with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to .
what !
said mr. cruncher , looking out of bed for a boot .
you're at it agin , are you ?
after hailing the morn with this second salutation , he threw a boot at the woman as a third .
it was a very muddy boot , and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with mr. cruncher's domestic economy , that , whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots , he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay .
what , said mr. cruncher , varying his apostrophe after missing his markwhat are you up to , aggerawayter ?
i was only saying my prayers .
saying your prayers !
you're a nice woman !
what do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me ?
i was not praying against you ; i was praying for you .
you weren't .
and if you were , i won't be took the liberty with .
here !
your mother's a nice woman , young jerry , going a praying agin your father's prosperity .
you've got a dutiful mother , you have , my son .
you've got a religious mother , you have , my boy : going and flopping herself down , and praying that the breadandbutter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child .
master cruncher who was in his shirt took this very ill , and , turning to his mother , strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board .
and what do you suppose , you conceited female , said mr. cruncher , with unconscious inconsistency , that the worth of your prayers may be ?
name the price that you put your prayers at !
they only come from the heart , jerry .
they are worth no more than that .
worth no more than that , repeated mr. cruncher .
they ain't worth much , then .
whether or no , i won't be prayed agin , i tell you .
i can't afford it .
i'm not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking .
if you must go flopping yourself down , flop in favour of your husband and child , and not in opposition to 'em .
if i had had any but a unnat'ral wife , and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother , i might have made some money last week instead of being counterprayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck .
buuust me !
said mr. cruncher , who all this time had been putting on his clothes , if i ain't , what with piety and one blowed thing and another , been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with !
young jerry , dress yourself , my boy , and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then , and if you see any signs of more flopping , give me a call .
for , i tell you , here he addressed his wife once more , i won't be gone agin , in this manner .
i am as rickety as a hackneycoach , i'm as sleepy as laudanum , my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldn't know , if it wasn't for the pain in 'em , which was me and which somebody else , yet i'm none the better for it in pocket ; and it's my suspicion that you've been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket , and i won't put up with it , aggerawayter , and what do you say now !
growling , in addition , such phrases as ah !
yes !
you're religious , too .
you wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you ?
not you !
and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation , mr. cruncher betook himself to his bootcleaning and his general preparation for business .
in the meantime , his son , whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes , and whose young eyes stood close by one another , as his father's did , kept the required watch upon his mother .
he greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals , by darting out of his sleeping closet , where he made his toilet , with a suppressed cry of you are going to flop , mother .
halloa , father !
and , after raising this fictitious alarm , darting in again with an undutiful grin .
mr. cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast .
he resented mrs. cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity .
now , aggerawayter !
what are you up to ?
at it again ?
his wife explained that she had merely asked a blessing .
don't do it !
said mr. crunches looking about , as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions .
i ain't a going to be blest out of house and home .
i won't have my wittles blest off my table .
keep still !
exceedingly redeyed and grim , as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn , jerry cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it , growling over it like any fourfooted inmate of a menagerie .
towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect , and , presenting as respectable and businesslike an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with , issued forth to the occupation of the day .
it could scarcely be called a trade , in spite of his favourite description of himself as a honest tradesman .
his stock consisted of a wooden stool , made out of a brokenbacked chair cut down , which stool , young jerry , walking at his father's side , carried every morning to beneath the bankinghouse window that was nearest temple bar : where , with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the oddjobman's feet , it formed the encampment for the day .
on this post of his , mr. cruncher was as well known to fleetstreet and the temple , as the bar itself ,and was almost as inlooking .
encamped at a quarter before nine , in good time to touch his threecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellson's , jerry took up his station on this windy march morning , with young jerry standing by him , when not engaged in making forays through the bar , to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose .
father and son , extremely like each other , looking silently on at the morning traffic in fleetstreet , with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were , bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys .
the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance , that the mature jerry bit and spat out straw , while the twinkling eyes of the youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in fleetstreet .
the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellson's establishment was put through the door , and the word was given : porter wanted !
hooray , father !
here's an early job to begin with !
having thus given his parent god speed , young jerry seated himself on the stool , entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing , and cogitated .
always rusty !
his fingers is always rusty !
muttered young jerry .
where does my father get all that iron rust from ?
he don't get no iron rust here !
you know the old bailey well , no doubt ?
said one of the oldest of clerks to jerry the messenger .
yees , sir , returned jerry , in something of a dogged manner .
i do know the bailey .
just so .
and you know mr. lorry .
i know mr. lorry , sir , much better than i know the bailey .
much better , said jerry , not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question , than i , as a honest tradesman , wish to know the bailey .
very well .
find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the doorkeeper this note for mr. lorry .
he will then let you in .
into the court , sir ?
into the court .
mr. cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another , and to interchange the inquiry , what do you think of this ?
am i to wait in the court , sir ?
he asked , as the result of that conference .
i am going to tell you .
the doorkeeper will pass the note to mr. lorry , and do you make any gesture that will attract mr. lorry's attention , and show him where you stand .
then what you have to do , is , to remain there until he wants you .
is that all , sir ?
that's all .
he wishes to have a messenger at hand .
this is to tell him you are there .
as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note , mr. cruncher , after surveying him in silence until he came to the blottingpaper stage , remarked : i suppose they'll be trying forgeries this morning ?
treason !
that's quartering , said jerry .
barbarous !
it is the law , remarked the ancient clerk , turning his surprised spectacles upon him .
it is the law .
it's hard in the law to spile a man , i think .
it's hard enough to kill him , but it's wery hard to spile him , sir .
not at all , retained the ancient clerk .
speak well of the law .
take care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself .
i give you that advice .
it's the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , said jerry .
i leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is .
well , well , said the old clerk ; we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood .
some of us have damp ways , and some of us have dry ways .
here is the letter .
go along .
jerry took the letter , and , remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of , you are a lean old one , too , made his bow , informed his son , in passing , of his destination , and went his way .
they hanged at tyburn , in those days , so the street outside newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it .
but , the gaol was a vile place , in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised , and where dire diseases were bred , that came into court with the prisoners , and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my lord chief justice himself , and pulled him off the bench .
it had more than once happened , that the judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's , and even died before him .
for the rest , the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly innyard , from which pale travellers set out continually , in carts and coaches , on a violent passage into the other world : traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road , and shaming few good citizens , if any .
so powerful is use , and so desirable to be good use in the beginning .
it was famous , too , for the pillory , a wise old institution , that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent ; also , for the whippingpost , another dear old institution , very humanising and softening to behold in action ; also , for extensive transactions in bloodmoney , another fragment of ancestral wisdom , systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under heaven .
altogether , the old bailey , at that date , was a choice illustration of the precept , that whatever is is right ; an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy , did it not include the troublesome consequence , that nothing that ever was , was wrong .
making his way through the tainted crowd , dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action , with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly , the messenger found out the door he sought , and handed in his letter through a trap in it .
for , people then paid to see the play at the old bailey , just as they paid to see the play in bedlamonly the former entertainment was much the dearer .
therefore , all the old bailey doors were well guardedexcept , indeed , the social doors by which the criminals got there , and those were always left wide open .
after some delay and demur , the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way , and allowed mr. jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into court .
what's on ?
he asked , in a whisper , of the man he found himself next to .
nothing yet .
what's coming on ?
the treason case .
the quartering one , eh ?
ah !
returned the man , with a relish ; he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged , and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own face , and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on , and then his head will be chopped off , and he'll be cut into quarters .
that's the sentence .
if he's found guilty , you mean to say ?
jerry added , by way of proviso .
oh !
they'll find him guilty , said the other .
don't you be afraid of that .
mr. cruncher's attention was here diverted to the doorkeeper , whom he saw making his way to mr. lorry , with the note in his hand .
mr. lorry sat at a table , among the gentlemen in wigs : not far from a wigged gentleman , the prisoner's counsel , who had a great bundle of papers before him : and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets , whose whole attention , when mr. cruncher looked at him then or afterwards , seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court .
after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand , jerry attracted the notice of mr. lorry , who had stood up to look for him , and who quietly nodded and sat down again .
what's he got to do with the case ?
asked the man he had spoken with .
blest if i know , said jerry .
what have you got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire ?
blest if i know that either , said jerry .
the entrance of the judge , and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court , stopped the dialogue .
presently , the dock became the central point of interest .
two gaolers , who had been standing there , went out , and the prisoner was brought in , and put to the bar .
everybody present , except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling , stared at him .
all the human breath in the place , rolled at him , like a sea , or a wind , or a fire .
eager faces strained round pillars and corners , to get a sight of him ; spectators in back rows stood up , not to miss a hair of him ; people on the floor of the court , laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them , to help themselves , at anybody's cost , to a view of himstood atiptoe , got upon ledges , stood upon next to nothing , to see every inch of him .
conspicuous among these latter , like an animated bit of the spiked wall of newgate , jerry stood : aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along , and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer , and gin , and tea , and coffee , and what not , that flowed at him , and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain .
the object of all this staring and blaring , was a young man of about fiveandtwenty , wellgrown and welllooking , with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye .
his condition was that of a young gentleman .
he was plainly dressed in black , or very dark grey , and his hair , which was long and dark , was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck ; more to be out of his way than for ornament .
as an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body , so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek , showing the soul to be stronger than the sun .
he was otherwise quite selfpossessed , bowed to the judge , and stood quiet .
the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at , was not a sort that elevated humanity .
had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentencehad there been a chance of any one of its savage details being sparedby just so much would he have lost in his fascination .
the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled , was the sight ; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder , yielded the sensation .
whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest , according to their several arts and powers of selfdeceit , the interest was , at the root of it , ogreish .
silence in the court !
charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to an indictment denouncing him with infinite jingle and jangle for that he was a false traitor to our serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , prince , our lord the king , by reason of his having , on divers occasions , and by divers means and ways , assisted lewis , the french king , in his wars against our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth ; that was to say , by coming and going , between the dominions of our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , and those of the said french lewis , and wickedly , falsely , traitorously , and otherwise eviladverbiously , revealing to the said french lewis what forces our said serene , illustrious , excellent , and so forth , had in preparation to send to canada and north america .
this much , jerry , with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it , made out with huge satisfaction , and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid , and over and over again aforesaid , charles darnay , stood there before him upon his trial ; that the jury were swearing in ; and that mr. attorneygeneral was making ready to speak .
the accused , who was and who knew he was being mentally hanged , beheaded , and quartered , by everybody there , neither flinched from the situation , nor assumed any theatrical air in it .
he was quiet and attentive ; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest ; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him , so composedly , that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn .
the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar , as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever .
over the prisoner's head there was a mirror , to throw the light down upon him .
crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it , and had passed from its surface and this earth's together .
haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been , if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections , as the ocean is one day to give up its dead .
some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved , may have struck the prisoner's mind .
be that as it may , a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face , he looked up ; and when he saw the glass his face flushed , and his right hand pushed the herbs away .
it happened , that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left .
about on a level with his eyes , there sat , in that corner of the judge's bench , two persons upon whom his look immediately rested ; so immediately , and so much to the changing of his aspect , that all the eyes that were turned upon him , turned to them .
the spectators saw in the two figures , a young lady of little more than twenty , and a gentleman who was evidently her father ; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair , and a certain indescribable intensity of face : not of an active kind , but pondering and selfcommuning .
when this expression was upon him , he looked as if he were old ; but when it was stirred and broken upas it was now , in a moment , on his speaking to his daughterhe became a handsome man , not past the prime of life .
his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm , as she sat by him , and the other pressed upon it .
she had drawn close to him , in her dread of the scene , and in her pity for the prisoner .
her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused .
this had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her ; and the whisper went about , who are they ?
jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were .
the crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back ; at last it got to jerry : witnesses .
for which side ?
against .
against what side ?
the prisoner's .
the judge , whose eyes had gone in the general direction , recalled them , leaned back in his seat , and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand , as mr. attorneygeneral rose to spin the rope , grind the axe , and hammer the nails into the scaffold .
mr. attorneygeneral had to inform the jury , that the prisoner before them , though young in years , was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life .
that this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of today , or of yesterday , or even of last year , or of the year before .
that , it was certain the prisoner had , for longer than that , been in the habit of passing and repassing between france and england , on secret business of which he could give no honest account .
that , if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive which happily it never was , the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered .
that providence , however , had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach , to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes , and , struck with horror , to disclose them to his majesty's chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council .
that , this patriot would be produced before them .
that , his position and attitude were , on the whole , sublime .
that , he had been the prisoner's friend , but , at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy , had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom , on the sacred altar of his country .
that , if statues were decreed in britain , as in ancient greece and rome , to public benefactors , this shining citizen would assuredly have had one .
that , as they were not so decreed , he probably would not have one .
that , virtue , as had been observed by the poets in many passages which he well knew the jury would have , word for word , at the tips of their tongues ; whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages , was in a manner contagious ; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism , or love of country .
that , the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the crown , to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour , had communicated itself to the prisoner's servant , and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master's tabledrawers and pockets , and secrete his papers .
that , he mr .
attorneygeneral was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant ; but that , in a general way , he preferred him to his mr .
attorneygeneral's brothers and sisters , and honoured him more than his mr .
attorneygeneral's father and mother .
that , he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise .
that , the evidence of these two witnesses , coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced , would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his majesty's forces , and of their disposition and preparation , both by sea and land , and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power .
that , these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting ; but that it was all the same ; that , indeed , it was rather the better for the prosecution , as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions .
that , the proof would go back five years , and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions , within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the british troops and the americans .
that , for these reasons , the jury , being a loyal jury as he knew they were , and being a responsible jury as they knew they were , must positively find the prisoner guilty , and make an end of him , whether they liked it or not .
that , they never could lay their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows ; that , they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows ; in short , that there never more could be , for them or theirs , any laying of heads upon pillows at all , unless the prisoner's head was taken off .
that head mr. attorneygeneral concluded by demanding of them , in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it , and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone .
when the attorneygeneral ceased , a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blueflies were swarming about the prisoner , in anticipation of what he was soon to become .
when toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witnessbox .
mr. solicitorgeneral then , following his leader's lead , examined the patriot : john barsad , gentleman , by name .
the story of his pure soul was exactly what mr. attorneygeneral had described it to beperhaps , if it had a fault , a little too exactly .
having released his noble bosom of its burden , he would have modestly withdrawn himself , but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him , sitting not far from mr. lorry , begged to ask him a few questions .
the wigged gentleman sitting opposite , still looking at the ceiling of the court .
had he ever been a spy himself ?
no , he scorned the base insinuation .
what did he live upon ?
his property .
where was his property ?
he didn't precisely remember where it was .
what was it ?
no business of anybody's .
had he inherited it ?
yes , he had .
from whom ?
distant relation .
very distant ?
rather .
ever been in prison ?
certainly not .
never in a debtors' prison ?
didn't see what that had to do with it .
never in a debtors' prison ?
come ,once again .
never ?
yes .
how many times ?
two or three times .
not five or six ?
perhaps .
of what profession ?
gentleman .
ever been kicked ?
might have been .
frequently ?
no .
ever kicked downstairs ?
decidedly not ; once received a kick on the top of a staircase , and fell downstairs of his own accord .
kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice ?
something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault , but it was not true .
swear it was not true ?
positively .
ever live by cheating at play ?
never .
ever live by play ?
not more than other gentlemen do .
ever borrow money of the prisoner ?
yes .
ever pay him ?
no .
was not this intimacy with the prisoner , in reality a very slight one , forced upon the prisoner in coaches , inns , and packets ?
no .
sure he saw the prisoner with these lists ?
certain .
knew no more about the lists ?
no .
had not procured them himself , for instance ?
no .
expect to get anything by this evidence ?
no .
not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps ?
oh dear no .
or to do anything ?
oh dear no .
swear that ?
over and over again .
no motives but motives of sheer patriotism ?
none whatever .
the virtuous servant , roger cly , swore his way through the case at a great rate .
he had taken service with the prisoner , in good faith and simplicity , four years ago .
he had asked the prisoner , aboard the calais packet , if he wanted a handy fellow , and the prisoner had engaged him .
he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charitynever thought of such a thing .
he began to have suspicions of the prisoner , and to keep an eye upon him , soon afterwards .
in arranging his clothes , while travelling , he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets , over and over again .
he had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk .
he had not put them there first .
he had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen at calais , and similar lists to french gentlemen , both at calais and boulogne .
he loved his country , and couldn't bear it , and had given information .
he had never been suspected of stealing a silver teapot ; he had been maligned respecting a mustardpot , but it turned out to be only a plated one .
he had known the last witness seven or eight years ; that was merely a coincidence .
he didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence ; most coincidences were curious .
neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too .
he was a true briton , and hoped there were many like him .
the blueflies buzzed again , and mr. attorneygeneral called mr. jarvis lorry .
mr .
jarvis lorry , are you a clerk in tellson's bank ?
i am .
on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive , did business occasion you to travel between london and dover by the mail ?
it did .
were there any other passengers in the mail ?
two .
did they alight on the road in the course of the night ?
they did .
mr .
lorry , look upon the prisoner .
was he one of those two passengers ?
i cannot undertake to say that he was .
does he resemble either of these two passengers ?
both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that i cannot undertake to say even that .
mr .
lorry , look again upon the prisoner .
supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them ?
no .
you will not swear , mr. lorry , that he was not one of them ?
no .
so at least you say he may have been one of them ?
yes .
except that i remember them both to have beenlike myselftimorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air .
did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , mr. lorry ?
i certainly have seen that .
mr .
lorry , look once more upon the prisoner .
have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before ?
i have .
when ?
i was returning from france a few days afterwards , and , at calais , the prisoner came on board the packetship in which i returned , and made the voyage with me .
at what hour did he come on board ?
at a little after midnight .
in the dead of the night .
was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour ?
he happened to be the only one .
never mind about 'happening ,' mr. lorry .
he was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night ?
he was .
were you travelling alone , mr. lorry , or with any companion ?
with two companions .
a gentleman and lady .
they are here .
they are here .
had you any conversation with the prisoner ?
hardly any .
the weather was stormy , and the passage long and rough , and i lay on a sofa , almost from shore to shore .
miss manette !
the young lady , to whom all eyes had been turned before , and were now turned again , stood up where she had sat .
her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm .
miss manette , look upon the prisoner .
to be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd .
standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still .
his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden ; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart .
the buzz of the great flies was loud again .
miss manette , have you seen the prisoner before ?
yes , sir .
where ?
on board of the packetship just now referred to , sir , and on the same occasion .
you are the young lady just now referred to ?
o !
most unhappily , i am !
the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the judge , as he said something fiercely : answer the questions put to you , and make no remark upon them .
miss manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the channel ?
yes , sir .
recall it .
in the midst of a profound stillness , she faintly began : when the gentleman came on board do you mean the prisoner ?
inquired the judge , knitting his brows .
yes , my lord .
then say the prisoner .
when the prisoner came on board , he noticed that my father , turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her , was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health .
my father was so reduced that i was afraid to take him out of the air , and i had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps , and i sat on the deck at his side to take care of him .
there were no other passengers that night , but we four .
the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could shelter my father from the wind and weather , better than i had done .
i had not known how to do it well , not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour .
he did it for me .
he expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father's state , and i am sure he felt it .
that was the manner of our beginning to speak together .
let me interrupt you for a moment .
had he come on board alone ?
no .
how many were with him ?
two french gentlemen .
had they conferred together ?
they had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat .
had any papers been handed about among them , similar to these lists ?
some papers had been handed about among them , but i don't know what papers .
like these in shape and size ?
possibly , but indeed i don't know , although they stood whispering very near to me : because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there ; it was a dull lamp , and they spoke very low , and i did not hear what they said , and saw only that they looked at papers .
now , to the prisoner's conversation , miss manette .
the prisoner was as open in his confidence with mewhich arose out of my helpless situationas he was kind , and good , and useful to my father .
i hope , bursting into tears , i may not repay him by doing him harm today .
buzzing from the blueflies .
miss manette , if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to givewhich you must giveand which you cannot escape from givingwith great unwillingness , he is the only person present in that condition .
please to go on .
he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature , which might get people into trouble , and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name .
he said that this business had , within a few days , taken him to france , and might , at intervals , take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long time to come .
did he say anything about america , miss manette ?
be particular .
he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen , and he said that , so far as he could judge , it was a wrong and foolish one on england's part .
he added , in a jesting way , that perhaps george washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the third .
but there was no harm in his way of saying this : it was said laughingly , and to beguile the time .
any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators .
her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence , and , in the pauses when she stopped for the judge to write it down , watched its effect upon the counsel for and against .
among the lookerson there was the same expression in all quarters of the court ; insomuch , that a great majority of the foreheads there , might have been mirrors reflecting the witness , when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about george washington .
mr. attorneygeneral now signified to my lord , that he deemed it necessary , as a matter of precaution and form , to call the young lady's father , doctor manette .
who was called accordingly .
doctor manette , look upon the prisoner .
have you ever seen him before ?
once .
when he called at my lodgings in london .
some three years , or three years and a half ago .
can you identify him as your fellowpassenger on board the packet , or speak to his conversation with your daughter ?
sir , i can do neither .
is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either ?
he answered , in a low voice , there is .
has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment , without trial , or even accusation , in your native country , doctor manette ?
he answered , in a tone that went to every heart , a long imprisonment .
were you newly released on the occasion in question ?
they tell me so .
have you no remembrance of the occasion ?
none .
my mind is a blank , from some timei cannot even say what timewhen i employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter here .
she had become familiar to me , when a gracious god restored my faculties ; but , i am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar .
i have no remembrance of the process .
mr. attorneygeneral sat down , and the father and daughter sat down together .
a singular circumstance then arose in the case .
the object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down , with some fellowplotter untracked , in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago , and got out of the mail in the night , as a blind , at a place where he did not remain , but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more , to a garrison and dockyard , and there collected information ; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required , in the coffeeroom of an hotel in that garrisonanddockyard town , waiting for another person .
the prisoner's counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result , except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion , when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court , wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper , screwed it up , and tossed it to him .
opening this piece of paper in the next pause , the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner .
you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner ?
the witness was quite sure .
did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner ?
not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken .
look well upon that gentleman , my learned friend there , pointing to him who had tossed the paper over , and then look well upon the prisoner .
how say you ?
are they very like each other ?
allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched , they were sufficiently like each other to surprise , not only the witness , but everybody present , when they were thus brought into comparison .
my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig , and giving no very gracious consent , the likeness became much more remarkable .
my lord inquired of mr. stryver the prisoner's counsel , whether they were next to try mr. carton name of my learned friend for treason ?
but , mr. stryver replied to my lord , no ; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once , might happen twice ; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner , whether he would be so confident , having seen it ; and more .
the upshot of which , was , to smash this witness like a crockery vessel , and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber .
mr. cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence .
he had now to attend while mr. stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury , like a compact suit of clothes ; showing them how the patriot , barsad , was a hired spy and traitor , an unblushing trafficker in blood , and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed judaswhich he certainly did look rather like .
how the virtuous servant , cly , was his friend and partner , and was worthy to be ; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim , because some family affairs in france , he being of french extraction , did require his making those passages across the channelthough what those affairs were , a consideration for others who were near and dear to him , forbade him , even for his life , to disclose .
how the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady , whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed , came to nothing , involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together ;with the exception of that reference to george washington , which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke .
how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears , and therefore mr. attorneygeneral had made the most of it ; how , nevertheless , it rested upon nothing , save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases , and of which the state trials of this country were full .
but , there my lord interposed with as grave a face as if it had not been true , saying that he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions .
mr. stryver then called his few witnesses , and mr. cruncher had next to attend while mr. attorneygeneral turned the whole suit of clothes mr. stryver had fitted on the jury , inside out ; showing how barsad and cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them , and the prisoner a hundred times worse .
lastly , came my lord himself , turning the suit of clothes , now inside out , now outside in , but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into graveclothes for the prisoner .
and now , the jury turned to consider , and the great flies swarmed again .
mr. carton , who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court , changed neither his place nor his attitude , even in this excitement .
while his learned friend , mr. stryver , massing his papers before him , whispered with those who sat near , and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury ; while all the spectators moved more or less , and grouped themselves anew ; while even my lord himself arose from his seat , and slowly paced up and down his platform , not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish ; this one man sat leaning back , with his torn gown half off him , his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal , his hands in his pockets , and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day .
something especially reckless in his demeanour , not only gave him a disreputable look , but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his momentary earnestness , when they were compared together , had strengthened , that many of the lookerson , taking note of him now , said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike .
mr. cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour , and added , i'd hold half a guinea that he don't get no lawwork to do .
don't look like the sort of one to get any , do he ?
yet , this mr. carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in ; for now , when miss manette's head dropped upon her father's breast , he was the first to see it , and to say audibly : officer !
look to that young lady .
help the gentleman to take her out .
don't you see she will fall !
there was much commiseration for her as she was removed , and much sympathy with her father .
it had evidently been a great distress to him , to have the days of his imprisonment recalled .
he had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned , and that pondering or brooding look which made him old , had been upon him , like a heavy cloud , ever since .
as he passed out , the jury , who had turned back and paused a moment , spoke , through their foreman .
they were not agreed , and wished to retire .
my lord perhaps with george washington on his mind showed some surprise that they were not agreed , but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward , and retired himself .
the trial had lasted all day , and the lamps in the court were now being lighted .
it began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while .
the spectators dropped off to get refreshment , and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock , and sat down .
mr. lorry , who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out , now reappeared , and beckoned to jerry : who , in the slackened interest , could easily get near him .
jerry , if you wish to take something to eat , you can .
but , keep in the way .
you will be sure to hear when the jury come in .
don't be a moment behind them , for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank .
you are the quickest messenger i know , and will get to temple bar long before i can .
jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle , and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling .
mr. carton came up at the moment , and touched mr. lorry on the arm .
how is the young lady ?
she is greatly distressed ; but her father is comforting her , and she feels the better for being out of court .
i'll tell the prisoner so .
it won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you , to be seen speaking to him publicly , you know .
mr. lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind , and mr. carton made his way to the outside of the bar .
the way out of court lay in that direction , and jerry followed him , all eyes , ears , and spikes .
mr .
darnay !
the prisoner came forward directly .
you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , miss manette .
she will do very well .
you have seen the worst of her agitation .
i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it .
could you tell her so for me , with my fervent acknowledgments ?
yes , i could .
i will , if you ask it .
mr. carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent .
he stood , half turned from the prisoner , lounging with his elbow against the bar .
i do ask it .
accept my cordial thanks .
what , said carton , still only half turned towards him , do you expect , mr. darnay ?
the worst .
it's the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest .
but i think their withdrawing is in your favour .
loitering on the way out of court not being allowed , jerry heard no more : but left themso like each other in feature , so unlike each other in mannerstanding side by side , both reflected in the glass above them .
an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thiefandrascal crowded passages below , even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale .
the hoarse messenger , uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection , had dropped into a doze , when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court , carried him along with them .
jerry !
jerry !
mr. lorry was already calling at the door when he got there .
here , sir !
it's a fight to get back again .
here i am , sir !
mr. lorry handed him a paper through the throng .
quick !
have you got it ?
yes , sir .
hastily written on the paper was the word acquitted .
if you had sent the message , 'recalled to life ,' again , muttered jerry , as he turned , i should have known what you meant , this time .
he had no opportunity of saying , or so much as thinking , anything else , until he was clear of the old bailey ; for , the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs , and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blueflies were dispersing in search of other carrion .
from the dimlylighted passages of the court , the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day , was straining off , when doctor manette , lucie manette , his daughter , mr. lorry , the solicitor for the defence , and its counsel , mr. stryver , stood gathered round mr. charles darnayjust releasedcongratulating him on his escape from death .
it would have been difficult by a far brighter light , to recognise in doctor manette , intellectual of face and upright of bearing , the shoemaker of the garret in paris .
yet , no one could have looked at him twice , without looking again : even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice , and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully , without any apparent reason .
while one external cause , and that a reference to his long lingering agony , would alwaysas on the trialevoke this condition from the depths of his soul , it was also in its nature to arise of itself , and to draw a gloom over him , as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun , when the substance was three hundred miles away .
only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind .
she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his misery , and to a present beyond his misery : and the sound of her voice , the light of her face , the touch of her hand , had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always .
not absolutely always , for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed ; but they were few and slight , and she believed them over .
mr. darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully , and had turned to mr. stryver , whom he warmly thanked .
mr. stryver , a man of little more than thirty , but looking twenty years older than he was , stout , loud , red , bluff , and free from any drawback of delicacy , had a pushing way of shouldering himself morally and physically into companies and conversations , that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life .
he still had his wig and gown on , and he said , squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr. lorry clean out of the group : i am glad to have brought you off with honour , mr. darnay .
it was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous ; but not the less likely to succeed on that account .
you have laid me under an obligation to you for lifein two senses , said his late client , taking his hand .
i have done my best for you , mr. darnay ; and my best is as good as another man's , i believe .
it clearly being incumbent on some one to say , much better , mr. lorry said it ; perhaps not quite disinterestedly , but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again .
you think so ?
said mr. stryver .
well !
you have been present all day , and you ought to know .
you are a man of business , too .
and as such , quoth mr. lorry , whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group , just as he had previously shouldered him out of itas such i will appeal to doctor manette , to break up this conference and order us all to our homes .
miss lucie looks ill , mr. darnay has had a terrible day , we are worn out .
speak for yourself , mr. lorry , said stryver ; i have a night's work to do yet .
speak for yourself .
i speak for myself , answered mr. lorry , and for mr. darnay , and for miss lucie , andmiss lucie , do you not think i may speak for us all ?
he asked her the question pointedly , and with a glance at her father .
his face had become frozen , as it were , in a very curious look at darnay : an intent look , deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust , not even unmixed with fear .
with this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away .
my father , said lucie , softly laying her hand on his .
he slowly shook the shadow off , and turned to her .
shall we go home , my father ?
with a long breath , he answered yes .
the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed , under the impressionwhich he himself had originatedthat he would not be released that night .
the lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages , the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle , and the dismal place was deserted until tomorrow morning's interest of gallows , pillory , whippingpost , and brandingiron , should repeople it .
walking between her father and mr. darnay , lucie manette passed into the open air .
a hackneycoach was called , and the father and daughter departed in it .
mr. stryver had left them in the passages , to shoulder his way back to the robingroom .
another person , who had not joined the group , or interchanged a word with any one of them , but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest , had silently strolled out after the rest , and had looked on until the coach drove away .
he now stepped up to where mr. lorry and mr. darnay stood upon the pavement .
so , mr. lorry !
men of business may speak to mr. darnay now ?
nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr. carton's part in the day's proceedings ; nobody had known of it .
he was unrobed , and was none the better for it in appearance .
if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind , when the business mind is divided between goodnatured impulse and business appearances , you would be amused , mr. darnay .
mr. lorry reddened , and said , warmly , you have mentioned that before , sir .
we men of business , who serve a house , are not our own masters .
we have to think of the house more than ourselves .
i know , i know , rejoined mr. carton , carelessly .
don't be nettled , mr. lorry .
you are as good as another , i have no doubt : better , i dare say .
and indeed , sir , pursued mr. lorry , not minding him , i really don't know what you have to do with the matter .
if you'll excuse me , as very much your elder , for saying so , i really don't know that it is your business .
business !
bless you , i have no business , said mr. carton .
it is a pity you have not , sir .
i think so , too .
if you had , pursued mr. lorry , perhaps you would attend to it .
lord love you , no !
ishouldn't , said mr. carton .
well , sir !
cried mr. lorry , thoroughly heated by his indifference , business is a very good thing , and a very respectable thing .
and , sir , if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments , mr. darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance .
mr. darnay , good night , god bless you , sir !
i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life .
chairthere !
perhaps a little angry with himself , as well as with the barrister , mr. lorry bustled into the chair , and was carried off to tellson's .
carton , who smelt of port wine , and did not appear to be quite sober , laughed then , and turned to darnay : this is a strange chance that throws you and me together .
this must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones ?
i hardly seem yet , returned charles darnay , to belong to this world again .
i don't wonder at it ; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another .
you speak faintly .
i begin to think i am faint .
then why the devil don't you dine ?
i dined , myself , while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong tothis , or some other .
let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at .
drawing his arm through his own , he took him down ludgatehill to fleetstreet , and so , up a covered way , into a tavern .
here , they were shown into a little room , where charles darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine : while carton sat opposite to him at the same table , with his separate bottle of port before him , and his fully halfinsolent manner upon him .
do you feel , yet , that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again , mr. darnay ?
i am frightfully confused regarding time and place ; but i am so far mended as to feel that .
it must be an immense satisfaction !
he said it bitterly , and filled up his glass again : which was a large one .
as to me , the greatest desire i have , is to forget that i belong to it .
it has no good in it for meexcept wine like thisnor i for it .
so we are not much alike in that particular .
indeed , i begin to think we are not much alike in any particular , you and i .
confused by the emotion of the day , and feeling his being there with this double of coarse deportment , to be like a dream , charles darnay was at a loss how to answer ; finally , answered not at all .
now your dinner is done , carton presently said , why don't you call a health , mr. darnay ; why don't you give your toast ?
what health ?
what toast ?
why , it's on the tip of your tongue .
it ought to be , it must be , i'll swear it's there .
miss manette , then !
miss manette , then !
looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast , carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall , where it shivered to pieces ; then , rang the bell , and ordered in another .
that's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark , mr. darnay !
he said , filling his new goblet .
a slight frown and a laconic yes , were the answer .
that's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by !
how does it feel ?
is it worth being tried for one's life , to be the object of such sympathy and compassion , mr. darnay ?
again darnay answered not a word .
she was mightily pleased to have your message , when i gave it her .
not that she showed she was pleased , but i suppose she was .
the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this disagreeable companion had , of his own free will , assisted him in the strait of the day .
he turned the dialogue to that point , and thanked him for it .
i neither want any thanks , nor merit any , was the careless rejoinder .
it was nothing to do , in the first place ; and i don't know why i did it , in the second .
mr. darnay , let me ask you a question .
willingly , and a small return for your good offices .
do you think i particularly like you ?
really , mr. carton , returned the other , oddly disconcerted , i have not asked myself the question .
but ask yourself the question now .
you have acted as if you do ; but i don't think you do .
i don't think i do , said carton .
i begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding .
nevertheless , pursued darnay , rising to ring the bell , there is nothing in that , i hope , to prevent my calling the reckoning , and our parting without illblood on either side .
carton rejoining , nothing in life !
darnay rang .
do you call the whole reckoning ?
said carton .
on his answering in the affirmative , then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten .
the bill being paid , charles darnay rose and wished him good night .
without returning the wish , carton rose too , with something of a threat of defiance in his manner , and said , a last word , mr. darnay : you think i am drunk ?
i think you have been drinking , mr. carton .
think ?
you know i have been drinking .
since i must say so , i know it .
then you shall likewise know why .
i am a disappointed drudge , sir .
i care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me .
much to be regretted .
you might have used your talents better .
may be so , mr. darnay ; may be not .
don't let your sober face elate you , however ; you don't know what it may come to .
good night !
when he was left alone , this strange being took up a candle , went to a glass that hung against the wall , and surveyed himself minutely in it .
do you particularly like the man ?
he muttered , at his own image ; why should you particularly like a man who resembles you ?
there is nothing in you to like ; you know that .
ah , confound you !
what a change you have made in yourself !
a good reason for taking to a man , that he shows you what you have fallen away from , and what you might have been !
change places with him , and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was , and commiserated by that agitated face as he was ?
come on , and have it out in plain words !
you hate the fellow .
he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation , drank it all in a few minutes , and fell asleep on his arms , with his hair straggling over the table , and a long windingsheet in the candle dripping down upon him .
those were drinking days , and most men drank hard .
so very great is the improvement time has brought about in such habits , that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night , without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman , would seem , in these days , a ridiculous exaggeration .
the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities ; neither was mr. stryver , already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice , behind his compeers in this particular , any more than in the drier parts of the legal race .
a favourite at the old bailey , and eke at the sessions , mr. stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted .
sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite , specially , to their longing arms ; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the lord chief justice in the court of king's bench , the florid countenance of mr. stryver might be daily seen , bursting out of the bed of wigs , like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions .
it had once been noted at the bar , that while mr. stryver was a glib man , and an unscrupulous , and a ready , and a bold , he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements , which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments .
but , a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this .
the more business he got , the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow ; and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney carton , he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning .
sydney carton , idlest and most unpromising of men , was stryver's great ally .
what the two drank together , between hilary term and michaelmas , might have floated a king's ship .
stryver never had a case in hand , anywhere , but carton was there , with his hands in his pockets , staring at the ceiling of the court ; they went the same circuit , and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night , and carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day , going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings , like a dissipated cat .
at last , it began to get about , among such as were interested in the matter , that although sydney carton would never be a lion , he was an amazingly good jackal , and that he rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity .
ten o'clock , sir , said the man at the tavern , whom he had charged to wake himten o'clock , sir .
what's the matter ?
ten o'clock , sir .
what do you mean ?
ten o'clock at night ?
yes , sir .
your honour told me to call you .
oh !
i remember .
very well , very well .
after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again , which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes , he got up , tossed his hat on , and walked out .
he turned into the temple , and , having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of king's benchwalk and paperbuildings , turned into the stryver chambers .
the stryver clerk , who never assisted at these conferences , had gone home , and the stryver principal opened the door .
he had his slippers on , and a loose bedgown , and his throat was bare for his greater ease .
he had that rather wild , strained , seared marking about the eyes , which may be observed in all free livers of his class , from the portrait of jeffries downward , and which can be traced , under various disguises of art , through the portraits of every drinking age .
you are a little late , memory , said stryver .
about the usual time ; it may be a quarter of an hour later .
they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers , where there was a blazing fire .
a kettle steamed upon the hob , and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone , with plenty of wine upon it , and brandy , and rum , and sugar , and lemons .
you have had your bottle , i perceive , sydney .
two tonight , i think .
i have been dining with the day's client ; or seeing him dineit's all one !
that was a rare point , sydney , that you brought to bear upon the identification .
how did you come by it ?
when did it strike you ?
i thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and i thought i should have been much the same sort of fellow , if i had had any luck .
mr. stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch .
you and your luck , sydney !
get to work , get to work .
sullenly enough , the jackal loosened his dress , went into an adjoining room , and came back with a large jug of cold water , a basin , and a towel or two .
steeping the towels in the water , and partially wringing them out , he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold , sat down at the table , and said , now i am ready !
not much boiling down to be done tonight , memory , said mr. stryver , gaily , as he looked among his papers .
how much ?
only two sets of them .
give me the worst first .
there they are , sydney .
fire away !
the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinkingtable , while the jackal sat at his own paperbestrewn table proper , on the other side of it , with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand .
both resorted to the drinkingtable without stint , but each in a different way ; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband , looking at the fire , or occasionally flirting with some lighter document ; the jackal , with knitted brows and intent face , so deep in his task , that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glasswhich often groped about , for a minute or more , before it found the glass for his lips .
two or three times , the matter in hand became so knotty , that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up , and steep his towels anew .
from these pilgrimages to the jug and basin , he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe ; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity .
at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion , and proceeded to offer it to him .
the lion took it with care and caution , made his selections from it , and his remarks upon it , and the jackal assisted both .
when the repast was fully discussed , the lion put his hands in his waistband again , and lay down to meditate .
the jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle , and a fresh application to his head , and applied himself to the collection of a second meal ; this was administered to the lion in the same manner , and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning .
and now we have done , sydney , fill a bumper of punch , said mr. stryver .
the jackal removed the towels from his head , which had been steaming again , shook himself , yawned , shivered , and complied .
you were very sound , sydney , in the matter of those crown witnesses today .
every question told .
i always am sound ; am i not ?
i don't gainsay it .
what has roughened your temper ?
put some punch to it and smooth it again .
with a deprecatory grunt , the jackal again complied .
the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school , said stryver , nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past , the old seesaw sydney .
up one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in despondency !
ah !
returned the other , sighing : yes !
the same sydney , with the same luck .
even then , i did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own .
and why not ?
god knows .
it was my way , i suppose .
he sat , with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him , looking at the fire .
carton , said his friend , squaring himself at him with a bullying air , as if the firegrate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged , and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it , your way is , and always was , a lame way .
you summon no energy and purpose .
look at me .
oh , botheration !
returned sydney , with a lighter and more goodhumoured laugh , don't you be moral !
how have i done what i have done ?
said stryver ; how do i do what i do ?
partly through paying me to help you , i suppose .
but it's not worth your while to apostrophise me , or the air , about it ; what you want to do , you do .
you were always in the front rank , and i was always behind .
i had to get into the front rank ; i was not born there , was i ?
i was not present at the ceremony ; but my opinion is you were , said carton .
at this , he laughed again , and they both laughed .
before shrewsbury , and at shrewsbury , and ever since shrewsbury , pursued carton , you have fallen into your rank , and i have fallen into mine .
even when we were fellowstudents in the studentquarter of paris , picking up french , and french law , and other french crumbs that we didn't get much good of , you were always somewhere , and i was always nowhere .
and whose fault was that ?
upon my soul , i am not sure that it was not yours .
you were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing , to that restless degree that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose .
it's a gloomy thing , however , to talk about one's own past , with the day breaking .
turn me in some other direction before i go .
well then !
pledge me to the pretty witness , said stryver , holding up his glass .
are you turned in a pleasant direction ?
apparently not , for he became gloomy again .
pretty witness , he muttered , looking down into his glass .
i have had enough of witnesses today and tonight ; who's your pretty witness ?
the picturesque doctor's daughter , miss manette .
she pretty ?
is she not ?
no .
why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole court !
rot the admiration of the whole court !
who made the old bailey a judge of beauty ?
she was a goldenhaired doll !
do you know , sydney , said mr. stryver , looking at him with sharp eyes , and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face : do you know , i rather thought , at the time , that you sympathised with the goldenhaired doll , and were quick to see what happened to the goldenhaired doll ?
quick to see what happened !
if a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose , he can see it without a perspectiveglass .
i pledge you , but i deny the beauty .
and now i'll have no more drink ; i'll get to bed .
when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle , to light him down the stairs , the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows .
when he got out of the house , the air was cold and sad , the dull sky overcast , the river dark and dim , the whole scene like a lifeless desert .
and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast , as if the desertsand had risen far away , and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city .
waste forces within him , and a desert all around , this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace , and saw for a moment , lying in the wilderness before him , a mirage of honourable ambition , selfdenial , and perseverance .
in the fair city of this vision , there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him , gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening , waters of hope that sparkled in his sight .
a moment , and it was gone .
climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses , he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed , and its pillow was wet with wasted tears .
sadly , sadly , the sun rose ; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions , incapable of their directed exercise , incapable of his own help and his own happiness , sensible of the blight on him , and resigning himself to let it eat him away .
the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet streetcorner not far from sohosquare .
on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason , and carried it , as to the public interest and memory , far out to sea , mr. jarvis lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived , on his way to dine with the doctor .
after several relapses into businessabsorption , mr. lorry had become the doctor's friend , and the quiet streetcorner was the sunny part of his life .
on this certain fine sunday , mr. lorry walked towards soho , early in the afternoon , for three reasons of habit .
firstly , because , on fine sundays , he often walked out , before dinner , with the doctor and lucie ; secondly , because , on unfavourable sundays , he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend , talking , reading , looking out of window , and generally getting through the day ; thirdly , because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve , and knew how the ways of the doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them .
a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived , was not to be found in london .
there was no way through it , and the front windows of the doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it .
there were few buildings then , north of the oxfordroad , and foresttrees flourished , and wild flowers grew , and the hawthorn blossomed , in the now vanished fields .
as a consequence , country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom , instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement ; and there was many a good south wall , not far off , on which the peaches ripened in their season .
the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day ; but , when the streets grew hot , the corner was in shadow , though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness .
it was a cool spot , staid but cheerful , a wonderful place for echoes , and a very harbour from the raging streets .
there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage , and there was .
the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house , where several callings purported to be pursued by day , but whereof little was audible any day , and which was shunned by all of them at night .
in a building at the back , attainable by a courtyard where a planetree rustled its green leaves , churchorgans claimed to be made , and silver to be chased , and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hallas if he had beaten himself precious , and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors .
very little of these trades , or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live upstairs , or of a dim coachtrimming maker asserted to have a countinghouse below , was ever heard or seen .
occasionally , a stray workman putting his coat on , traversed the hall , or a stranger peered about there , or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard , or a thump from the golden giant .
these , however , were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the planetree behind the house , and the echoes in the corner before it , had their own way from sunday morning unto saturday night .
doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation , and its revival in the floating whispers of his story , brought him .
his scientific knowledge , and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments , brought him otherwise into moderate request , and he earned as much as he wanted .
these things were within mr. jarvis lorry's knowledge , thoughts , and notice , when he rang the doorbell of the tranquil house in the corner , on the fine sunday afternoon .
doctor manette at home ?
expected home .
miss lucie at home ?
expected home .
miss pross at home ?
possibly at home , but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of miss pross , as to admission or denial of the fact .
as i am at home myself , said mr. lorry , i'll go upstairs .
although the doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth , she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means , which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics .
simple as the furniture was , it was set off by so many little adornments , of no value but for their taste and fancy , that its effect was delightful .
the disposition of everything in the rooms , from the largest object to the least ; the arrangement of colours , the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles , by delicate hands , clear eyes , and good sense ; were at once so pleasant in themselves , and so expressive of their originator , that , as mr. lorry stood looking about him , the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him , with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time , whether he approved ?
there were three rooms on a floor , and , the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all , mr. lorry , smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him , walked from one to another .
the first was the best room , and in it were lucie's birds , and flowers , and books , and desk , and worktable , and box of watercolours ; the second was the doctor's consultingroom , used also as the diningroom ; the third , changingly speckled by the rustle of the planetree in the yard , was the doctor's bedroom , and there , in a corner , stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools , much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wineshop , in the suburb of saint antoine in paris .
i wonder , said mr. lorry , pausing in his looking about , that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him !
and why wonder at that ?
was the abrupt inquiry that made him start .
it proceeded from miss pross , the wild red woman , strong of hand , whose acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover , and had since improved .
i should have thought mr. lorry began .
pooh !
you'd have thought !
said miss pross ; and mr. lorry left off .
how do you do ?
inquired that lady thensharply , and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice .
i am pretty well , i thank you , answered mr. lorry , with meekness ; how are you ?
nothing to boast of , said miss pross .
indeed ?
ah !
indeed !
said miss pross .
i am very much put out about my ladybird .
indeed ?
for gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed ,' or you'll fidget me to death , said miss pross : whose character dissociated from stature was shortness .
really , then ?
said mr. lorry , as an amendment .
really , is bad enough , returned miss pross , but better .
yes , i am very much put out .
may i ask the cause ?
i don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird , to come here looking after her , said miss pross .
do dozens come for that purpose ?
hundreds , said miss pross .
it was characteristic of this lady as of some other people before her time and since that whenever her original proposition was questioned , she exaggerated it .
dear me !
said mr. lorry , as the safest remark he could think of .
i have lived with the darlingor the darling has lived with me , and paid me for it ; which she certainly should never have done , you may take your affidavit , if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothingsince she was ten years old .
and it's really very hard , said miss pross .
not seeing with precision what was very hard , mr. lorry shook his head ; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything .
all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet , are always turning up , said miss pross .
when you began it i began it , miss pross ?
didn't you ?
who brought her father to life ?
oh !
if that was beginning it said mr. lorry .
it wasn't ending it , i suppose ?
i say , when you began it , it was hard enough ; not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette , except that he is not worthy of such a daughter , which is no imputation on him , for it was not to be expected that anybody should be , under any circumstances .
but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him i could have forgiven him , to take ladybird's affections away from me .
mr. lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous , but he also knew her by this time to be , beneath the service of her eccentricity , one of those unselfish creaturesfound only among womenwho will , for pure love and admiration , bind themselves willing slaves , to youth when they have lost it , to beauty that they never had , to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain , to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives .
he knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart ; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint , he had such an exalted respect for it , that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mindwe all make such arrangements , more or lesshe stationed miss pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by nature and art , who had balances at tellson's .
there never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of ladybird , said miss pross ; and that was my brother solomon , if he hadn't made a mistake in life .
here again : mr. lorry's inquiries into miss pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed , as a stake to speculate with , and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore , with no touch of compunction .
miss pross's fidelity of belief in solomon deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake was quite a serious matter with mr. lorry , and had its weight in his good opinion of her .
as we happen to be alone for the moment , and are both people of business , he said , when they had got back to the drawingroom and had sat down there in friendly relations , let me ask youdoes the doctor , in talking with lucie , never refer to the shoemaking time , yet ?
never .
and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him ?
ah !
returned miss pross , shaking her head .
but i don't say he don't refer to it within himself .
do you believe that he thinks of it much ?
i do , said miss pross .
do you imagine mr. lorry had begun , when miss pross took him up short with : never imagine anything .
have no imagination at all .
i stand corrected ; do you supposeyou go so far as to suppose , sometimes ?
now and then , said miss pross .
do you suppose , mr. lorry went on , with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye , as it looked kindly at her , that doctor manette has any theory of his own , preserved through all those years , relative to the cause of his being so oppressed ; perhaps , even to the name of his oppressor ?
i don't suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me .
and that is ?
that she thinks he has .
now don't be angry at my asking all these questions ; because i am a mere dull man of business , and you are a woman of business .
dull ?
miss pross inquired , with placidity .
rather wishing his modest adjective away , mr. lorry replied , no , no , no .
surely not .
to return to business :is it not remarkable that doctor manette , unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is , should never touch upon that question ?
i will not say with me , though he had business relations with me many years ago , and we are now intimate ; i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached , and who is so devotedly attached to him ?
believe me , miss pross , i don't approach the topic with you , out of curiosity , but out of zealous interest .
well !
to the best of my understanding , and bad's the best , you'll tell me , said miss pross , softened by the tone of the apology , he is afraid of the whole subject .
afraid ?
it's plain enough , i should think , why he may be .
it's a dreadful remembrance .
besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it .
not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again .
that alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant , i should think .
it was a profounder remark than mr. lorry had looked for .
true , said he , and fearful to reflect upon .
yet , a doubt lurks in my mind , miss pross , whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression always shut up within him .
indeed , it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence .
can't be helped , said miss pross , shaking her head .
touch that string , and he instantly changes for the worse .
better leave it alone .
in short , must leave it alone , like or no like .
sometimes , he gets up in the dead of the night , and will be heard , by us overhead there , walking up and down , walking up and down , in his room .
ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down , walking up and down , in his old prison .
she hurries to him , and they go on together , walking up and down , walking up and down , until he is composed .
but he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness , to her , and she finds it best not to hint at it to him .
in silence they go walking up and down together , walking up and down together , till her love and company have brought him to himself .
notwithstanding miss pross's denial of her own imagination , there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea , in her repetition of the phrase , walking up and down , which testified to her possessing such a thing .
the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes ; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going .
here they are !
said miss pross , rising to break up the conference ; and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon !
it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties , such a peculiar ear of a place , that as mr. lorry stood at the open window , looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard , he fancied they would never approach .
not only would the echoes die away , as though the steps had gone ; but , echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead , and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand .
however , father and daughter did at last appear , and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them .
miss pross was a pleasant sight , albeit wild , and red , and grim , taking off her darling's bonnet when she came upstairs , and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief , and blowing the dust off it , and folding her mantle ready for laying by , and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women .
her darling was a pleasant sight too , embracing her and thanking her , and protesting against her taking so much trouble for herwhich last she only dared to do playfully , or miss pross , sorely hurt , would have retired to her own chamber and cried .
the doctor was a pleasant sight too , looking on at them , and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie , in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had , and would have had more if it were possible .
mr. lorry was a pleasant sight too , beaming at all this in his little wig , and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home .
but , no hundreds of people came to see the sights , and mr. lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss pross's prediction .
dinnertime , and still no hundreds of people .
in the arrangements of the little household , miss pross took charge of the lower regions , and always acquitted herself marvellously .
her dinners , of a very modest quality , were so well cooked and so well served , and so neat in their contrivances , half english and half french , that nothing could be better .
miss pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind , she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces , in search of impoverished french , who , tempted by shillings and halfcrowns , would impart culinary mysteries to her .
from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul , she had acquired such wonderful arts , that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress , or cinderella's godmother : who would send out for a fowl , a rabbit , a vegetable or two from the garden , and change them into anything she pleased .
on sundays , miss pross dined at the doctor's table , but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods , either in the lower regions , or in her own room on the second floora blue chamber , to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance .
on this occasion , miss pross , responding to ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , unbent exceedingly ; so the dinner was very pleasant , too .
it was an oppressive day , and , after dinner , lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the planetree , and they should sit there in the air .
as everything turned upon her , and revolved about her , they went out under the planetree , and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr. lorry .
she had installed herself , some time before , as mr. lorry's cupbearer ; and while they sat under the planetree , talking , she kept his glass replenished .
mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked , and the planetree whispered to them in its own way above their heads .
still , the hundreds of people did not present themselves .
mr. darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the planetree , but he was only one .
doctor manette received him kindly , and so did lucie .
but , miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body , and retired into the house .
she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder , and she called it , in familiar conversation , a fit of the jerks .
the doctor was in his best condition , and looked specially young .
the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times , and as they sat side by side , she leaning on his shoulder , and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very agreeable to trace the likeness .
he had been talking all day , on many subjects , and with unusual vivacity .
pray , doctor manette , said mr. darnay , as they sat under the planetreeand he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand , which happened to be the old buildings of londonhave you seen much of the tower ?
lucie and i have been there ; but only casually .
we have seen enough of it , to know that it teems with interest ; little more .
i have been there , as you remember , said darnay , with a smile , though reddening a little angrily , in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it .
they told me a curious thing when i was there .
what was that ?
lucie asked .
in making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten .
every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisonersdates , names , complaints , and prayers .
upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall , one prisoner , who seemed to have gone to execution , had cut as his last work , three letters .
they were done with some very poor instrument , and hurriedly , with an unsteady hand .
at first , they were read as d .
i .
c .
 ;but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be g .
there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been .
at length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , dig .
the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription , and , in the earth beneath a stone , or tile , or some fragment of paving , were found the ashes of a paper , mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag .
what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler .
my father , exclaimed lucie , you are ill !
he had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head .
his manner and his look quite terrified them all .
no , my dear , not ill .
there are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start .
we had better go in .
he recovered himself almost instantly .
rain was really falling in large drops , and he showed the back of his hand with raindrops on it .
but , he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of , and , as they went into the house , the business eye of mr. lorry either detected , or fancied it detected , on his face , as it turned towards charles darnay , the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house .
he recovered himself so quickly , however , that mr. lorry had doubts of his business eye .
the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was , when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be , and that the rain had startled him .
teatime , and miss pross making tea , with another fit of the jerks upon her , and yet no hundreds of people .
mr. carton had lounged in , but he made only two .
the night was so very sultry , that although they sat with doors and windows open , they were overpowered by heat .
when the teatable was done with , they all moved to one of the windows , and looked out into the heavy twilight .
lucie sat by her father ; darnay sat beside her ; carton leaned against a window .
the curtains were long and white , and some of the thundergusts that whirled into the corner , caught them up to the ceiling , and waved them like spectral wings .
the raindrops are still falling , large , heavy , and few , said doctor manette .
it comes slowly .
it comes surely , said carton .
they spoke low , as people watching and waiting mostly do ; as people in a dark room , watching and waiting for lightning , always do .
there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke ; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there .
a multitude of people , and yet a solitude !
said darnay , when they had listened for a while .
is it not impressive , mr. darnay ?
asked lucie .
sometimes , i have sat here of an evening , until i have fanciedbut even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight , when all is so black and solemn let us shudder too .
we may know what it is .
it will seem nothing to you .
such whims are only impressive as we originate them , i think ; they are not to be communicated .
i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming byandbye into our lives .
there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , sydney carton struck in , in his moody way .
the footsteps were incessant , and the hurry of them became more and more rapid .
the corner echoed and reechoed with the tread of feet ; some , as it seemed , under the windows ; some , as it seemed , in the room ; some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether ; all in the distant streets , and not one within sight .
are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us , miss manette , or are we to divide them among us ?
i don't know , mr. darnay ; i told you it was a foolish fancy , but you asked for it .
when i have yielded myself to it , i have been alone , and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life , and my father's .
i take them into mine !
said carton .
i ask no questions and make no stipulations .
there is a great crowd bearing down upon us , miss manette , and i see themby the lightning .
he added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window .
and i hear them !
he added again , after a peal of thunder .
here they come , fast , fierce , and furious !
it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it .
a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment's interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after the moon rose at midnight .
the great bell of saint paul's was striking one in the cleared air , when mr. lorry , escorted by jerry , highbooted and bearing a lantern , set forth on his returnpassage to clerkenwell .
there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell , and mr. lorry , mindful of footpads , always retained jerry for this service : though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier .
what a night it has been !
almost a night , jerry , said mr. lorry , to bring the dead out of their graves .
i never see the night myself , masternor yet i don't expect towhat would do that , answered jerry .
good night , mr. carton , said the man of business .
good night , mr. darnay .
shall we ever see such a night again , together !
perhaps .
perhaps , see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too .
monseigneur , one of the great lords in power at the court , held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris .
monseigneur was in his inner room , his sanctuary of sanctuaries , the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without .
monseigneur was about to take his chocolate .
monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease , and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france ; but , his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur , without the aid of four strong men besides the cook .
yes .
it took four men , all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration , and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket , emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur , to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur's lips .
one lacquey carried the chocolatepot into the sacred presence ; a second , milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function ; a third , presented the favoured napkin ; a fourth he of the two gold watches , poured the chocolate out .
it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens .
deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men ; he must have died of two .
monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night , where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented .
monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights , with fascinating company .
so polite and so impressible was monseigneur , that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets , than the needs of all france .
a happy circumstance for france , as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured !
alwayswas for england by way of example , in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it .
monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way ; of particular public business , monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his waytend to his own power and pocket .
of his pleasures , general and particular , monseigneur had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them .
the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun , which is not much ran : the earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith monseigneur .
yet , monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs , both private and public ; and he had , as to both classes of affairs , allied himself perforce with a farmergeneral .
as to finances public , because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them , and must consequently let them out to somebody who could ; as to finances private , because farmergenerals were rich , and monseigneur , after generations of great luxury and expense , was growing poor .
hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent , while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil , the cheapest garment she could wear , and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmergeneral , poor in family .
which farmergeneral , carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it , was now among the company in the outer rooms , much prostrated before by mankindalways excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur , who , his own wife included , looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt .
a sumptuous man was the farmergeneral .
thirty horses stood in his stables , twentyfour male domestics sat in his halls , six bodywomen waited on his wife .
as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could , the farmergeneralhowsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social moralitywas at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day .
for , the rooms , though a beautiful scene to look at , and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve , were , in truth , not a sound business ; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off , either , but that the watching towers of notre dame , almost equidistant from the two extremes , could see them both , they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable businessif that could have been anybody's business , at the house of monseigneur .
military officers destitute of military knowledge ; naval officers with no idea of a ship ; civil officers without a notion of affairs ; brazen ecclesiastics , of the worst world worldly , with sensual eyes , loose tongues , and looser lives ; all totally unfit for their several callings , all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them , but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur , and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got ; these were to be told off by the score and the score .
people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state , yet equally unconnected with anything that was real , or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end , were no less abundant .
doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed , smiled upon their courtly patients in the antechambers of monseigneur .
projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched , except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin , poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of , at the reception of monseigneur .
unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words , and making cardtowers of babel to scale the skies with , talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals , at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur .
exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable timeand has been sinceto be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion , at the hotel of monseigneur .
such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris , that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneurforming a goodly half of the polite companywould have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a mother .
indeed , except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this worldwhich does not go far towards the realisation of the name of motherthere was no such thing known to the fashion .
peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close , and brought them up , and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty .
the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur .
in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had , for a few years , some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong .
as a promising way of setting them right , half of the halfdozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists , and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam , rage , roar , and turn cataleptic on the spotthereby setting up a highly intelligible fingerpost to the future , for monseigneur's guidance .
besides these dervishes , were other three who had rushed into another sect , which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth : holding that man had got out of the centre of truthwhich did not need much demonstrationbut had not got out of the circumference , and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference , and was even to be shoved back into the centre , by fasting and seeing of spirits .
among these , accordingly , much discoursing with spirits went onand it did a world of good which never became manifest .
but , the comfort was , that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed .
if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day , everybody there would have been eternally correct .
such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair , such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended , such gallant swords to look at , and such delicate honour to the sense of smell , would surely keep anything going , for ever and ever .
the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved ; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells ; and what with that ringing , and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen , there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away .
dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places .
everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off .
from the palace of the tuileries , through monseigneur and the whole court , through the chambers , the tribunals of justice , and all society except the scarecrows , the fancy ball descended to the common executioner : who , in pursuance of the charm , was required to officiate frizzled , powdered , in a goldlaced coat , pumps , and white silk stockings .
at the gallows and the wheelthe axe was a raritymonsieur paris , as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces , monsieur orleans , and the rest , to call him , presided in this dainty dress .
and who among the company at monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord , could possibly doubt , that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman , powdered , goldlaced , pumped , and whitesilk stockinged , would see the very stars out !
monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate , caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open , and issued forth .
then , what submission , what cringing and fawning , what servility , what abject humiliation !
as to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for heavenwhich may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it .
bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there , a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another , monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth .
there , monseigneur turned , and came back again , and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites , and was seen no more .
the show being over , the flutter in the air became quite a little storm , and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs .
there was soon but one person left of all the crowd , and he , with his hat under his arm and his snuffbox in his hand , slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out .
i devote you , said this person , stopping at the last door on his way , and turning in the direction of the sanctuary , to the devil !
with that , he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet , and quietly walked downstairs .
he was a man of about sixty , handsomely dressed , haughty in manner , and with a face like a fine mask .
a face of a transparent paleness ; every feature in it clearly defined ; one set expression on it .
the nose , beautifully formed otherwise , was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril .
in those two compressions , or dints , the only little change that the face ever showed , resided .
they persisted in changing colour sometimes , and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation ; then , they gave a look of treachery , and cruelty , to the whole countenance .
examined with attention , its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth , and the lines of the orbits of the eyes , being much too horizontal and thin ; still , in the effect of the face made , it was a handsome face , and a remarkable one .
its owner went downstairs into the courtyard , got into his carriage , and drove away .
not many people had talked with him at the reception ; he had stood in a little space apart , and monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner .
it appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often barely escaping from being run down .
his man drove as if he were charging an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master .
the complaint had sometimes made itself audible , even in that deaf city and dumb age , that , in the narrow streets without footways , the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner .
but , few cared enough for that to think of it a second time , and , in this matter , as in all others , the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could .
with a wild rattle and clatter , and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days , the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners , with women screaming before it , and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way .
at last , swooping at a street corner by a fountain , one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt , and there was a loud cry from a number of voices , and the horses reared and plunged .
but for the latter inconvenience , the carriage probably would not have stopped ; carriages were often known to drive on , and leave their wounded behind , and why not ?
but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry , and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles .
what has gone wrong ?
said monsieur , calmly looking out .
a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses , and had laid it on the basement of the fountain , and was down in the mud and wet , howling over it like a wild animal .
pardon , monsieur the marquis !
said a ragged and submissive man , it is a child .
why does he make that abominable noise ?
is it his child ?
excuse me , monsieur the marquisit is a pityyes .
the fountain was a little removed ; for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square .
as the tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , monsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his swordhilt .
killed !
shrieked the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him .
dead !
the people closed round , and looked at monsieur the marquis .
there was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger .
neither did the people say anything ; after the first cry , they had been silent , and they remained so .
the voice of the submissive man who had spoken , was flat and tame in its extreme submission .
monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes .
he took out his purse .
it is extraordinary to me , said he , that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children .
one or the other of you is for ever in the way .
how do i know what injury you have done my horses .
see !
give him that .
he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up , and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell .
the tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry , dead !
he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way .
on seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the fountain , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it .
they were as silent , however , as the men .
i know all , i know all , said the last comer .
be a brave man , my gaspard !
it is better for the poor little plaything to die so , than to live .
it has died in a moment without pain .
could it have lived an hour as happily ?
you are a philosopher , you there , said the marquis , smiling .
how do they call you ?
they call me defarge .
of what trade ?
monsieur the marquis , vendor of wine .
pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , said the marquis , throwing him another gold coin , and spend it as you will .
the horses there ; are they right ?
without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time , monsieur the marquis leaned back in his seat , and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing , and had paid for it , and could afford to pay for it ; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage , and ringing on its floor .
hold !
said monsieur the marquis .
hold the horses !
who threw that ?
he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood , a moment before ; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot , and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman , knitting .
you dogs !
said the marquis , but smoothly , and with an unchanged front , except as to the spots on his nose : i would ride over any of you very willingly , and exterminate you from the earth .
if i knew which rascal threw at the carriage , and if that brigand were sufficiently near it , he should be crushed under the wheels .
so cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or a hand , or even an eye was raised .
among the men , not one .
but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily , and looked the marquis in the face .
it was not for his dignity to notice it ; his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats ; and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word go on !
he was driven on , and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession ; the minister , the stateprojector , the farmergeneral , the doctor , the lawyer , the ecclesiastic , the grand opera , the comedy , the whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow , came whirling by .
the rats had crept out of their holes to look on , and they remained looking on for hours ; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle , and making a barrier behind which they slunk , and through which they peeped .
the father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it , when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain , sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the fancy ballwhen the one woman who had stood conspicuous , knitting , still knitted on with the steadfastness of fate .
the water of the fountain ran , the swift river ran , the day ran into evening , so much life in the city ran into death according to rule , time and tide waited for no man , the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again , the fancy ball was lighted up at supper , all things ran their course .
a beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not abundant .
patches of poor rye where corn should have been , patches of poor peas and beans , patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat .
on inanimate nature , as on the men and women who cultivated it , a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillinglya dejected disposition to give up , and wither away .
monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage which might have been lighter , conducted by four posthorses and two postilions , fagged up a steep hill .
a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding ; it was not from within ; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his controlthe setting sun .
the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop , that its occupant was steeped in crimson .
it will die out , said monsieur the marquis , glancing at his hands , directly .
in effect , the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment .
when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel , and the carriage slid down hill , with a cinderous smell , in a cloud of dust , the red glow departed quickly ; the sun and the marquis going down together , there was no glow left when the drag was taken off .
but , there remained a broken country , bold and open , a little village at the bottom of the hill , a broad sweep and rise beyond it , a churchtower , a windmill , a forest for the chase , and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison .
round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on , the marquis looked , with the air of one who was coming near home .
the village had its one poor street , with its poor brewery , poor tannery , poor tavern , poor stableyard for relays of posthorses , poor fountain , all usual poor appointments .
it had its poor people too .
all its people were poor , and many of them were sitting at their doors , shredding spare onions and the like for supper , while many were at the fountain , washing leaves , and grasses , and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten .
expressive signs of what made them poor , were not wanting ; the tax for the state , the tax for the church , the tax for the lord , tax local and tax general , were to be paid here and to be paid there , according to solemn inscription in the little village , until the wonder was , that there was any village left unswallowed .
few children were to be seen , and no dogs .
as to the men and women , their choice on earth was stated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it , down in the little village under the mill ; or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag .
heralded by a courier in advance , and by the cracking of his postilions' whips , which twined snakelike about their heads in the evening air , as if he came attended by the furies , monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate .
it was hard by the fountain , and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him .
he looked at them , and saw in them , without knowing it , the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure , that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years .
monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him , as the like of himself had drooped before monseigneur of the courtonly the difference was , that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiatewhen a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group .
bring me hither that fellow !
said the marquis to the courier .
the fellow was brought , cap in hand , and the other fellows closed round to look and listen , in the manner of the people at the paris fountain .
i passed you on the road ?
monseigneur , it is true .
i had the honour of being passed on the road .
coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ?
monseigneur , it is true .
what did you look at , so fixedly ?
monseigneur , i looked at the man .
he stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage .
all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage .
what man , pig ?
and why look there ?
pardon , monseigneur ; he swung by the chain of the shoethe drag .
who ?
demanded the traveller .
monseigneur , the man .
may the devil carry away these idiots !
how do you call the man ?
you know all the men of this part of the country .
who was he ?
your clemency , monseigneur !
he was not of this part of the country .
of all the days of my life , i never saw him .
swinging by the chain ?
to be suffocated ?
with your gracious permission , that was the wonder of it , monseigneur .
his head hanging overlike this !
he turned himself sideways to the carriage , and leaned back , with his face thrown up to the sky , and his head hanging down ; then recovered himself , fumbled with his cap , and made a bow .
what was he like ?
monseigneur , he was whiter than the miller .
all covered with dust , white as a spectre , tall as a spectre !
the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd ; but all eyes , without comparing notes with other eyes , looked at monsieur the marquis .
perhaps , to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience .
truly , you did well , said the marquis , felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him , to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours .
bah !
put him aside , monsieur gabelle !
monsieur gabelle was the postmaster , and some other taxing functionary united ; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination , and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner .
bah !
go aside !
said monsieur gabelle .
lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village tonight , and be sure that his business is honest , gabelle .
monseigneur , i am flattered to devote myself to your orders .
did he run away , fellow ?
whereis that accursed ?
the accursed was already under the carriage with some halfdozen particular friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap .
some halfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out , and presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis .
did the man run away , dolt , when we stopped for the drag ?
monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hillside , head first , as a person plunges into the river .
see to it , gabelle .
go on !
the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep ; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones ; they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate .
the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond , was soon checked by the steepness of the hill .
gradually , it subsided to a foot pace , swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night .
the postilions , with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies , quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips ; the valet walked by the horses ; the courier was audible , trotting on ahead into the dull distance .
at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burialground , with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it ; it was a poor figure in wood , done by some inexperienced rustic carver , but he had studied the figure from the lifehis own life , maybefor it was dreadfully spare and thin .
to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , a woman was kneeling .
she turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the carriagedoor .
it is you , monseigneur !
monseigneur , a petition .
with an exclamation of impatience , but with his unchangeable face , monseigneur looked out .
how , then !
what is it ?
always petitions !
monseigneur .
for the love of the great god !
my husband , the forester .
what of your husband , the forester ?
always the same with you people .
he cannot pay something ?
he has paid all , monseigneur .
he is dead .
well !
he is quiet .
can i restore him to you ?
alas , no , monseigneur !
but he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass .
well ?
monseigneur , there are so many little heaps of poor grass ?
again , well ?
she looked an old woman , but was young .
her manner was one of passionate grief ; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the carriagedoortenderly , caressingly , as if it had been a human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch .
monseigneur , hear me !
monseigneur , hear my petition !
my husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want .
again , well ?
can i feed them ?
monseigneur , the good god knows ; but i don't ask it .
my petition is , that a morsel of stone or wood , with my husband's name , may be placed over him to show where he lies .
otherwise , the place will be quickly forgotten , it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady , i shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass .
monseigneur , they are so many , they increase so fast , there is so much want .
monseigneur !
monseigneur !
the valet had put her away from the door , the carriage had broken into a brisk trot , the postilions had quickened the pace , she was left far behind , and monseigneur , again escorted by the furies , was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau .
the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him , and rose , as the rain falls , impartially , on the dusty , ragged , and toilworn group at the fountain not far away ; to whom the mender of roads , with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing , still enlarged upon his man like a spectre , as long as they could bear it .
by degrees , as they could bear no more , they dropped off one by one , and lights twinkled in little casements ; which lights , as the casements darkened , and more stars came out , seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished .
the shadow of a large highroofed house , and of many overhanging trees , was upon monsieur the marquis by that time ; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau , as his carriage stopped , and the great door of his chateau was opened to him .
monsieur charles , whom i expect ; is he arrived from england ?
monseigneur , not yet .
it was a heavy mass of building , that chateau of monsieur the marquis , with a large stone courtyard before it , and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door .
a stony business altogether , with heavy stone balustrades , and stone urns , and stone flowers , and stone faces of men , and stone heads of lions , in all directions .
as if the gorgon's head had surveyed it , when it was finished , two centuries ago .
up the broad flight of shallow steps , monsieur the marquis , flambeau preceded , went from his carriage , sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees .
all else was so quiet , that the flambeau carried up the steps , and the other flambeau held at the great door , burnt as if they were in a close room of state , instead of being in the open nightair .
other sound than the owl's voice there was none , save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin ; for , it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together , and then heave a long low sigh , and hold their breath again .
the great door clanged behind him , and monsieur the marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boarspears , swords , and knives of the chase ; grimmer with certain heavy ridingrods and ridingwhips , of which many a peasant , gone to his benefactor death , had felt the weight when his lord was angry .
avoiding the larger rooms , which were dark and made fast for the night , monsieur the marquis , with his flambeaubearer going on before , went up the staircase to a door in a corridor .
this thrown open , admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms : his bedchamber and two others .
high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors , great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time , and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country .
the fashion of the last louis but one , of the line that was never to breakthe fourteenth louiswas conspicuous in their rich furniture ; but , it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of france .
a suppertable was laid for two , in the third of the rooms ; a round room , in one of the chateau's four extinguishertopped towers .
a small lofty room , with its window wide open , and the wooden jalousieblinds closed , so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black , alternating with their broad lines of stone colour .
my nephew , said the marquis , glancing at the supper preparation ; they said he was not arrived .
nor was he ; but , he had been expected with monseigneur .
ah !
it is not probable he will arrive tonight ; nevertheless , leave the table as it is .
i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour .
in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready , and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper .
his chair was opposite to the window , and he had taken his soup , and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his lips , when he put it down .
what is that ?
he calmly asked , looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour .
monseigneur ?
that ?
outside the blinds .
open the blinds .
it was done .
well ?
monseigneur , it is nothing .
the trees and the night are all that are here .
the servant who spoke , had thrown the blinds wide , had looked out into the vacant darkness , and stood with that blank behind him , looking round for instructions .
good , said the imperturbable master .
close them again .
that was done too , and the marquis went on with his supper .
he was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels .
it came on briskly , and came up to the front of the chateau .
ask who is arrived .
it was the nephew of monseigneur .
he had been some few leagues behind monseigneur , early in the afternoon .
he had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road .
he had heard of monseigneur , at the postinghouses , as being before him .
he was to be told said monseigneur that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it .
in a little while he came .
he had been known in england as charles darnay .
monseigneur received him in a courtly manner , but they did not shake hands .
you left paris yesterday , sir ?
he said to monseigneur , as he took his seat at table .
yesterday .
and you ?
i come direct .
from london ?
yes .
you have been a long time coming , said the marquis , with a smile .
on the contrary ; i come direct .
pardon me !
i mean , not a long time on the journey ; a long time intending the journey .
i have been detained bythe nephew stopped a moment in his answervarious business .
without doubt , said the polished uncle .
so long as a servant was present , no other words passed between them .
when coffee had been served and they were alone together , the nephew , looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask , opened a conversation .
i have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away .
it carried me into great and unexpected peril ; but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have sustained me .
not to death , said the uncle ; it is not necessary to say , to death .
i doubt , sir , returned the nephew , whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there .
the deepened marks in the nose , and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face , looked ominous as to that ; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring .
indeed , sir , pursued the nephew , for anything i know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me .
no , no , no , said the uncle , pleasantly .
but , however that may be , resumed the nephew , glancing at him with deep distrust , i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means .
my friend , i told you so , said the uncle , with a fine pulsation in the two marks .
do me the favour to recall that i told you so , long ago .
i recall it .
thank you , said the marquisvery sweetly indeed .
his tone lingered in the air , almost like the tone of a musical instrument .
in effect , sir , pursued the nephew , i believe it to be at once your bad fortune , and my good fortune , that has kept me out of a prison in france here .
i do not quite understand , returned the uncle , sipping his coffee .
dare i ask you to explain ?
i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely .
it is possible , said the uncle , with great calmness .
for the honour of the family , i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent .
pray excuse me !
i perceive that , happily for me , the reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , observed the nephew .
i would not say happily , my friend , returned the uncle , with refined politeness ; i would not be sure of that .
a good opportunity for consideration , surrounded by the advantages of solitude , might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself .
but it is useless to discuss the question .
i am , as you say , at a disadvantage .
these little instruments of correction , these gentle aids to the power and honour of families , these slight favours that might so incommode you , are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity .
they are sought by so many , and they are granted comparatively to so few !
it used not to be so , but france in all such things is changed for the worse .
our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar .
from this room , many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged ; in the next room my bedroom , one fellow , to our knowledge , was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughterhis daughter ?
we have lost many privileges ; a new philosophy has become the mode ; and the assertion of our station , in these days , might i do not go so far as to say would , but might cause us real inconvenience .
all very bad , very bad !
the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head ; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself , that great means of regeneration .
we have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , said the nephew , gloomily , that i believe our name to be more detested than any name in france .
let us hope so , said the uncle .
detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low .
there is not , pursued the nephew , in his former tone , a face i can look at , in all this country round about us , which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery .
a compliment , said the marquis , to the grandeur of the family , merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur .
hah !
and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs .
but , when his nephew , leaning an elbow on the table , covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand , the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness , closeness , and dislike , than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference .
repression is the only lasting philosophy .
the dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , observed the marquis , will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , looking up to it , shuts out the sky .
that might not be so long as the marquis supposed .
if a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly , firecharred , plunderwrecked rains .
as for the roof he vaunted , he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new wayto wit , for ever , from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets .
meanwhile , said the marquis , i will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not .
but you must be fatigued .
shall we terminate our conference for the night ?
a moment more .
an hour , if you please .
sir , said the nephew , we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong .
we have done wrong ?
repeated the marquis , with an inquiring smile , and delicately pointing , first to his nephew , then to himself .
our family ; our honourable family , whose honour is of so much account to both of us , in such different ways .
even in my father's time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was .
why need i speak of my father's time , when it is equally yours ?
can i separate my father's twinbrother , joint inheritor , and next successor , from himself ?
death has done that !
said the marquis .
and has left me , answered the nephew , bound to a system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but powerless in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes , which implored me to have mercy and to redress ; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain .
seeking them from me , my nephew , said the marquis , touching him on the breast with his forefingerthey were now standing by the hearthyou will for ever seek them in vain , be assured .
every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face , was cruelly , craftily , and closely compressed , while he stood looking quietly at his nephew , with his snuffbox in his hand .
once again he touched him on the breast , as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword , with which , in delicate finesse , he ran him through the body , and said , my friend , i will die , perpetuating the system under which i have lived .
when he had said it , he took a culminating pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket .
better to be a rational creature , he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , and accept your natural destiny .
but you are lost , monsieur charles , i see .
this property and france are lost to me , said the nephew , sadly ; i renounce them .
are they both yours to renounce ?
france may be , but is the property ?
it is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ?
i had no intention , in the words i used , to claim it yet .
if it passed to me from you , tomorrow which i have the vanity to hope is not probable .
or twenty years hence you do me too much honour , said the marquis ; still , i prefer that supposition .
i would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere .
it is little to relinquish .
what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin !
hah !
said the marquis , glancing round the luxurious room .
to the eye it is fair enough , here ; but seen in its integrity , under the sky , and by the daylight , it is a crumbling tower of waste , mismanagement , extortion , debt , mortgage , oppression , hunger , nakedness , and suffering .
hah !
said the marquis again , in a wellsatisfied manner .
if it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly if such a thing is possible from the weight that drags it down , so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance , may , in another generation , suffer less ; but it is not for me .
there is a curse on it , and on all this land .
and you ?
said the uncle .
forgive my curiosity ; do you , under your new philosophy , graciously intend to live ?
i must do , to live , what others of my countrymen , even with nobility at their backs , may have to do some daywork .
in england , for example ?
yes .
the family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country .
the family name can suffer from me in no other , for i bear it in no other .
the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bedchamber to be lighted .
it now shone brightly , through the door of communication .
the marquis looked that way , and listened for the retreating step of his valet .
england is very attractive to you , seeing how indifferently you have prospered there , he observed then , turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile .
i have already said , that for my prospering there , i am sensible i may be indebted to you , sir .
for the rest , it is my refuge .
they say , those boastful english , that it is the refuge of many .
you know a compatriot who has found a refuge there ?
a doctor ?
yes .
with a daughter ?
yes .
yes , said the marquis .
you are fatigued .
good night !
as he bent his head in his most courtly manner , there was a secrecy in his smiling face , and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words , which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly .
at the same time , the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the markings in the nose , curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic .
yes , repeated the marquis .
a doctor with a daughter .
yes .
so commences the new philosophy !
you are fatigued .
good night !
it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his .
the nephew looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door .
good night !
said the uncle .
i look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning .
good repose !
light monsieur my nephew to his chamber there !
andburn monsieur my nephew in his bed , if you will , he added to himself , before he rang his little bell again , and summoned his valet to his own bedroom .
the valet come and gone , monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamberrobe , to prepare himself gently for sleep , that hot still night .
rustling about the room , his softlyslippered feet making no noise on the floor , he moved like a refined tiger :looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort , in story , whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off , or just coming on .
he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom , looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind ; the slow toil up the hill at sunset , the setting sun , the descent , the mill , the prison on the crag , the little village in the hollow , the peasants at the fountain , and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage .
that fountain suggested the paris fountain , the little bundle lying on the step , the women bending over it , and the tall man with his arms up , crying , dead !
i am cool now , said monsieur the marquis , and may go to bed .
so , leaving only one light burning on the large hearth , he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him , and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep .
the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours ; for three heavy hours , the horses in the stables rattled at their racks , the dogs barked , and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by menpoets .
but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them .
for three heavy hours , the stone faces of the chateau , lion and human , stared blindly at the night .
dead darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads .
the burialplace had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another ; the figure on the cross might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it .
in the village , taxers and taxed were fast asleep .
dreaming , perhaps , of banquets , as the starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven slave and the yoked ox may , its lean inhabitants slept soundly , and were fed and freed .
the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard , and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheardboth melting away , like the minutes that were falling from the spring of timethrough three dark hours .
then , the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light , and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened .
lighter and lighter , until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees , and poured its radiance over the hill .
in the glow , the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood , and the stone faces crimsoned .
the carol of the birds was loud and high , and , on the weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of monsieur the marquis , one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might .
at this , the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed , and , with open mouth and dropped underjaw , looked awestricken .
now , the sun was full up , and movement began in the village .
casement windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth shiveringchilled , as yet , by the new sweet air .
then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population .
some , to the fountain ; some , to the fields ; men and women here , to dig and delve ; men and women there , to see to the poor live stock , and lead the bony cows out , to such pasture as could be found by the roadside .
in the church and at the cross , a kneeling figure or two ; attendant on the latter prayers , the led cow , trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot .
the chateau awoke later , as became its quality , but awoke gradually and surely .
first , the lonely boarspears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old ; then , had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine ; now , doors and windows were thrown open , horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways , leaves sparkled and rustled at irongrated windows , dogs pulled hard at their chains , and reared impatient to be loosed .
all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life , and the return of morning .
surely , not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau , nor the running up and down the stairs ; nor the hurried figures on the terrace ; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere , nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away ?
what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads , already at work on the hilltop beyond the village , with his day's dinner not much to carry lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at , on a heap of stones ?
had the birds , carrying some grains of it to a distance , dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds ?
whether or no , the mender of roads ran , on the sultry morning , as if for his life , down the hill , kneehigh in dust , and never stopped till he got to the fountain .
all the people of the village were at the fountain , standing about in their depressed manner , and whispering low , but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise .
the led cows , hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them , were looking stupidly on , or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble , which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter .
some of the people of the chateau , and some of those of the postinghouse , and all the taxing authorities , were armed more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way , that was highly fraught with nothing .
already , the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends , and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap .
what did all this portend , and what portended the swift hoistingup of monsieur gabelle behind a servant on horseback , and the conveying away of the said gabelle doubleladen though the horse was , at a gallop , like a new version of the german ballad of leonora ?
it portended that there was one stone face too many , up at the chateau .
the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added the one stone face wanting ; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years .
it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis .
it was like a fine mask , suddenly startled , made angry , and petrified .
driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it , was a knife .
round its hilt was a frill of paper , on which was scrawled : drive him fast to his tomb .
this , from jacques .
more months , to the number of twelve , had come and gone , and mr. charles darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french language who was conversant with french literature .
in this age , he would have been a professor ; in that age , he was a tutor .
he read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world , and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy .
he could write of them , besides , in sound english , and render them into sound english .
such masters were not at that time easily found ; princes that had been , and kings that were to be , were not yet of the teacher class , and no ruined nobility had dropped out of tellson's ledgers , to turn cooks and carpenters .
as a tutor , whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable , and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge , young mr. darnay soon became known and encouraged .
he was well acquainted , moreover , with the circumstances of his country , and those were of evergrowing interest .
so , with great perseverance and untiring industry , he prospered .
in london , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses ; if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered .
he had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it .
in this , his prosperity consisted .
a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge , where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in european languages , instead of conveying greek and latin through the customhouse .
the rest of his time he passed in london .
now , from the days when it was always summer in eden , to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes , the world of a man has invariably gone one waycharles darnay's waythe way of the love of a woman .
he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger .
he had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice ; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful , as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him .
but , he had not yet spoken to her on the subject ; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long , long , dusty roadsthe solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dreamhad been done a year , and he had never yet , by so much as a single spoken word , disclosed to her the state of his heart .
that he had his reasons for this , he knew full well .
it was again a summer day when , lately arrived in london from his college occupation , he turned into the quiet corner in soho , bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to doctor manette .
it was the close of the summer day , and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross .
he found the doctor reading in his armchair at a window .
the energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness , had been gradually restored to him .
he was now a very energetic man indeed , with great firmness of purpose , strength of resolution , and vigour of action .
in his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden , as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties ; but , this had never been frequently observable , and had grown more and more rare .
he studied much , slept little , sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease , and was equably cheerful .
to him , now entered charles darnay , at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand .
charles darnay !
i rejoice to see you .
we have been counting on your return these three or four days past .
mr. stryver and sydney carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due .
i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , he answered , a little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the doctor .
miss manette is well , said the doctor , as he stopped short , and your return will delight us all .
she has gone out on some household matters , but will soon be home .
doctor manette , i knew she was from home .
i took the opportunity of her being from home , to beg to speak to you .
there was a blank silence .
yes ?
said the doctor , with evident constraint .
bring your chair here , and speak on .
he complied as to the chair , but appeared to find the speaking on less easy .
i have had the happiness , doctor manette , of being so intimate here , so he at length began , for some year and a half , that i hope the topic on which i am about to touch may not he was stayed by the doctor's putting out his hand to stop him .
when he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : is lucie the topic ?
she is .
it is hard for me to speak of her at any time .
it is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , charles darnay .
it is a tone of fervent admiration , true homage , and deep love , doctor manette !
he said deferentially .
there was another blank silence before her father rejoined : i believe it .
i do you justice ; i believe it .
his constraint was so manifest , and it was so manifest , too , that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject , that charles darnay hesitated .
shall i go on , sir ?
another blank .
yes , go on .
you anticipate what i would say , though you cannot know how earnestly i say it , how earnestly i feel it , without knowing my secret heart , and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden .
dear doctor manette , i love your daughter fondly , dearly , disinterestedly , devotedly .
if ever there were love in the world , i love her .
you have loved yourself ; let your old love speak for me !
the doctor sat with his face turned away , and his eyes bent on the ground .
at the last words , he stretched out his hand again , hurriedly , and cried : not that , sir !
let that be !
i adjure you , do not recall that !
his cry was so like a cry of actual pain , that it rang in charles darnay's ears long after he had ceased .
he motioned with the hand he had extended , and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause .
the latter so received it , and remained silent .
i ask your pardon , said the doctor , in a subdued tone , after some moments .
i do not doubt your loving lucie ; you may be satisfied of it .
he turned towards him in his chair , but did not look at him , or raise his eyes .
his chin dropped upon his hand , and his white hair overshadowed his face : have you spoken to lucie ?
no .
nor written ?
never .
it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your selfdenial is to be referred to your consideration for her father .
her father thanks you .
he offered his hand ; but his eyes did not go with it .
i know , said darnay , respectfully , how can i fail to know , doctor manette , i who have seen you together from day to day , that between you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual , so touching , so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured , that it can have few parallels , even in the tenderness between a father and child .
i know , doctor manettehow can i fail to knowthat , mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman , there is , in her heart , towards you , all the love and reliance of infancy itself .
i know that , as in her childhood she had no parent , so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character , united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her .
i know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life , you could hardly be invested , in her sight , with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her .
i know that when she is clinging to you , the hands of baby , girl , and woman , all in one , are round your neck .
i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age , sees and loves you at my age , loves her mother brokenhearted , loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration .
i have known this , night and day , since i have known you in your home .
her father sat silent , with his face bent down .
his breathing was a little quickened ; but he repressed all other signs of agitation .
dear doctor manette , always knowing this , always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you , i have forborne , and forborne , as long as it was in the nature of man to do it .
i have felt , and do even now feel , that to bring my loveeven minebetween you , is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself .
but i love her .
heaven is my witness that i love her !
i believe it , answered her father , mournfully .
i have thought so before now .
i believe it .
but , do not believe , said darnay , upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound , that if my fortune were so cast as that , being one day so happy as to make her my wife , i must at any time put any separation between her and you , i could or would breathe a word of what i now say .
besides that i should know it to be hopeless , i should know it to be a baseness .
if i had any such possibility , even at a remote distance of years , harboured in my thoughts , and hidden in my heartif it ever had been thereif it ever could be therei could not now touch this honoured hand .
he laid his own upon it as he spoke .
no , dear doctor manette .
like you , a voluntary exile from france ; like you , driven from it by its distractions , oppressions , and miseries ; like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and trusting in a happier future ; i look only to sharing your fortunes , sharing your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death .
not to divide with lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend ; but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be .
his touch still lingered on her father's hand .
answering the touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference .
a struggle was evidently in his face ; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread .
you speak so feelingly and so manfully , charles darnay , that i thank you with all my heart , and will open all my heartor nearly so .
have you any reason to believe that lucie loves you ?
none .
as yet , none .
is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge ?
not even so .
i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks ; i might mistaken or not mistaken have that hopefulness tomorrow .
do you seek any guidance from me ?
i ask none , sir .
but i have thought it possible that you might have it in your power , if you should deem it right , to give me some .
do you seek any promise from me ?
i do seek that .
what is it ?
i well understand that , without you , i could have no hope .
i well understand that , even if miss manette held me at this moment in her innocent heartdo not think i have the presumption to assume so muchi could retain no place in it against her love for her father .
if that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it ?
i understand equally well , that a word from her father in any suitor's favour , would outweigh herself and all the world .
for which reason , doctor manette , said darnay , modestly but firmly , i would not ask that word , to save my life .
i am sure of it .
charles darnay , mysteries arise out of close love , as well as out of wide division ; in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate .
my daughter lucie is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me ; i can make no guess at the state of her heart .
may i ask , sir , if you think she is as he hesitated , her father supplied the rest .
is sought by any other suitor ?
it is what i meant to say .
her father considered a little before he answered : you have seen mr. carton here , yourself .
mr. stryver is here too , occasionally .
if it be at all , it can only be by one of these .
or both , said darnay .
i had not thought of both ; i should not think either , likely .
you want a promise from me .
tell me what it is .
it is , that if miss manette should bring to you at any time , on her own part , such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you , you will bear testimony to what i have said , and to your belief in it .
i hope you may be able to think so well of me , as to urge no influence against me .
i say nothing more of my stake in this ; this is what i ask .
the condition on which i ask it , and which you have an undoubted right to require , i will observe immediately .
i give the promise , said the doctor , without any condition .
i believe your object to be , purely and truthfully , as you have stated it .
i believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self .
if she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , i will give her to you .
if there werecharles darnay , if there were the young man had taken his hand gratefully ; their hands were joined as the doctor spoke : any fancies , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against the man she really lovedthe direct responsibility thereof not lying on his headthey should all be obliterated for her sake .
she is everything to me ; more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to mewell !
this is idle talk .
so strange was the way in which he faded into silence , and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak , that darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it .
you said something to me , said doctor manette , breaking into a smile .
what was it you said to me ?
he was at a loss how to answer , until he remembered having spoken of a condition .
relieved as his mind reverted to that , he answered : your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part .
my present name , though but slightly changed from my mother's , is not , as you will remember , my own .
i wish to tell you what that is , and why i am in england .
stop !
said the doctor of beauvais .
i wish it , that i may the better deserve your confidence , and have no secret from you .
stop !
for an instant , the doctor even had his two hands at his ears ; for another instant , even had his two hands laid on darnay's lips .
tell me when i ask you , not now .
if your suit should prosper , if lucie should love you , you shall tell me on your marriage morning .
do you promise ?
willingly .
give me your hand .
she will be home directly , and it is better she should not see us together tonight .
go !
god bless you !
it was dark when charles darnay left him , and it was an hour later and darker when lucie came home ; she hurried into the room alonefor miss pross had gone straight upstairsand was surprised to find his readingchair empty .
my father !
she called to him .
father dear !
nothing was said in answer , but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom .
passing lightly across the intermediate room , she looked in at his door and came running back frightened , crying to herself , with her blood all chilled , what shall i do !
what shall i do !
her uncertainty lasted but a moment ; she hurried back , and tapped at his door , and softly called to him .
the noise ceased at the sound of her voice , and he presently came out to her , and they walked up and down together for a long time .
she came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night .
he slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual .
sydney , said mr. stryver , on that selfsame night , or morning , to his jackal ; mix another bowl of punch ; i have something to say to you .
sydney had been working double tides that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in succession , making a grand clearance among mr. stryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation .
the clearance was effected at last ; the stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up ; everything was got rid of until november should come with its fogs atmospheric , and fogs legal , and bring grist to the mill again .
sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application .
it had taken a deal of extra wettowelling to pull him through the night ; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling ; and he was in a very damaged condition , as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours .
are you mixing that other bowl of punch ?
said stryver the portly , with his hands in his waistband , glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back .
i am .
now , look here !
i am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you , and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me .
i intend to marry .
do you ?
yes .
and not for money .
what do you say now ?
i don't feel disposed to say much .
who is she ?
guess .
do i know her ?
guess .
i am not going to guess , at five o'clock in the morning , with my brains frying and sputtering in my head .
if you want me to guess , you must ask me to dinner .
well then , i'll tell you , said stryver , coming slowly into a sitting posture .
sydney , i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you , because you are such an insensible dog .
and you , returned sydney , busy concocting the punch , are such a sensitive and poetical spirit come !
rejoined stryver , laughing boastfully , though i don't prefer any claim to being the soul of romance for i hope i know better , still i am a tenderer sort of fellow than you .
you are a luckier , if you mean that .
i don't mean that .
i mean i am a man of moremore say gallantry , while you are about it , suggested carton .
well !
i'll say gallantry .
my meaning is that i am a man , said stryver , inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch , who cares more to be agreeable , who takes more pains to be agreeable , who knows better how to be agreeable , in a woman's society , than you do .
go on , said sydney carton .
no ; but before i go on , said stryver , shaking his head in his bullying way , i'll have this out with you .
you've been at doctor manette's house as much as i have , or more than i have .
why , i have been ashamed of your moroseness there !
your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind , that , upon my life and soul , i have been ashamed of you , sydney !
it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar , to be ashamed of anything , returned sydney ; you ought to be much obliged to me .
you shall not get off in that way , rejoined stryver , shouldering the rejoinder at him ; no , sydney , it's my duty to tell youand i tell you to your face to do you goodthat you are a devilish illconditioned fellow in that sort of society .
you are a disagreeable fellow .
sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made , and laughed .
look at me !
said stryver , squaring himself ; i have less need to make myself agreeable than you have , being more independent in circumstances .
why do i do it ?
i never saw you do it yet , muttered carton .
i do it because it's politic ; i do it on principle .
and look at me !
i get on .
you don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , answered carton , with a careless air ; i wish you would keep to that .
as to mewill you never understand that i am incorrigible ?
he asked the question with some appearance of scorn .
you have no business to be incorrigible , was his friend's answer , delivered in no very soothing tone .
i have no business to be , at all , that i know of , said sydney carton .
who is the lady ?
now , don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable , sydney , said mr. stryver , preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make , because i know you don't mean half you say ; and if you meant it all , it would be of no importance .
i make this little preface , because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms .
i did ?
certainly ; and in these chambers .
sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend ; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
you made mention of the young lady as a goldenhaired doll .
the young lady is miss manette .
if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way , sydney , i might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation ; but you are not .
you want that sense altogether ; therefore i am no more annoyed when i think of the expression , than i should be annoyed by a man's opinion of a picture of mine , who had no eye for pictures : or of a piece of music of mine , who had no ear for music .
sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate ; drank it by bumpers , looking at his friend .
now you know all about it , syd , said mr. stryver .
i don't care about fortune : she is a charming creature , and i have made up my mind to please myself : on the whole , i think i can afford to please myself .
she will have in me a man already pretty well off , and a rapidly rising man , and a man of some distinction : it is a piece of good fortune for her , but she is worthy of good fortune .
are you astonished ?
carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , why should i be astonished ?
you approve ?
carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , why should i not approve ?
well !
said his friend stryver , you take it more easily than i fancied you would , and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would be ; though , to be sure , you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will .
yes , sydney , i have had enough of this style of life , with no other as a change from it ; i feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it when he doesn't , he can stay away , and i feel that miss manette will tell well in any station , and will always do me credit .
so i have made up my mind .
and now , sydney , old boy , i want to say a word to you about your prospects .
you are in a bad way , you know ; you really are in a bad way .
you don't know the value of money , you live hard , you'll knock up one of these days , and be ill and poor ; you really ought to think about a nurse .
the prosperous patronage with which he said it , made him look twice as big as he was , and four times as offensive .
now , let me recommend you , pursued stryver , to look it in the face .
i have looked it in the face , in my different way ; look it in the face , you , in your different way .
marry .
provide somebody to take care of you .
never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society , nor understanding of it , nor tact for it .
find out somebody .
find out some respectable woman with a little propertysomebody in the landlady way , or lodgingletting wayand marry her , against a rainy day .
that's the kind of thing for you .
now think of it , sydney .
i'll think of it , said sydney .
mr. stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the doctor's daughter , resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the long vacation .
after some mental debating of the point , he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with , and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before michaelmas term , or in the little christmas vacation between it and hilary .
as to the strength of his case , he had not a doubt about it , but clearly saw his way to the verdict .
argued with the jury on substantial worldly groundsthe only grounds ever worth taking into accountit was a plain case , and had not a weak spot in it .
he called himself for the plaintiff , there was no getting over his evidence , the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief , and the jury did not even turn to consider .
after trying it , stryver , c .
j .
 ,was satisfied that no plainer case could be .
accordingly , mr. stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens ; that failing , to ranelagh ; that unaccountably failing too , it behoved him to present himself in soho , and there declare his noble mind .
towards soho , therefore , mr. stryver shouldered his way from the temple , while the bloom of the long vacation's infancy was still upon it .
anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet on saint dunstan's side of temple bar , bursting in his fullblown way along the pavement , to the jostlement of all weaker people , might have seen how safe and strong he was .
his way taking him past tellson's , and he both banking at tellson's and knowing mr. lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes , it entered mr. stryver's mind to enter the bank , and reveal to mr. lorry the brightness of the soho horizon .
so , he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat , stumbled down the two steps , got past the two ancient cashiers , and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr. lorry sat at great books ruled for figures , with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too , and everything under the clouds were a sum .
halloa !
said mr. stryver .
how do you do ?
i hope you are well !
it was stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place , or space .
he was so much too big for tellson's , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall .
the house itself , magnificently reading the paper quite in the faroff perspective , lowered displeased , as if the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat .
the discreet mr. lorry said , in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances , how do you do , mr. stryver ?
how do you do , sir ?
and shook hands .
there was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands , always to be seen in any clerk at tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air .
he shook in a selfabnegating way , as one who shook for tellson and co .
can i do anything for you , mr. stryver ?
asked mr. lorry , in his business character .
why , no , thank you ; this is a private visit to yourself , mr. lorry ; i have come for a private word .
oh indeed !
said mr. lorry , bending down his ear , while his eye strayed to the house afar off .
i am going , said mr. stryver , leaning his arms confidentially on the desk : whereupon , although it was a large double one , there appeared to be not half desk enough for him : i am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend , miss manette , mr. lorry .
oh dear me !
cried mr. lorry , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor dubiously .
oh dear me , sir ?
repeated stryver , drawing back .
oh dear you , sir ?
what may your meaning be , mr. lorry ?
my meaning , answered the man of business , is , of course , friendly and appreciative , and that it does you the greatest credit , andin short , my meaning is everything you could desire .
butreally , you know , mr. stryver mr. lorry paused , and shook his head at him in the oddest manner , as if he were compelled against his will to add , internally , you know there really is so much too much of you !
well !
said stryver , slapping the desk with his contentious hand , opening his eyes wider , and taking a long breath , if i understand you , mr. lorry , i'll be hanged !
mr. lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the feather of a pen .
dn it all , sir !
said stryver , staring at him , am i not eligible ?
oh dear yes !
yes .
oh yes , you're eligible !
said mr. lorry .
if you say eligible , you are eligible .
am i not prosperous ?
asked stryver .
oh !
if you come to prosperous , you are prosperous , said mr. lorry .
and advancing ?
if you come to advancing you know , said mr. lorry , delighted to be able to make another admission , nobody can doubt that .
then what on earth is your meaning , mr. lorry ?
demanded stryver , perceptibly crestfallen .
well !
iwere you going there now ?
asked mr. lorry .
straight !
said stryver , with a plump of his fist on the desk .
then i think i wouldn't , if i was you .
why ?
said stryver .
now , i'll put you in a corner , forensically shaking a forefinger at him .
you are a man of business and bound to have a reason .
state your reason .
why wouldn't you go ?
because , said mr. lorry , i wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that i should succeed .
dn me !
cried stryver , but this beats everything .
mr. lorry glanced at the distant house , and glanced at the angry stryver .
here's a man of businessa man of yearsa man of experiencein a bank , said stryver ; and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success , he says there's no reason at all !
says it with his head on !
mr. stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off .
when i speak of success , i speak of success with the young lady ; and when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable , i speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady .
the young lady , my good sir , said mr. lorry , mildly tapping the stryver arm , the young lady .
the young lady goes before all .
then you mean to tell me , mr. lorry , said stryver , squaring his elbows , that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing fool ?
not exactly so .
i mean to tell you , mr. stryver , said mr. lorry , reddening , that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips ; and that if i knew any manwhich i hope i do notwhose taste was so coarse , and whose temper was so overbearing , that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk , not even tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind .
the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr. stryver's bloodvessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry ; mr. lorry's veins , methodical as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn .
that is what i mean to tell you , sir , said mr. lorry .
pray let there be no mistake about it .
mr. stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while , and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him the toothache .
he broke the awkward silence by saying : this is something new to me , mr. lorry .
you deliberately advise me not to go up to soho and offer myselfmyself , stryver of the king's bench bar ?
do you ask me for my advice , mr. stryver ?
yes , i do .
very good .
then i give it , and you have repeated it correctly .
and all i can say of it is , laughed stryver with a vexed laugh , that thisha , ha !
beatseverything past , present , and to come .
now understand me , pursued mr. lorry .
as a man of business , i am not justified in saying anything about this matter , for , as a man of business , i know nothing of it .
but , as an old fellow , who has carried miss manette in his arms , who is the trusted friend of miss manette and of her father too , and who has a great affection for them both , i have spoken .
the confidence is not of my seeking , recollect .
now , you think i may not be right ?
not i !
said stryver , whistling .
i can't undertake to find third parties in common sense ; i can only find it for myself .
i suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose mincing breadandbutter nonsense .
it's new to me , but you are right , i dare say .
what i suppose , mr. stryver , i claim to characterise for myselfand understand me , sir , said mr. lorry , quickly flushing again , i will notnot even at tellson'shave it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing .
there !
i beg your pardon !
said stryver .
granted .
thank you .
well , mr. stryver , i was about to say :it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken , it might be painful to doctor manette to have the task of being explicit with you , it might be very painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you .
you know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with the family .
if you please , committing you in no way , representing you in no way , i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it .
if you should then be dissatisfied with it , you can but test its soundness for yourself ; if , on the other hand , you should be satisfied with it , and it should be what it now is , it may spare all sides what is best spared .
what do you say ?
how long would you keep me in town ?
oh !
it is only a question of a few hours .
i could go to soho in the evening , and come to your chambers afterwards .
then i say yes , said stryver : i won't go up there now , i am not so hot upon it as that comes to ; i say yes , and i shall expect you to look in tonight .
good morning .
then mr. stryver turned and burst out of the bank , causing such a concussion of air on his passage through , that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters , required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks .
those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing , and were popularly believed , when they had bowed a customer out , still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in .
the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty .
unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow , he got it down .
and now , said mr. stryver , shaking his forensic forefinger at the temple in general , when it was down , my way out of this , is , to put you all in the wrong .
it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician , in which he found great relief .
you shall not put me in the wrong , young lady , said mr. stryver ; i'll do that for you .
accordingly , when mr. lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock , mr. stryver , among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose , seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning .
he even showed surprise when he saw mr. lorry , and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state .
well !
said that goodnatured emissary , after a full halfhour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question .
i have been to soho .
to soho ?
repeated mr. stryver , coldly .
oh , to be sure !
what am i thinking of !
and i have no doubt , said mr. lorry , that i was right in the conversation we had .
my opinion is confirmed , and i reiterate my advice .
i assure you , returned mr. stryver , in the friendliest way , that i am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on the poor father's account .
i know this must always be a sore subject with the family ; let us say no more about it .
i don't understand you , said mr. lorry .
i dare say not , rejoined stryver , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way ; no matter , no matter .
but it does matter , mr. lorry urged .
no it doesn't ; i assure you it doesn't .
having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense , and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition , i am well out of my mistake , and no harm is done .
young women have committed similar follies often before , and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before .
in an unselfish aspect , i am sorry that the thing is dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view ; in a selfish aspect , i am glad that the thing has dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of viewit is hardly necessary to say i could have gained nothing by it .
there is no harm at all done .
i have not proposed to the young lady , and , between ourselves , i am by no means certain , on reflection , that i ever should have committed myself to that extent .
mr. lorry , you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of emptyheaded girls ; you must not expect to do it , or you will always be disappointed .
now , pray say no more about it .
i tell you , i regret it on account of others , but i am satisfied on my own account .
and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you , and for giving me your advice ; you know the young lady better than i do ; you were right , it never would have done .
mr. lorry was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at mr. stryver shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head .
make the best of it , my dear sir , said stryver ; say no more about it ; thank you again for allowing me to sound you ; good night !
mr. lorry was out in the night , before he knew where he was .
mr. stryver was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling .
if sydney carton ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of doctor manette .
he had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
when he cared to talk , he talked well ; but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him .
and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house , and for the senseless stones that made their pavements .
many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and unattainable , into his mind .
of late , the neglected bed in the temple court had known him more scantily than ever ; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes , he had got up again , and haunted that neighbourhood .
on a day in august , when mr. stryver after notifying to his jackal that he had thought better of that marrying matter had carried his delicacy into devonshire , and when the sight and scent of flowers in the city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst , of health for the sickliest , and of youth for the oldest , sydney's feet still trod those stones .
from being irresolute and purposeless , his feet became animated by an intention , and , in the working out of that intention , they took him to the doctor's door .
he was shown upstairs , and found lucie at her work , alone .
she had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
but , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few commonplaces , she observed a change in it .
i fear you are not well , mr. carton !
no .
but the life i lead , miss manette , is not conducive to health .
what is to be expected of , or by , such profligates ?
is it notforgive me ; i have begun the question on my lipsa pity to live no better life ?
god knows it is a shame !
then why not change it ?
looking gently at him again , she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes .
there were tears in his voice too , as he answered : it is too late for that .
i shall never be better than i am .
i shall sink lower , and be worse .
he leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
the table trembled in the silence that followed .
she had never seen him softened , and was much distressed .
he knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : pray forgive me , miss manette .
i break down before the knowledge of what i want to say to you .
will you hear me ?
if it will do you any good , mr. carton , if it would make you happier , it would make me very glad !
god bless you for your sweet compassion !
he unshaded his face after a little while , and spoke steadily .
don't be afraid to hear me .
don't shrink from anything i say .
i am like one who died young .
all my life might have been .
no , mr. carton .
i am sure that the best part of it might still be ; i am sure that you might be much , much worthier of yourself .
say of you , miss manette , and although i know betteralthough in the mystery of my own wretched heart i know betteri shall never forget it !
she was pale and trembling .
he came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden .
if it had been possible , miss manette , that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourselfflung away , wasted , drunken , poor creature of misuse as you know him to behe would have been conscious this day and hour , in spite of his happiness , that he would bring you to misery , bring you to sorrow and repentance , blight you , disgrace you , pull you down with him .
i know very well that you can have no tenderness for me ; i ask for none ; i am even thankful that it cannot be .
without it , can i not save you , mr. carton ?
can i not recall youforgive me again !
toa better course ?
can i in no way repay your confidence ?
i know this is a confidence , she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , i know you would say this to no one else .
can i turn it to no good account for yourself , mr. carton ?
he shook his head .
to none .
no , miss manette , to none .
if you will hear me through a very little more , all you can ever do for me is done .
i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul .
in my degradation i have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father , and of this home made such a home by you , has stirred old shadows that i thought had died out of me .
since i knew you , i have been troubled by a remorse that i thought would never reproach me again , and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward , that i thought were silent for ever .
i have had unformed ideas of striving afresh , beginning anew , shaking off sloth and sensuality , and fighting out the abandoned fight .
a dream , all a dream , that ends in nothing , and leaves the sleeper where he lay down , but i wish you to know that you inspired it .
will nothing of it remain ?
o mr. carton , think again !
try again !
no , miss manette ; all through it , i have known myself to be quite undeserving .
and yet i have had the weakness , and have still the weakness , to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me , heap of ashes that i am , into firea fire , however , inseparable in its nature from myself , quickening nothing , lighting nothing , doing no service , idly burning away .
since it is my misfortune , mr. carton , to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me don't say that , miss manette , for you would have reclaimed me , if anything could .
you will not be the cause of my becoming worse .
since the state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , attributable to some influence of minethis is what i mean , if i can make it plaincan i use no influence to serve you ?
have i no power for good , with you , at all ?
the utmost good that i am capable of now , miss manette , i have come here to realise .
let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life , the remembrance that i opened my heart to you , last of all the world ; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity .
which i entreated you to believe , again and again , most fervently , with all my heart , was capable of better things , mr. carton !
entreat me to believe it no more , miss manette .
i have proved myself , and i know better .
i distress you ; i draw fast to an end .
will you let me believe , when i recall this day , that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast , and that it lies there alone , and will be shared by no one ?
if that will be a consolation to you , yes .
not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you ?
mr .
carton , she answered , after an agitated pause , the secret is yours , not mine ; and i promise to respect it .
thank you .
and again , god bless you .
he put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door .
be under no apprehension , miss manette , of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word .
i will never refer to it again .
if i were dead , that could not be surer than it is henceforth .
in the hour of my death , i shall hold sacred the one good remembranceand shall thank and bless you for itthat my last avowal of myself was made to you , and that my name , and faults , and miseries were gently carried in your heart .
may it otherwise be light and happy !
he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be , and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away , and how much he every day kept down and perverted , that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her .
be comforted !
he said , i am not worth such feeling , miss manette .
an hour or two hence , and the low companions and low habits that i scorn but yield to , will render me less worth such tears as those , than any wretch who creeps along the streets .
be comforted !
but , within myself , i shall always be , towards you , what i am now , though outwardly i shall be what you have heretofore seen me .
the last supplication but one i make to you , is , that you will believe this of me .
i will , mr. carton .
my last supplication of all , is this ; and with it , i will relieve you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison , and between whom and you there is an impassable space .
it is useless to say it , i know , but it rises out of my soul .
for you , and for any dear to you , i would do anything .
if my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it , i would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you .
try to hold me in your mind , at some quiet times , as ardent and sincere in this one thing .
the time will come , the time will not be long in coming , when new ties will be formed about youties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adornthe dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you .
o miss manette , when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours , when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet , think now and then that there is a man who would give his life , to keep a life you love beside you !
he said , farewell !
said a last god bless you !
and left her .
to the eyes of mr. jeremiah cruncher , sitting on his stool in fleetstreet with his grisly urchin beside him , a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented .
who could sit upon anything in fleetstreet during the busy hours of the day , and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions , one ever tending westward with the sun , the other ever tending eastward from the sun , both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down !
with his straw in his mouth , mr. cruncher sat watching the two streams , like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one streamsaving that jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry .
nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind , since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life from tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore .
brief as such companionship was in every separate instance , mr. cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health .
and it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose , that he recruited his finances , as just now observed .
time was , when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place , and mused in the sight of men .
mr. cruncher , sitting on a stool in a public place , but not being a poet , mused as little as possible , and looked about him .
it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few , and belated women few , and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs. cruncher must have been flopping in some pointed manner , when an unusual concourse pouring down fleetstreet westward , attracted his attention .
looking that way , mr. cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along , and that there was popular objection to this funeral , which engendered uproar .
young jerry , said mr. cruncher , turning to his offspring , it's a buryin' .
hooroar , father !
cried young jerry .
the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance .
the elder gentleman took the cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and smote the young gentleman on the ear .
what d'ye mean ?
what are you hooroaring at ?
what do you want to conwey to your own father , you young rip ?
this boy is a getting too many for me !
said mr. cruncher , surveying him .
him and his hooroars !
don't let me hear no more of you , or you shall feel some more of me .
d'ye hear ?
i warn't doing no harm , young jerry protested , rubbing his cheek .
drop it then , said mr. cruncher ; i won't have none of your no harms .
get a top of that there seat , and look at the crowd .
his son obeyed , and the crowd approached ; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach , in which mourning coach there was only one mourner , dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position .
the position appeared by no means to please him , however , with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach , deriding him , making grimaces at him , and incessantly groaning and calling out : yah !
spies !
tst !
yaha !
spies !
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat .
funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr. cruncher ; he always pricked up his senses , and became excited , when a funeral passed tellson's .
naturally , therefore , a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly , and he asked of the first man who ran against him : what is it , brother ?
what's it about ?
i don't know , said the man .
spies !
yaha !
tst !
spies !
he asked another man .
who is it ?
i don't know , returned the man , clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless , and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour , spies !
yaha !
tst , tst !
spiies !
at length , a person better informed on the merits of the case , tumbled against him , and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one roger cly .
was he a spy ?
asked mr. cruncher .
old bailey spy , returned his informant .
yaha !
tst !
yah !
old bailey spiiies !
why , to be sure !
exclaimed jerry , recalling the trial at which he had assisted .
i've seen him .
dead , is he ?
dead as mutton , returned the other , and can't be too dead .
have 'em out , there !
spies !
pull 'em out , there !
spies !
the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea , that the crowd caught it up with eagerness , and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out , and to pull 'em out , mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop .
on the crowd's opening the coach doors , the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment ; but he was so alert , and made such good use of his time , that in another moment he was scouring away up a byestreet , after shedding his cloak , hat , long hatband , white pockethandkerchief , and other symbolical tears .
these , the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment , while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops ; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing , and was a monster much dreaded .
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing .
practical suggestions being much needed , this suggestion , too , was received with acclamation , and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out , while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it .
among the first of these volunteers was jerry cruncher himself , who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of tellson's , in the further corner of the mourning coach .
the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies ; but , the river being alarmingly near , and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason , the protest was faint and brief .
the remodelled procession started , with a chimneysweep driving the hearseadvised by the regular driver , who was perched beside him , under close inspection , for the purposeand with a pieman , also attended by his cabinet minister , driving the mourning coach .
a bearleader , a popular street character of the time , was impressed as an additional ornament , before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand ; and his bear , who was black and very mangy , gave quite an undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked .
thus , with beerdrinking , pipesmoking , songroaring , and infinite caricaturing of woe , the disorderly procession went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it .
its destination was the old church of saint pancras , far off in the fields .
it got there in course of time ; insisted on pouring into the burialground ; finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction .
the dead man disposed of , and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself , another brighter genius or perhaps the same conceived the humour of impeaching casual passersby , as old bailey spies , and wreaking vengeance on them .
chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the old bailey in their lives , in the realisation of this fancy , and they were roughly hustled and maltreated .
the transition to the sport of windowbreaking , and thence to the plundering of publichouses , was easy and natural .
at last , after several hours , when sundry summerhouses had been pulled down , and some arearailings had been torn up , to arm the more belligerent spirits , a rumour got about that the guards were coming .
before this rumour , the crowd gradually melted away , and perhaps the guards came , and perhaps they never came , and this was the usual progress of a mob .
mr. cruncher did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to confer and condole with the undertakers .
the place had a soothing influence on him .
he procured a pipe from a neighbouring publichouse , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot .
jerry , said mr. cruncher , apostrophising himself in his usual way , you see that there cly that day , and you see with your own eyes that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un .
having smoked his pipe out , and ruminated a little longer , he turned himself about , that he might appear , before the hour of closing , on his station at tellson's .
whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver , or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss , or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man , is not so much to the purpose , as that he made a short call upon his medical advisera distinguished surgeonon his way back .
young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported no job in his absence .
the bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and mr. cruncher and his son went home to tea .
now , i tell you where it is !
said mr. cruncher to his wife , on entering .
if , as a honest tradesman , my wenturs goes wrong tonight , i shall make sure that you've been praying again me , and i shall work you for it just the same as if i seen you do it .
the dejected mrs. cruncher shook her head .
why , you're at it afore my face !
said mr. cruncher , with signs of angry apprehension .
i am saying nothing .
well , then ; don't meditate nothing .
you might as well flop as meditate .
you may as well go again me one way as another .
drop it altogether .
yes , jerry .
yes , jerry , repeated mr. cruncher sitting down to tea .
ah !
it is yes , jerry .
that's about it .
you may say yes , jerry .
mr. cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations , but made use of them , as people not unfrequently do , to express general ironical dissatisfaction .
you and your yes , jerry , said mr. cruncher , taking a bite out of his breadandbutter , and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer .
ah !
i think so .
i believe you .
you are going out tonight ?
asked his decent wife , when he took another bite .
yes , i am .
may i go with you , father ?
asked his son , briskly .
no , you mayn't .
i'm a goingas your mother knowsa fishing .
that's where i'm going to .
going a fishing .
your fishingrod gets rayther rusty ; don't it , father ?
never you mind .
shall you bring any fish home , father ?
if i don't , you'll have short commons , tomorrow , returned that gentleman , shaking his head ; that's questions enough for you ; i ain't a going out , till you've been long abed .
he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on mrs. cruncher , and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage .
with this view , he urged his son to hold her in conversation also , and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her , rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections .
the devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife .
it was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story .
and mind you !
said mr. cruncher .
no games tomorrow !
if i , as a honest tradesman , succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two , none of your not touching of it , and sticking to bread .
if i , as a honest tradesman , am able to provide a little beer , none of your declaring on water .
when you go to rome , do as rome does .
rome will be a ugly customer to you , if you don't .
i'm your rome , you know .
then he began grumbling again : with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink !
i don't know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here , by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct .
look at your boy : he is your'n , ain't he ?
he's as thin as a lath .
do you call yourself a mother , and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out ?
this touched young jerry on a tender place ; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty , and , whatever else she did or neglected , above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent .
thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family , until young jerry was ordered to bed , and his mother , laid under similar injunctions , obeyed them .
mr. cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes , and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock .
towards that small and ghostly hour , he rose up from his chair , took a key out of his pocket , opened a locked cupboard , and brought forth a sack , a crowbar of convenient size , a rope and chain , and other fishing tackle of that nature .
disposing these articles about him in skilful manner , he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs. cruncher , extinguished the light , and went out .
young jerry , who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed , was not long after his father .
under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room , followed down the stairs , followed down the court , followed out into the streets .
he was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again , for it was full of lodgers , and the door stood ajar all night .
impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father's honest calling , young jerry , keeping as close to house fronts , walls , and doorways , as his eyes were close to one another , held his honoured parent in view .
the honoured parent steering northward , had not gone far , when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton , and the two trudged on together .
within half an hour from the first starting , they were beyond the winking lamps , and the more than winking watchmen , and were out upon a lonely road .
another fisherman was picked up hereand that so silently , that if young jerry had been superstitious , he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have , all of a sudden , split himself into two .
the three went on , and young jerry went on , until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road .
upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall , surmounted by an iron railing .
in the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road , and up a blind lane , of which the wallthere , risen to some eight or ten feet highformed one side .
crouching down in a corner , peeping up the lane , the next object that young jerry saw , was the form of his honoured parent , pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon , nimbly scaling an iron gate .
he was soon over , and then the second fisherman got over , and then the third .
they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a littlelistening perhaps .
then , they moved away on their hands and knees .
it was now young jerry's turn to approach the gate : which he did , holding his breath .
crouching down again in a corner there , and looking in , he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass !
and all the gravestones in the churchyardit was a large churchyard that they were inlooking on like ghosts in white , while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant .
they did not creep far , before they stopped and stood upright .
and then they began to fish .
they fished with a spade , at first .
presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew .
whatever tools they worked with , they worked hard , until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry , that he made off , with his hair as stiff as his father's .
but , his longcherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again .
they were still fishing perseveringly , when he peeped in at the gate for the second time ; but , now they seemed to have got a bite .
there was a screwing and complaining sound down below , and their bent figures were strained , as if by a weight .
by slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it , and came to the surface .
young jerry very well knew what it would be ; but , when he saw it , and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open , he was so frightened , being new to the sight , that he made off again , and never stopped until he had run a mile or more .
he would not have stopped then , for anything less necessary than breath , it being a spectral sort of race that he ran , and one highly desirable to get to the end of .
he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him ; and , pictured as hopping on behind him , bolt upright , upon its narrow end , always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his sideperhaps taking his armit was a pursuer to shun .
it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too , for , while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful , he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys , fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings .
it hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing .
it got into shadows on the road , and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up .
all this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him , so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead .
and even then it would not leave him , but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair , scrambled into bed with him , and bumped down , dead and heavy , on his breast when he fell asleep .
from his oppressed slumber , young jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise , by the presence of his father in the family room .
something had gone wrong with him ; at least , so young jerry inferred , from the circumstance of his holding mrs. cruncher by the ears , and knocking the back of her head against the headboard of the bed .
i told you i would , said mr. cruncher , and i did .
jerry , jerry , jerry !
his wife implored .
you oppose yourself to the profit of the business , said jerry , and me and my partners suffer .
you was to honour and obey ; why the devil don't you ?
i try to be a good wife , jerry , the poor woman protested , with tears .
is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business ?
is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business ?
is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business ?
you hadn't taken to the dreadful business then , jerry .
it's enough for you , retorted mr. cruncher , to be the wife of a honest tradesman , and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn't .
a honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether .
call yourself a religious woman ?
if you're a religious woman , give me a irreligious one !
you have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has of a pile , and similarly it must be knocked into you .
the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his claysoiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor .
after taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again .
there was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else .
mr. cruncher was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron potlid by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs. cruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace .
he was brushed and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling .
young jerry , walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded fleetstreet , was a very different young jerry from him of the previous night , running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer .
his cunning was fresh with the day , and his qualms were gone with the nightin which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in fleetstreet and the city of london , that fine morning .
father , said young jerry , as they walked along : taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them : what's a resurrectionman ?
mr. cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered , how should i know ?
i thought you knowed everything , father , said the artless boy .
hem !
well , returned mr. cruncher , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , he's a tradesman .
what's his goods , father ?
asked the brisk young jerry .
his goods , said mr. cruncher , after turning it over in his mind , is a branch of scientific goods .
persons' bodies , ain't it , father ?
asked the lively boy .
i believe it is something of that sort , said mr. cruncher .
oh , father , i should so like to be a resurrectionman when i'm quite growed up !
mr. cruncher was soothed , but shook his head in a dubious and moral way .
it depends upon how you dewelop your talents .
be careful to dewelop your talents , and never to say no more than you can help to nobody , and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for .
as young jerry , thus encouraged , went on a few yards in advance , to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar , mr. cruncher added to himself : jerry , you honest tradesman , there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you , and a recompense to you for his mother !
there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wineshop of monsieur defarge .
as early as six o'clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over measures of wine .
monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time .
a sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy .
no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur defarge : but , a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the dregs of it .
this had been the third morning in succession , on which there had been early drinking at the wineshop of monsieur defarge .
it had begun on monday , and here was wednesday come .
there had been more of early brooding than drinking ; for , many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door , who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls .
these were to the full as interested in the place , however , as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine ; and they glided from seat to seat , and from corner to corner , swallowing talk in lieu of drink , with greedy looks .
notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wineshop was not visible .
he was not missed ; for , nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him , nobody asked for him , nobody wondered to see only madame defarge in her seat , presiding over the distribution of wine , with a bowl of battered small coins before her , as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come .
a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind , were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wineshop , as they looked in at every place , high and low , from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol .
games at cards languished , players at dominoes musingly built towers with them , drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine , madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick , and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off .
thus , saint antoine in this vinous feature of his , until midday .
it was high noontide , when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps : of whom , one was monsieur defarge : the other a mender of roads in a blue cap .
all adust and athirst , the two entered the wineshop .
their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of saint antoine , fast spreading as they came along , which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows .
yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wineshop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them .
good day , gentlemen !
said monsieur defarge .
it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue .
it elicited an answering chorus of good day !
it is bad weather , gentlemen , said defarge , shaking his head .
upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent .
except one man , who got up and went out .
my wife , said defarge aloud , addressing madame defarge : i have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads , called jacques .
i met himby accidenta day and half's journey out of paris .
he is a good child , this mender of roads , called jacques .
give him to drink , my wife !
a second man got up and went out .
madame defarge set wine before the mender of roads called jacques , who doffed his blue cap to the company , and drank .
in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread ; he ate of this between whiles , and sat munching and drinking near madame defarge's counter .
a third man got up and went out .
defarge refreshed himself with a draught of winebut , he took less than was given to the stranger , as being himself a man to whom it was no rarityand stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast .
he looked at no one present , and no one now looked at him ; not even madame defarge , who had taken up her knitting , and was at work .
have you finished your repast , friend ?
he asked , in due season .
yes , thank you .
come , then !
you shall see the apartment that i told you you could occupy .
it will suit you to a marvel .
out of the wineshop into the street , out of the street into a courtyard , out of the courtyard up a steep staircase , out of the staircase into a garretformerly the garret where a whitehaired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes .
no whitehaired man was there now ; but , the three men were there who had gone out of the wineshop singly .
and between them and the whitehaired man afar off , was the one small link , that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall .
defarge closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : jacques one , jacques two , jacques three !
this is the witness encountered by appointment , by me , jacques four .
he will tell you all .
speak , jacques five !
the mender of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his swarthy forehead with it , and said , where shall i commence , monsieur ?
commence , was monsieur defarge's not unreasonable reply , at the commencement .
i saw him then , messieurs , began the mender of roads , a year ago this running summer , underneath the carriage of the marquis , hanging by the chain .
behold the manner of it .
i leaving my work on the road , the sun going to bed , the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill , he hanging by the chainlike this .
again the mender of roads went through the whole performance ; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year .
jacques one struck in , and asked if he had ever seen the man before ?
never , answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular .
jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ?
by his tall figure , said the mender of roads , softly , and with his finger at his nose .
when monsieur the marquis demands that evening , 'say , what is he like ?
'i make response , 'tall as a spectre .
'you should have said , short as a dwarf , returned jacques two .
but what did i know ?
the deed was not then accomplished , neither did he confide in me .
observe !
under those circumstances even , i do not offer my testimony .
monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger , standing near our little fountain , and says , 'to me !
bring that rascal !
'my faith , messieurs , i offer nothing .
he is right there , jacques , murmured defarge , to him who had interrupted .
go on !
good !
said the mender of roads , with an air of mystery .
the tall man is lost , and he is soughthow many months ?
nine , ten , eleven ?
no matter , the number , said defarge .
he is well hidden , but at last he is unluckily found .
go on !
i am again at work upon the hillside , and the sun is again about to go to bed .
i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below , where it is already dark , when i raise my eyes , and see coming over the hill six soldiers .
in the midst of them is a tall man with his arms boundtied to his sideslike this !
with the aid of his indispensable cap , he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips , with cords that were knotted behind him .
i stand aside , messieurs , by my heap of stones , to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass for it is a solitary road , that , where any spectacle is well worth looking at , and at first , as they approach , i see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound , and that they are almost black to my sightexcept on the side of the sun going to bed , where they have a red edge , messieurs .
also , i see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road , and are on the hill above it , and are like the shadows of giants .
also , i see that they are covered with dust , and that the dust moves with them as they come , tramp , tramp !
but when they advance quite near to me , i recognise the tall man , and he recognises me .
ah , but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hillside once again , as on the evening when he and i first encountered , close to the same spot !
he described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it vividly ; perhaps he had not seen much in his life .
i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man ; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me ; we do it , and we know it , with our eyes .
'come on !
'says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , 'bring him fast to his tomb !
'and they bring him faster .
i follow .
his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and clumsy , and he is lame .
because he is lame , and consequently slow , they drive him with their gunslike this !
he imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the buttends of muskets .
as they descend the hill like madmen running a race , he falls .
they laugh and pick him up again .
his face is bleeding and covered with dust , but he cannot touch it ; thereupon they laugh again .
they bring him into the village ; all the village runs to look ; they take him past the mill , and up to the prison ; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night , and swallow himlike this !
he opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth .
observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , defarge said , go on , jacques .
all the village , pursued the mender of roads , on tiptoe and in a low voice , withdraws ; all the village whispers by the fountain ; all the village sleeps ; all the village dreams of that unhappy one , within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag , and never to come out of it , except to perish .
in the morning , with my tools upon my shoulder , eating my morsel of black bread as i go , i make a circuit by the prison , on my way to my work .
there i see him , high up , behind the bars of a lofty iron cage , bloody and dusty as last night , looking through .
he has no hand free , to wave to me ; i dare not call to him ; he regards me like a dead man .
defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another .
the looks of all of them were dark , repressed , and revengeful , as they listened to the countryman's story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was authoritative too .
they had the air of a rough tribunal ; jacques one and two sitting on the old palletbed , each with his chin resting on his hand , and his eyes intent on the roadmender ; jacques three , equally intent , on one knee behind them , with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose ; defarge standing between them and the narrator , whom he had stationed in the light of the window , by turns looking from him to them , and from them to him .
go on , jacques , said defarge .
he remains up there in his iron cage some days .
the village looks at him by stealth , for it is afraid .
but it always looks up , from a distance , at the prison on the crag ; and in the evening , when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain , all faces are turned towards the prison .
formerly , they were turned towards the postinghouse ; now , they are turned towards the prison .
they whisper at the fountain , that although condemned to death he will not be executed ; they say that petitions have been presented in paris , showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child ; they say that a petition has been presented to the king himself .
what do i know ?
it is possible .
perhaps yes , perhaps no .
listen then , jacques , number one of that name sternly interposed .
know that a petition was presented to the king and queen .
all here , yourself excepted , saw the king take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the queen .
it is defarge whom you see here , who , at the hazard of his life , darted out before the horses , with the petition in his hand .
and once again listen , jacques !
said the kneeling number three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a strikingly greedy air , as if he hungered for somethingthat was neither food nor drink ; the guard , horse and foot , surrounded the petitioner , and struck him blows .
you hear ?
i hear , messieurs .
go on then , said defarge .
again ; on the other hand , they whisper at the fountain , resumed the countryman , that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot , and that he will very certainly be executed .
they even whisper that because he has slain monseigneur , and because monseigneur was the father of his tenantsserfswhat you willhe will be executed as a parricide .
one old man says at the fountain , that his right hand , armed with the knife , will be burnt off before his face ; that , into wounds which will be made in his arms , his breast , and his legs , there will be poured boiling oil , melted lead , hot resin , wax , and sulphur ; finally , that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses .
that old man says , all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late king , louis fifteen .
but how do i know if he lies ?
i am not a scholar .
listen once again then , jacques !
said the man with the restless hand and the craving air .
the name of that prisoner was damiens , and it was all done in open day , in the open streets of this city of paris ; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done , than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion , who were full of eager attention to the lastto the last , jacques , prolonged until nightfall , when he had lost two legs and an arm , and still breathed !
and it was donewhy , how old are you ?
thirtyfive , said the mender of roads , who looked sixty .
it was done when you were more than ten years old ; you might have seen it .
enough !
said defarge , with grim impatience .
long live the devil !
go on .
well !
some whisper this , some whisper that ; they speak of nothing else ; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune .
at length , on sunday night when all the village is asleep , come soldiers , winding down from the prison , and their guns ring on the stones of the little street .
workmen dig , workmen hammer , soldiers laugh and sing ; in the morning , by the fountain , there is raised a gallows forty feet high , poisoning the water .
the mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling , and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky .
all work is stopped , all assemble there , nobody leads the cows out , the cows are there with the rest .
at midday , the roll of drums .
soldiers have marched into the prison in the night , and he is in the midst of many soldiers .
he is bound as before , and in his mouth there is a gagtied so , with a tight string , making him look almost as if he laughed .
he suggested it , by creasing his face with his two thumbs , from the corners of his mouth to his ears .
on the top of the gallows is fixed the knife , blade upwards , with its point in the air .
he is hanged there forty feet highand is left hanging , poisoning the water .
they looked at one another , as he used his blue cap to wipe his face , on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle .
it is frightful , messieurs .
how can the women and the children draw water !
who can gossip of an evening , under that shadow !
under it , have i said ?
when i left the village , monday evening as the sun was going to bed , and looked back from the hill , the shadow struck across the church , across the mill , across the prisonseemed to strike across the earth , messieurs , to where the sky rests upon it !
the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him .
that's all , messieurs .
i left at sunset as i had been warned to do , and i walked on , that night and half next day , until i met as i was warned i should this comrade .
with him , i came on , now riding and now walking , through the rest of yesterday and through last night .
and here you see me !
after a gloomy silence , the first jacques said , good !
you have acted and recounted faithfully .
will you wait for us a little , outside the door ?
very willingly , said the mender of roads .
whom defarge escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned .
the three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret .
how say you , jacques ?
demanded number one .
to be registered ?
to be registered , as doomed to destruction , returned defarge .
magnificent !
croaked the man with the craving .
the chateau , and all the race ?
inquired the first .
the chateau and all the race , returned defarge .
extermination .
the hungry man repeated , in a rapturous croak , magnificent !
and began gnawing another finger .
are you sure , asked jacques two , of defarge , that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register ?
without doubt it is safe , for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it ; but shall we always be able to decipher itor , i ought to say , will she ?
jacques , returned defarge , drawing himself up , if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone , she would not lose a word of itnot a syllable of it .
knitted , in her own stitches and her own symbols , it will always be as plain to her as the sun .
confide in madame defarge .
it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives , to erase himself from existence , than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge .
there was a murmur of confidence and approval , and then the man who hungered , asked : is this rustic to be sent back soon ?
i hope so .
he is very simple ; is he not a little dangerous ?
he knows nothing , said defarge ; at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height .
i charge myself with him ; let him remain with me ; i will take care of him , and set him on his road .
he wishes to see the fine worldthe king , the queen , and court ; let him see them on sunday .
what ?
exclaimed the hungry man , staring .
is it a good sign , that he wishes to see royalty and nobility ?
jacques , said defarge ; judiciously show a cat milk , if you wish her to thirst for it .
judiciously show a dog his natural prey , if you wish him to bring it down one day .
nothing more was said , and the mender of roads , being found already dozing on the topmost stair , was advised to lay himself down on the palletbed and take some rest .
he needed no persuasion , and was soon asleep .
worse quarters than defarge's wineshop , could easily have been found in paris for a provincial slave of that degree .
saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable .
but , madame sat all day at her counter , so expressly unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her .
for , he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next ; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim , she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out .
therefore , when sunday came , the mender of roads was not enchanted though he said he was to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to versailles .
it was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there , in a public conveyance ; it was additionally disconcerting yet , to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the king and queen .
you work hard , madame , said a man near her .
yes , answered madame defarge ; i have a good deal to do .
what do you make , madame ?
many things .
for instance for instance , returned madame defarge , composedly , shrouds .
the man moved a little further away , as soon as he could , and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap : feeling it mightily close and oppressive .
if he needed a king and queen to restore him , he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand ; for , soon the largefaced king and the fairfaced queen came in their golden coach , attended by the shining bull's eye of their court , a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords ; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes , the mender of roads bathed himself , so much to his temporary intoxication , that he cried long live the king , long live the queen , long live everybody and everything !
as if he had never heard of ubiquitous jacques in his time .
then , there were gardens , courtyards , terraces , fountains , green banks , more king and queen , more bull's eye , more lords and ladies , more long live they all !
until he absolutely wept with sentiment .
during the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout defarge held him by the collar , as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces .
bravo !
said defarge , clapping him on the back when it was over , like a patron ; you are a good boy !
the mender of roads was now coming to himself , and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations ; but no .
you are the fellow we want , said defarge , in his ear ; you make these fools believe that it will last for ever .
then , they are the more insolent , and it is the nearer ended .
hey !
cried the mender of roads , reflectively ; that's true .
these fools know nothing .
while they despise your breath , and would stop it for ever and ever , in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs , they only know what your breath tells them .
let it deceive them , then , a little longer ; it cannot deceive them too much .
madame defarge looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation .
as to you , said she , you would shout and shed tears for anything , if it made a show and a noise .
say !
would you not ?
truly , madame , i think so .
for the moment .
if you were shown a great heap of dolls , and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage , you would pick out the richest and gayest .
say !
would you not ?
truly yes , madame .
yes .
and if you were shown a flock of birds , unable to fly , and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage , you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers ; would you not ?
it is true , madame .
you have seen both dolls and birds today , said madame defarge , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent ; now , go home !
madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of saint antoine , while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness , and through the dust , and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside , slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of monsieur the marquis , now in his grave , listened to the whispering trees .
such ample leisure had the stone faces , now , for listening to the trees and to the fountain , that the few village scarecrows who , in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn , strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase , had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered .
a rumour just lived in the villagehad a faint and bare existence there , as its people hadthat when the knife struck home , the faces changed , from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain ; also , that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain , they changed again , and bore a cruel look of being avenged , which they would henceforth bear for ever .
in the stone face over the great window of the bedchamber where the murder was done , two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose , which everybody recognised , and which nobody had seen of old ; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified , a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute , before they all started away among the moss and leaves , like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there .
chateau and hut , stone face and dangling figure , the red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village wellthousands of acres of landa whole province of franceall france itselflay under the night sky , concentrated into a faint hairbreadth line .
so does a whole world , with all its greatnesses and littlenesses , lie in a twinkling star .
and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it .
the defarges , husband and wife , came lumbering under the starlight , in their public vehicle , to that gate of paris whereunto their journey naturally tended .
there was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse , and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry .
monsieur defarge alighted ; knowing one or two of the soldiery there , and one of the police .
the latter he was intimate with , and affectionately embraced .
when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings , and they , having finally alighted near the saint's boundaries , were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets , madame defarge spoke to her husband : say then , my friend ; what did jacques of the police tell thee ?
very little tonight , but all he knows .
there is another spy commissioned for our quarter .
there may be many more , for all that he can say , but he knows of one .
eh well !
said madame defarge , raising her eyebrows with a cool business air .
it is necessary to register him .
how do they call that man ?
he is english .
so much the better .
his name ?
barsad , said defarge , making it french by pronunciation .
but , he had been so careful to get it accurately , that he then spelt it with perfect correctness .
barsad , repeated madame .
good .
christian name ?
john .
john barsad , repeated madame , after murmuring it once to herself .
good .
his appearance ; is it known ?
age , about forty years ; height , about five feet nine ; black hair ; complexion dark ; generally , rather handsome visage ; eyes dark , face thin , long , and sallow ; nose aquiline , but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek ; expression , therefore , sinister .
eh my faith .
it is a portrait !
said madame , laughing .
he shall be registered tomorrow .
they turned into the wineshop , which was closed for it was midnight , and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk , counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence , examined the stock , went through the entries in the book , made other entries of her own , checked the serving man in every possible way , and finally dismissed him to bed .
then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time , and began knotting them up in her handkerchief , in a chain of separate knots , for safe keeping through the night .
all this while , defarge , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , complacently admiring , but never interfering ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life .
the night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood , was illsmelling .
monsieur defarge's olfactory sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed .
he whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smokedout pipe .
you are fatigued , said madame , raising her glance as she knotted the money .
there are only the usual odours .
i am a little tired , her husband acknowledged .
you are a little depressed , too , said madame , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him .
oh , the men , the men !
but my dear !
began defarge .
but my dear !
repeated madame , nodding firmly ; but my dear !
you are faint of heart tonight , my dear !
well , then , said defarge , as if a thought were wrung out of his breast , it is a long time .
it is a long time , repeated his wife ; and when is it not a long time ?
vengeance and retribution require a long time ; it is the rule .
it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning , said defarge .
how long , demanded madame , composedly , does it take to make and store the lightning ?
tell me .
defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too .
it does not take a long time , said madame , for an earthquake to swallow a town .
eh well !
tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake ?
a long time , i suppose , said defarge .
but when it is ready , it takes place , and grinds to pieces everything before it .
in the meantime , it is always preparing , though it is not seen or heard .
that is your consolation .
keep it .
she tied a knot with flashing eyes , as if it throttled a foe .
i tell thee , said madame , extending her right hand , for emphasis , that although it is a long time on the road , it is on the road and coming .
i tell thee it never retreats , and never stops .
i tell thee it is always advancing .
look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know , consider the faces of all the world that we know , consider the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour .
can such things last ?
bah !
i mock you .
my brave wife , returned defarge , standing before her with his head a little bent , and his hands clasped at his back , like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist , i do not question all this .
but it has lasted a long time , and it is possibleyou know well , my wife , it is possiblethat it may not come , during our lives .
eh well !
how then ?
demanded madame , tying another knot , as if there were another enemy strangled .
well !
said defarge , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug .
we shall not see the triumph .
we shall have helped it , returned madame , with her extended hand in strong action .
nothing that we do , is done in vain .
i believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph .
but even if not , even if i knew certainly not , show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant , and still i would then madame , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed .
hold !
cried defarge , reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice ; i too , my dear , will stop at nothing .
yes !
but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity , to sustain you .
sustain yourself without that .
when the time comes , let loose a tiger and a devil ; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chainednot shownyet always ready .
madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out , and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner , and observing that it was time to go to bed .
next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wineshop , knitting away assiduously .
a rose lay beside her , and if she now and then glanced at the flower , it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air .
there were a few customers , drinking or not drinking , standing or seated , sprinkled about .
the day was very hot , and heaps of flies , who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame , fell dead at the bottom .
their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading , who looked at them in the coolest manner as if they themselves were elephants , or something as far removed , until they met the same fate .
curious to consider how heedless flies are !
perhapsthey thought as much at court that sunny summer day .
a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one .
she laid down her knitting , and began to pin her rose in her headdress , before she looked at the figure .
it was curious .
the moment madame defarge took up the rose , the customers ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the wineshop .
good day , madame , said the newcomer .
good day , monsieur .
she said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her knitting : hah !
good day , age about forty , height about five feet nine , black hair , generally rather handsome visage , complexion dark , eyes dark , thin , long and sallow face , aquiline nose but not straight , having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression !
good day , one and all !
have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac , and a mouthful of cool fresh water , madame .
madame complied with a polite air .
marvellous cognac this , madame !
it was the first time it had ever been so complimented , and madame defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better .
she said , however , that the cognac was flattered , and took up her knitting .
the visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general .
you knit with great skill , madame .
i am accustomed to it .
a pretty pattern too !
you think so ?
said madame , looking at him with a smile .
decidedly .
may one ask what it is for ?
pastime , said madame , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly .
not for use ?
that depends .
i may find a use for it one day .
if i dowell , said madame , drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry , i'll use it !
it was remarkable ; but , the taste of saint antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the headdress of madame defarge .
two men had entered separately , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away .
nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left .
they had all dropped off .
the spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign .
they had lounged away in a povertystricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable .
john , thought madame , checking off her work as her fingers knitted , and her eyes looked at the stranger .
stay long enough , and i shall knit 'barsad' before you go .
you have a husband , madame ?
i have .
children ?
no children .
business seems bad ?
business is very bad ; the people are so poor .
ah , the unfortunate , miserable people !
so oppressed , tooas you say .
as you say , madame retorted , correcting him , and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good .
pardon me ; certainly it was i who said so , but you naturally think so .
of course .
i think ?
returned madame , in a high voice .
i and my husband have enough to do to keep this wineshop open , without thinking .
all we think , here , is how to live .
that is the subject we think of , and it gives us , from morning to night , enough to think about , without embarrassing our heads concerning others .
i think for others ?
no , no .
the spy , who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make , did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face ; but , stood with an air of gossiping gallantry , leaning his elbow on madame defarge's little counter , and occasionally sipping his cognac .
a bad business this , madame , of gaspard's execution .
ah !
the poor gaspard !
with a sigh of great compassion .
my faith !
returned madame , coolly and lightly , if people use knives for such purposes , they have to pay for it .
he knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was ; he has paid the price .
i believe , said the spy , dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face : i believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood , touching the poor fellow ?
between ourselves .
is there ?
asked madame , vacantly .
is there not ?
here is my husband !
said madame defarge .
as the keeper of the wineshop entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , good day , jacques !
defarge stopped short , and stared at him .
good day , jacques !
the spy repeated ; with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare .
you deceive yourself , monsieur , returned the keeper of the wineshop .
you mistake me for another .
that is not my name .
i am ernest defarge .
it is all the same , said the spy , airily , but discomfited too : good day !
good day !
answered defarge , drily .
i was saying to madame , with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when you entered , that they tell me there isand no wonder !
muchsympathy and anger in saint antoine , touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard .
no one has told me so , said defarge , shaking his head .
i know nothing of it .
having said it , he passed behind the little counter , and stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair , looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed , and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction .
the spy , well used to his business , did not change his unconscious attitude , but drained his little glass of cognac , took a sip of fresh water , and asked for another glass of cognac .
madame defarge poured it out for him , took to her knitting again , and hummed a little song over it .
you seem to know this quarter well ; that is to say , better than i do ?
observed defarge .
not at all , but i hope to know it better .
i am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants .
hah !
muttered defarge .
the pleasure of conversing with you , monsieur defarge , recalls to me , pursued the spy , that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name .
indeed !
said defarge , with much indifference .
yes , indeed .
when doctor manette was released , you , his old domestic , had the charge of him , i know .
he was delivered to you .
you see i am informed of the circumstances ?
such is the fact , certainly , said defarge .
he had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and warbled , that he would do best to answer , but always with brevity .
it was to you , said the spy , that his daughter came ; and it was from your care that his daughter took him , accompanied by a neat brown monsieur ; how is he called ?
ina little wiglorryof the bank of tellson and companyover to england .
such is the fact , repeated defarge .
very interesting remembrances !
said the spy .
i have known doctor manette and his daughter , in england .
yes ?
said defarge .
you don't hear much about them now ?
said the spy .
no , said defarge .
in effect , madame struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , we never hear about them .
we received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two ; but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in lifewe , oursand we have held no correspondence .
perfectly so , madame , replied the spy .
she is going to be married .
going ?
echoed madame .
she was pretty enough to have been married long ago .
you english are cold , it seems to me .
oh !
you know i am english .
i perceive your tongue is , returned madame ; and what the tongue is , i suppose the man is .
he did not take the identification as a compliment ; but he made the best of it , and turned it off with a laugh .
after sipping his cognac to the end , he added : yes , miss manette is going to be married .
but not to an englishman ; to one who , like herself , is french by birth .
and speaking of gaspard ah , poor gaspard !
it was cruel , cruel !
 ,it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis , for whom gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet ; in other words , the present marquis .
but he lives unknown in england , he is no marquis there ; he is mr. charles darnay .
d'aulnais is the name of his mother's family .
madame defarge knitted steadily , but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband .
do what he would , behind the little counter , as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe , he was troubled , and his hand was not trustworthy .
the spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it , or to record it in his mind .
having made , at least , this one hit , whatever it might prove to be worth , and no customers coming in to help him to any other , mr. barsad paid for what he had drunk , and took his leave : taking occasion to say , in a genteel manner , before he departed , that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again .
for some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine , the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them , lest he should come back .
can it be true , said defarge , in a low voice , looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair : what he has said of ma'amselle manette ?
as he has said it , returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , it is probably false .
but it may be true .
if it is defarge began , and stopped .
if it is ?
repeated his wife .
and if it does come , while we live to see it triumphi hope , for her sake , destiny will keep her husband out of france .
her husband's destiny , said madame defarge , with her usual composure , will take him where he is to go , and will lead him to the end that is to end him .
that is all i know .
but it is very strangenow , at least , is it not very strangesaid defarge , rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it , that , after all our sympathy for monsieur her father , and herself , her husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment , by the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us ?
stranger things than that will happen when it does come , answered madame .
i have them both here , of a certainty ; and they are both here for their merits ; that is enough .
she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head .
either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone , or saint antoine was on the watch for its disappearance ; howbeit , the saint took courage to lounge in , very shortly afterwards , and the wineshop recovered its habitual aspect .
in the evening , at which season of all others saint antoine turned himself inside out , and sat on doorsteps and windowledges , and came to the corners of vile streets and courts , for a breath of air , madame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group : a missionarythere were many like hersuch as the world will do well never to breed again .
all the women knitted .
they knitted worthless things ; but , the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking ; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus : if the bony fingers had been still , the stomachs would have been more faminepinched .
but , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts .
and as madame defarge moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind .
her husband smoked at his door , looking after her with admiration .
a great woman , said he , a strong woman , a grand woman , a frightfully grand woman !
darkness closed around , and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard , as the women sat knitting , knitting .
darkness encompassed them .
another darkness was closing in as surely , when the church bells , then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france , should be melted into thundering cannon ; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice , that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty , freedom and life .
so much was closing in about the women who sat knitting , knitting , that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt , where they were to sit knitting , knitting , counting dropping heads .
never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in soho , than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat under the planetree together .
never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great london , than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves .
lucie was to be married tomorrow .
she had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the planetree .
you are happy , my dear father ?
quite , my child .
they had said little , though they had been there a long time .
when it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him .
she had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time ; but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so .
and i am very happy tonight , dear father .
i am deeply happy in the love that heaven has so blessedmy love for charles , and charles's love for me .
but , if my life were not to be still consecrated to you , or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us , even by the length of a few of these streets , i should be more unhappy and selfreproachful now than i can tell you .
even as it is even as it was , she could not command her voice .
in the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast .
in the moonlight which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself isas the light called human life isat its coming and its going .
dearest dear !
can you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever interpose between us ?
i know it well , but do you know it ?
in your own heart , do you feel quite certain ?
her father answered , with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed , quite sure , my darling !
more than that , he added , as he tenderly kissed her : my future is far brighter , lucie , seen through your marriage , than it could have beennay , than it ever waswithout it .
if i could hope that , my father !
believe it , love !
indeed it is so .
consider how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so .
you , devoted and young , cannot fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be wasted she moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word .
wasted , my childshould not be wasted , struck aside from the natural order of thingsfor my sake .
your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this ; but , only ask yourself , how could my happiness be perfect , while yours was incomplete ?
if i had never seen charles , my father , i should have been quite happy with you .
he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without charles , having seen him ; and replied : my child , you did see him , and it is charles .
if it had not been charles , it would have been another .
or , if it had been no other , i should have been the cause , and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself , and would have fallen on you .
it was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering .
it gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears ; and she remembered it long afterwards .
see !
said the doctor of beauvais , raising his hand towards the moon .
i have looked at her from my prisonwindow , when i could not bear her light .
i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what i had lost , that i have beaten my head against my prisonwalls .
i have looked at her , in a state so dull and lethargic , that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i could draw across her at the full , and the number of perpendicular lines with which i could intersect them .
he added in his inward and pondering manner , as he looked at the moon , it was twenty either way , i remember , and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in .
the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time , deepened as he dwelt upon it ; but , there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference .
he only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over .
i have looked at her , speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom i had been rent .
whether it was alive .
whether it had been born alive , or the poor mother's shock had killed it .
whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father .
there was a time in my imprisonment , when my desire for vengeance was unbearable .
whether it was a son who would never know his father's story ; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own will and act .
whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman .
she drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand .
i have pictured my daughter , to myself , as perfectly forgetful of merather , altogether ignorant of me , and unconscious of me .
i have cast up the years of her age , year after year .
i have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate .
i have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living , and in the next generation my place was a blank .
my father !
even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed , strikes to my heart as if i had been that child .
you , lucie ?
it is out of the consolation and restoration you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and the moon on this last night .
whatdid i say just now ?
she knew nothing of you .
she cared nothing for you .
so !
but on other moonlight nights , when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different wayhave affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its foundations couldi have imagined her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress .
i have seen her image in the moonlight often , as i now see you ; except that i never held her in my arms ; it stood between the little grated window and the door .
but , you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of ?
the figure was not ; thetheimage ; the fancy ?
no .
that was another thing .
it stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved .
the phantom that my mind pursued , was another and more real child .
of her outward appearance i know no more than that she was like her mother .
the other had that likeness tooas you havebut was not the same .
can you follow me , lucie ?
hardly , i think ?
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions .
his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition .
in that more peaceful state , i have imagined her , in the moonlight , coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father .
my picture was in her room , and i was in her prayers .
her life was active , cheerful , useful ; but my poor history pervaded it all .
i was that child , my father , i was not half so good , but in my love that was i .
and she showed me her children , said the doctor of beauvais , and they had heard of me , and had been taught to pity me .
when they passed a prison of the state , they kept far from its frowning walls , and looked up at its bars , and spoke in whispers .
she could never deliver me ; i imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things .
but then , blessed with the relief of tears , i fell upon my knees , and blessed her .
i am that child , i hope , my father .
o my dear , my dear , will you bless me as fervently tomorrow ?
lucie , i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have tonight for loving you better than words can tell , and thanking god for my great happiness .
my thoughts , when they were wildest , never rose near the happiness that i have known with you , and that we have before us .
he embraced her , solemnly commended her to heaven , and humbly thanked heaven for having bestowed her on him .
byandbye , they went into the house .
there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr. lorry ; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross .
the marriage was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more .
doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper .
they were only three at table , and miss pross made the third .
he regretted that charles was not there ; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away ; and drank to him affectionately .
so , the time came for him to bid lucie good night , and they separated .
but , in the stillness of the third hour of the morning , lucie came downstairs again , and stole into his room ; not free from unshaped fears , beforehand .
all things , however , were in their places ; all was quiet ; and he lay asleep , his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow , and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet .
she put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his ; then , leaned over him , and looked at him .
into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn ; but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep .
a more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant , was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep , that night .
she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be , and as his sorrows deserved .
then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away .
so , the sunrise came , and the shadows of the leaves of the planetree moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him .
the marriageday was shining brightly , and they were ready outside the closed door of the doctor's room , where he was speaking with charles darnay .
they were ready to go to church ; the beautiful bride , mr. lorry , and miss prossto whom the event , through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable , would have been one of absolute bliss , but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should have been the bridegroom .
and so , said mr. lorry , who could not sufficiently admire the bride , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress ; and so it was for this , my sweet lucie , that i brought you across the channel , such a baby !
lord bless me !
how little i thought what i was doing !
how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring on my friend mr. charles !
you didn't mean it , remarked the matteroffact miss pross , and therefore how could you know it ?
nonsense !
really ?
well ; but don't cry , said the gentle mr. lorry .
i am not crying , said miss pross ; you are .
i , my pross ?
by this time , mr. lorry dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion .
you were , just now ; i saw you do it , and i don't wonder at it .
such a present of plate as you have made 'em , is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes .
there's not a fork or a spoon in the collection , said miss pross , that i didn't cry over , last night after the box came , till i couldn't see it .
i am highly gratified , said mr. lorry , though , upon my honour , i had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one .
dear me !
this is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost .
dear , dear , dear !
to think that there might have been a mrs. lorry , any time these fifty years almost !
not at all !
from miss pross .
you think there never might have been a mrs. lorry ?
asked the gentleman of that name .
pooh !
rejoined miss pross ; you were a bachelor in your cradle .
well !
observed mr. lorry , beamingly adjusting his little wig , that seems probable , too .
and you were cut out for a bachelor , pursued miss pross , before you were put in your cradle .
then , i think , said mr. lorry , that i was very unhandsomely dealt with , and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern .
enough !
now , my dear lucie , drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , i hear them moving in the next room , and miss pross and i , as two formal folks of business , are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear .
you leave your good father , my dear , in hands as earnest and as loving as your own ; he shall be taken every conceivable care of ; during the next fortnight , while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts , even tellson's shall go to the wall comparatively speaking before him .
and when , at the fortnight's end , he comes to join you and your beloved husband , on your other fortnight's trip in wales , you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame .
now , i hear somebody's step coming to the door .
let me kiss my dear girl with an oldfashioned bachelor blessing , before somebody comes to claim his own .
for a moment , he held the fair face from him to look at the wellremembered expression on the forehead , and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig , with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which , if such things be oldfashioned , were as old as adam .
the door of the doctor's room opened , and he came out with charles darnay .
he was so deadly palewhich had not been the case when they went in togetherthat no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face .
but , in the composure of his manner he was unaltered , except that to the shrewd glance of mr. lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him , like a cold wind .
he gave his arm to his daughter , and took her downstairs to the chariot which mr. lorry had hired in honour of the day .
the rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married .
besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done , some diamonds , very bright and sparkling , glanced on the bride's hand , which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr. lorry's pockets .
they returned home to breakfast , and all went well , and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the paris garret , were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight , on the threshold of the door at parting .
it was a hard parting , though it was not for long .
but her father cheered her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms , take her , charles !
she is yours !
and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window , and she was gone .
the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious , and the preparations having been very simple and few , the doctor , mr. lorry , and miss pross , were left quite alone .
it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that mr. lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor ; as if the golden arm uplifted there , had struck him a poisoned blow .
he had naturally repressed much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone .
but , it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr. lorry ; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got upstairs , mr. lorry was reminded of defarge the wineshop keeper , and the starlight ride .
i think , he whispered to miss pross , after anxious consideration , i think we had best not speak to him just now , or at all disturb him .
i must look in at tellson's ; so i will go there at once and come back presently .
then , we will take him a ride into the country , and dine there , and all will be well .
it was easier for mr. lorry to look in at tellson's , than to look out of tellson's .
he was detained two hours .
when he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant ; going thus into the doctor's rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking .
good god !
he said , with a start .
what's that ?
miss pross , with a terrified face , was at his ear .
o me , o me !
all is lost !
cried she , wringing her hands .
what is to be told to ladybird ?
he doesn't know me , and is making shoes !
mr. lorry said what he could to calm her , and went himself into the doctor's room .
the bench was turned towards the light , as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before , and his head was bent down , and he was very busy .
doctor manette .
my dear friend , doctor manette !
the doctor looked at him for a momenthalf inquiringly , half as if he were angry at being spoken toand bent over his work again .
he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat ; his shirt was open at the throat , as it used to be when he did that work ; and even the old haggard , faded surface of face had come back to him .
he worked hardimpatientlyas if in some sense of having been interrupted .
mr. lorry glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape .
he took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was .
a young lady's walking shoe , he muttered , without looking up .
it ought to have been finished long ago .
let it be .
but , doctor manette .
look at me !
he obeyed , in the old mechanically submissive manner , without pausing in his work .
you know me , my dear friend ?
think again .
this is not your proper occupation .
think , dear friend !
nothing would induce him to speak more .
he looked up , for an instant at a time , when he was requested to do so ; but , no persuasion would extract a word from him .
he worked , and worked , and worked , in silence , and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall , or on the air .
the only ray of hope that mr. lorry could discover , was , that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked .
in that , there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexityas though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind .
two things at once impressed themselves on mr. lorry , as important above all others ; the first , that this must be kept secret from lucie ; the second , that it must be kept secret from all who knew him .
in conjunction with miss pross , he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution , by giving out that the doctor was not well , and required a few days of complete rest .
in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter , miss pross was to write , describing his having been called away professionally , and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand , represented to have been addressed to her by the same post .
these measures , advisable to be taken in any case , mr. lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself .
if that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve ; which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on the doctor's case .
in the hope of his recovery , and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable , mr. lorry resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so .
he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson's for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room .
he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became worried .
he abandoned that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen , or was falling .
he remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was a free place .
doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink , and worked on , that first day , until it was too dark to seeworked on , half an hour after mr. lorry could not have seen , for his life , to read or write .
when he put his tools aside as useless , until morning , mr. lorry rose and said to him : will you go out ?
he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner , looked up in the old manner , and repeated in the old low voice : out ?
yes ; for a walk with me .
why not ?
he made no effort to say why not , and said not a word more .
but , mr. lorry thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , why not ?
the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it .
miss pross and he divided the night into two watches , and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room .
he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down ; but , when he did finally lay himself down , he fell asleep .
in the morning , he was up betimes , and went straight to his bench and to work .
on this second day , mr. lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name , and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them .
he returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however confusedly .
this encouraged mr. lorry to have miss pross in with her work , several times during the day ; at those times , they quietly spoke of lucie , and of her father then present , precisely in the usual manner , and as if there were nothing amiss .
this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment , not long enough , or often enough to harass him ; and it lightened mr. lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener , and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him .
when it fell dark again , mr. lorry asked him as before : dear doctor , will you go out ?
as before , he repeated , out ?
yes ; for a walk with me .
why not ?
this time , mr. lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him , and , after remaining absent for an hour , returned .
in the meanwhile , the doctor had removed to the seat in the window , and had sat there looking down at the planetree ; but , on mr. lorry's return , he slipped away to his bench .
the time went very slowly on , and mr. lorry's hope darkened , and his heart grew heavier again , and grew yet heavier and heavier every day .
the third day came and went , the fourth , the fifth .
five days , six days , seven days , eight days , nine days .
with a hope ever darkening , and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier , mr. lorry passed through this anxious time .
the secret was well kept , and lucie was unconscious and happy ; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker , whose hand had been a little out at first , was growing dreadfully skilful , and that he had never been so intent on his work , and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert , as in the dusk of the ninth evening .
worn out by anxious watching , mr. lorry fell asleep at his post .
on the tenth morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night .
he rubbed his eyes and roused himself ; but he doubted , when he had done so , whether he was not still asleep .
for , going to the door of the doctor's room and looking in , he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again , and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window .
he was in his usual morning dress , and his face which mr. lorry could distinctly see , though still very pale , was calmly studious and attentive .
even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , mr. lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own ; for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual ; and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened ?
it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment , the answer being obvious .
if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause , how came he , jarvis lorry , there ?
how came he to have fallen asleep , in his clothes , on the sofa in doctor manette's consultingroom , and to be debating these points outside the doctor's bedroom door in the early morning ?
within a few minutes , miss pross stood whispering at his side .
if he had had any particle of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it ; but he was by that time clearheaded , and had none .
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfasthour , and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred .
if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , mr. lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain .
miss pross , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care .
having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , mr. lorry presented himself at the breakfasthour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg .
the doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast .
so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr. lorry felt to be the only safe advance , he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday .
an incidental allusion , purposely thrown out , to the day of the week , and the day of the month , set him thinking and counting , and evidently made him uneasy .
in all other respects , however , he was so composedly himself , that mr. lorry determined to have the aid he sought .
and that aid was his own .
therefore , when the breakfast was done and cleared away , and he and the doctor were left together , mr. lorry said , feelingly : my dear manette , i am anxious to have your opinion , in confidence , on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested ; that is to say , it is very curious to me ; perhaps , to your better information it may be less so .
glancing at his hands , which were discoloured by his late work , the doctor looked troubled , and listened attentively .
he had already glanced at his hands more than once .
doctor manette , said mr. lorry , touching him affectionately on the arm , the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine .
pray give your mind to it , and advise me well for his sakeand above all , for his daughter'shis daughter's , my dear manette .
if i understand , said the doctor , in a subdued tone , some mental shock ?
yes !
be explicit , said the doctor .
spare no detail .
mr. lorry saw that they understood one another , and proceeded .
my dear manette , it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock , of great acuteness and severity to the affections , the feelings , thetheas you express itthe mind .
the mind .
it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down , one cannot say for how long , because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself , and there are no other means of getting at it .
it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered , by a process that he cannot trace himselfas i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner .
it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered , so completely , as to be a highly intelligent man , capable of close application of mind , and great exertion of body , and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge , which was already very large .
but , unfortunately , there has been , he paused and took a deep breatha slight relapse .
the doctor , in a low voice , asked , of how long duration ?
nine days and nights .
how did it show itself ?
i infer , glancing at his hands again , in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock ?
that is the fact .
now , did you ever see him , asked the doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , engaged in that pursuit originally ?
once .
and when the relapse fell on him , was he in most respectsor in all respectsas he was then ?
i think in all respects .
you spoke of his daughter .
does his daughter know of the relapse ?
no .
it has been kept from her , and i hope will always be kept from her .
it is known only to myself , and to one other who may be trusted .
the doctor grasped his hand , and murmured , that was very kind .
that was very thoughtful !
mr. lorry grasped his hand in return , and neither of the two spoke for a little while .
now , my dear manette , said mr. lorry , at length , in his most considerate and most affectionate way , i am a mere man of business , and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters .
i do not possess the kind of information necessary ; i do not possess the kind of intelligence ; i want guiding .
there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance , as on you .
tell me , how does this relapse come about ?
is there danger of another ?
could a repetition of it be prevented ?
how should a repetition of it be treated ?
how does it come about at all ?
what can i do for my friend ?
no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend , than i am to serve mine , if i knew how .
but i don't know how to originate , in such a case .
if your sagacity , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , i might be able to do so much ; unenlightened and undirected , i can do so little .
pray discuss it with me ; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful .
doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken , and mr. lorry did not press him .
i think it probable , said the doctor , breaking silence with an effort , that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject .
was it dreaded by him ?
mr. lorry ventured to ask .
very much .
he said it with an involuntary shudder .
you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's mind , and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him .
would he , asked mr. lorry , be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him ?
i think so .
but it is , as i have told you , next to impossible .
i even believe itin some casesto be quite impossible .
now , said mr. lorry , gently laying his hand on the doctor's arm again , after a short silence on both sides , to what would you refer this attack ?
i believe , returned doctor manette , that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady .
some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled , i think .
it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind , that those associations would be recalledsay , under certain circumstancessay , on a particular occasion .
he tried to prepare himself in vain ; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it .
would he remember what took place in the relapse ?
asked mr. lorry , with natural hesitation .
the doctor looked desolately round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , not at all .
now , as to the future , hinted mr. lorry .
as to the future , said the doctor , recovering firmness , i should have great hope .
as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , i should have great hope .
he , yielding under the pressure of a complicated something , long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against , and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed , i should hope that the worst was over .
well , well !
that's good comfort .
i am thankful !
said mr. lorry .
i am thankful !
repeated the doctor , bending his head with reverence .
there are two other points , said mr. lorry , on which i am anxious to be instructed .
i may go on ?
you cannot do your friend a better service .
the doctor gave him his hand .
to the first , then .
he is of a studious habit , and unusually energetic ; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge , to the conducting of experiments , to many things .
now , does he do too much ?
i think not .
it may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation .
that may be , in part , natural to it ; in part , the result of affliction .
the less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction .
he may have observed himself , and made the discovery .
you are sure that he is not under too great a strain ?
i think i am quite sure of it .
my dear manette , if he were overworked now my dear lorry , i doubt if that could easily be .
there has been a violent stress in one direction , and it needs a counterweight .
excuse me , as a persistent man of business .
assuming for a moment , that he was overworked ; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder ?
i do not think so .
i do not think , said doctor manette with the firmness of selfconviction , that anything but the one train of association would renew it .
i think that , henceforth , nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it .
after what has happened , and after his recovery , i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again .
i trust , and i almost believe , that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted .
he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind , and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress .
it was not for his friend to abate that confidence .
he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was , and approached his second and last point .
he felt it to be the most difficult of all ; but , remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross , and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days , he knew that he must face it .
the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , said mr. lorry , clearing his throat , we will callblacksmith's work , blacksmith's work .
we will say , to put a case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little forge .
we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again .
is it not a pity that he should keep it by him ?
the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground .
he has always kept it by him , said mr. lorry , with an anxious look at his friend .
now , would it not be better that he should let it go ?
still , the doctor , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
you do not find it easy to advise me ?
said mr. lorry .
i quite understand it to be a nice question .
and yet i think and there he shook his head , and stopped .
you see , said doctor manette , turning to him after an uneasy pause , it is very hard to explain , consistently , the innermost workings of this poor man's mind .
he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation , and it was so welcome when it came ; no doubt it relieved his pain so much , by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain , and by substituting , as he became more practised , the ingenuity of the hands , for the ingenuity of the mental torture ; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach .
even now , when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been , and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence , the idea that he might need that old employment , and not find it , gives him a sudden sense of terror , like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child .
he looked like his illustration , as he raised his eyes to mr. lorry's face .
but may notmind !
i ask for information , as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas , shillings , and banknotesmay not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea ?
if the thing were gone , my dear manette , might not the fear go with it ?
in short , is it not a concession to the misgiving , to keep the forge ?
there was another silence .
you see , too , said the doctor , tremulously , it is such an old companion .
i would not keep it , said mr. lorry , shaking his head ; for he gained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted .
i would recommend him to sacrifice it .
i only want your authority .
i am sure it does no good .
come !
give me your authority , like a dear good man .
for his daughter's sake , my dear manette !
very strange to see what a struggle there was within him !
in her name , then , let it be done ; i sanction it .
but , i would not take it away while he was present .
let it be removed when he is not there ; let him miss his old companion after an absence .
mr. lorry readily engaged for that , and the conference was ended .
they passed the day in the country , and the doctor was quite restored .
on the three following days he remained perfectly well , and on the fourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband .
the precaution that had been taken to account for his silence , mr. lorry had previously explained to him , and he had written to lucie in accordance with it , and she had no suspicions .
on the night of the day on which he left the house , mr. lorry went into his room with a chopper , saw , chisel , and hammer , attended by miss pross carrying a light .
there , with closed doors , and in a mysterious and guilty manner , mr. lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces , while miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murderfor which , indeed , in her grimness , she was no unsuitable figure .
the burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire ; and the tools , shoes , and leather , were buried in the garden .
so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds , that mr. lorry and miss pross , while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces , almost felt , and almost looked , like accomplices in a horrible crime .
when the newlymarried pair came home , the first person who appeared , to offer his congratulations , was sydney carton .
they had not been at home many hours , when he presented himself .
he was not improved in habits , or in looks , or in manner ; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him , which was new to the observation of charles darnay .
he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window , and of speaking to him when no one overheard .
mr .
darnay , said carton , i wish we might be friends .
we are already friends , i hope .
you are good enough to say so , as a fashion of speech ; but , i don't mean any fashion of speech .
indeed , when i say i wish we might be friends , i scarcely mean quite that , either .
charles darnayas was naturalasked him , in all goodhumour and goodfellowship , what he did mean ?
upon my life , said carton , smiling , i find that easier to comprehend in my own mind , than to convey to yours .
however , let me try .
you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk thanthan usual ?
i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking .
i remember it too .
the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for i always remember them .
i hope it may be taken into account one day , when all days are at an end for me !
don't be alarmed ; i am not going to preach .
i am not at all alarmed .
earnestness in you , is anything but alarming to me .
ah !
said carton , with a careless wave of his hand , as if he waved that away .
on the drunken occasion in question one of a large number , as you know , i was insufferable about liking you , and not liking you .
i wish you would forget it .
i forgot it long ago .
fashion of speech again !
but , mr. darnay , oblivion is not so easy to me , as you represent it to be to you .
i have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it .
if it was a light answer , returned darnay , i beg your forgiveness for it .
i had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside .
i declare to you , on the faith of a gentleman , that i have long dismissed it from my mind .
good heaven , what was there to dismiss !
have i had nothing more important to remember , in the great service you rendered me that day ?
as to the great service , said carton , i am bound to avow to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional claptrap , i don't know that i cared what became of you , when i rendered it .
mind !
i say when i rendered it ; i am speaking of the past .
you make light of the obligation , returned darnay , but i will not quarrel with your light answer .
genuine truth , mr. darnay , trust me !
i have gone aside from my purpose ; i was speaking about our being friends .
now , you know me ; you know i am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men .
if you doubt it , ask stryver , and he'll tell you so .
i prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his .
well !
at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will .
i don't know that you 'never will .
'but i do , and you must take my word for it .
well !
if you could endure to have such a worthless fellow , and a fellow of such indifferent reputation , coming and going at odd times , i should ask that i might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here ; that i might be regarded as an useless and i would add , if it were not for the resemblance i detected between you and me , an unornamental piece of furniture , tolerated for its old service , and taken no notice of .
i doubt if i should abuse the permission .
it is a hundred to one if i should avail myself of it four times in a year .
it would satisfy me , i dare say , to know that i had it .
will you try ?
that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have indicated .
i thank you , darnay .
i may use that freedom with your name ?
i think so , carton , by this time .
they shook hands upon it , and sydney turned away .
within a minute afterwards , he was , to all outward appearance , as unsubstantial as ever .
when he was gone , and in the course of an evening passed with miss pross , the doctor , and mr. lorry , charles darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms , and spoke of sydney carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness .
he spoke of him , in short , not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him , but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself .
he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife ; but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked .
we are thoughtful tonight !
said darnay , drawing his arm about her .
yes , dearest charles , with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him ; we are rather thoughtful tonight , for we have something on our mind tonight .
what is it , my lucie ?
will you promise not to press one question on me , if i beg you not to ask it ?
will i promise ?
what will i not promise to my love ?
what , indeed , with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him !
i think , charles , poor mr. carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him tonight .
indeed , my own ?
why so ?
that is what you are not to ask me .
but i thinki knowhe does .
if you know it , it is enough .
what would you have me do , my life ?
i would ask you , dearest , to be very generous with him always , and very lenient on his faults when he is not by .
i would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very , very seldom reveals , and that there are deep wounds in it .
my dear , i have seen it bleeding .
it is a painful reflection to me , said charles darnay , quite astounded , that i should have done him any wrong .
i never thought this of him .
my husband , it is so .
i fear he is not to be reclaimed ; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now .
but , i am sure that he is capable of good things , gentle things , even magnanimous things .
she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man , that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours .
and , o my dearest love !
she urged , clinging nearer to him , laying her head upon his breast , and raising her eyes to his , remember how strong we are in our happiness , and how weak he is in his misery !
the supplication touched him home .
i will always remember it , dear heart !
i will remember it as long as i live .
he bent over the golden head , and put the rosy lips to his , and folded her in his arms .
if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the nightand the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time god bless her for her sweet compassion !
a wonderful corner for echoes , it has been remarked , that corner where the doctor lived .
ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband , and her father , and herself , and her old directress and companion , in a life of quiet bliss , lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner , listening to the echoing footsteps of years .
at first , there were times , though she was a perfectly happy young wife , when her work would slowly fall from her hands , and her eyes would be dimmed .
for , there was something coming in the echoes , something light , afar off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much .
fluttering hopes and doubtshopes , of a love as yet unknown to her : doubts , of her remaining upon earth , to enjoy that new delightdivided her breast .
among the echoes then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave ; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would mourn for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like waves .
that time passed , and her little lucie lay on her bosom .
then , among the advancing echoes , there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words .
let greater echoes resound as they would , the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming .
they came , and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh , and the divine friend of children , to whom in her trouble she had confided hers , seemed to take her child in his arms , as he took the child of old , and made it a sacred joy to her .
ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together , weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives , and making it predominate nowhere , lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds .
her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them ; her father's firm and equal .
lo , miss pross , in harness of string , awakening the echoes , as an unruly charger , whipcorrected , snorting and pawing the earth under the planetree in the garden !
even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest , they were not harsh nor cruel .
even when golden hair , like her own , lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy , and he said , with a radiant smile , dear papa and mamma , i am very sorry to leave you both , and to leave my pretty sister ; but i am called , and i must go !
those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek , as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it .
suffer them and forbid them not .
they see my father's face .
o father , blessed words !
thus , the rustling of an angel's wings got blended with the other echoes , and they were not wholly of earth , but had in them that breath of heaven .
sighs of the winds that blew over a little gardentomb were mingled with them also , and both were audible to lucie , in a hushed murmurlike the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shoreas the little lucie , comically studious at the task of the morning , or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool , chattered in the tongues of the two cities that were blended in her life .
the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton .
some halfdozen times a year , at most , he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited , and would sit among them through the evening , as he had once done often .
he never came there heated with wine .
and one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes , which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages .
no man ever really loved a woman , lost her , and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind , when she was a wife and a mother , but her children had a strange sympathy with himan instinctive delicacy of pity for him .
what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case , no echoes tell ; but it is so , and it was so here .
carton was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms , and he kept his place with her as she grew .
the little boy had spoken of him , almost at the last .
poor carton !
kiss him for me !
mr. stryver shouldered his way through the law , like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water , and dragged his useful friend in his wake , like a boat towed astern .
as the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight , and mostly under water , so , sydney had a swamped life of it .
but , easy and strong custom , unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace , made it the life he was to lead ; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion's jackal , than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion .
stryver was rich ; had married a florid widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads .
these three young gentlemen , mr. stryver , exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore , had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in soho , and had offered as pupils to lucie's husband : delicately saying halloa !
here are three lumps of breadandcheese towards your matrimonial picnic , darnay !
the polite rejection of the three lumps of breadandcheese had quite bloated mr. stryver with indignation , which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen , by directing them to beware of the pride of beggars , like that tutorfellow .
he was also in the habit of declaiming to mrs. stryver , over his fullbodied wine , on the arts mrs. darnay had once put in practice to catch him , and on the diamondcutdiamond arts in himself , madam , which had rendered him not to be caught .
some of his king's bench familiars , who were occasionally parties to the fullbodied wine and the lie , excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often , that he believed it himselfwhich is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence , as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot , and there hanged out of the way .
these were among the echoes to which lucie , sometimes pensive , sometimes amused and laughing , listened in the echoing corner , until her little daughter was six years old .
how near to her heart the echoes of her child's tread came , and those of her own dear father's , always active and selfpossessed , and those of her dear husband's , need not be told .
nor , how the lightest echo of their united home , directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste , was music to her .
nor , how there were echoes all about her , sweet in her ears , of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married if that could be than single , and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him , and asked her what is the magic secret , my darling , of your being everything to all of us , as if there were only one of us , yet never seeming to be hurried , or to have too much to do ?
but , there were other echoes , from a distance , that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time .
and it was now , about little lucie's sixth birthday , that they began to have an awful sound , as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising .
on a night in midjuly , one thousand seven hundred and eightynine , mr. lorry came in late , from tellson's , and sat himself down by lucie and her husband in the dark window .
it was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place .
i began to think , said mr. lorry , pushing his brown wig back , that i should have to pass the night at tellson's .
we have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn .
there is such an uneasiness in paris , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us !
our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
there is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to england .
that has a bad look , said darnay a bad look , you say , my dear darnay ?
yes , but we don't know what reason there is in it .
people are so unreasonable !
some of us at tellson's are getting old , and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion .
still , said darnay , you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is .
i know that , to be sure , assented mr. lorry , trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured , and that he grumbled , but i am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration .
where is manette ?
here he is , said the doctor , entering the dark room at the moment .
i am quite glad you are at home ; for these hurries and forebodings by which i have been surrounded all day long , have made me nervous without reason .
you are not going out , i hope ?
no ; i am going to play backgammon with you , if you like , said the doctor .
i don't think i do like , if i may speak my mind .
i am not fit to be pitted against you tonight .
is the teaboard still there , lucie ?
i can't see .
of course , it has been kept for you .
thank ye , my dear .
the precious child is safe in bed ?
and sleeping soundly .
that's right ; all safe and well !
i don't know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here , thank god ; but i have been so put out all day , and i am not as young as i was !
my tea , my dear !
thank ye .
now , come and take your place in the circle , and let us sit quiet , and hear the echoes about which you have your theory .
not a theory ; it was a fancy .
a fancy , then , my wise pet , said mr. lorry , patting her hand .
they are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not ?
only hear them !
headlong , mad , and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's life , footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red , the footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off , as the little circle sat in the dark london window .
saint antoine had been , that morning , a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro , with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads , where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun .
a tremendous roar arose from the throat of saint antoine , and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind : all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below , no matter how far off .
who gave them out , whence they last came , where they began , through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked , scores at a time , over the heads of the crowd , like a kind of lightning , no eye in the throng could have told ; but , muskets were being distributedso were cartridges , powder , and ball , bars of iron and wood , knives , axes , pikes , every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise .
people who could lay hold of nothing else , set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls .
every pulse and heart in saint antoine was on highfever strain and at highfever heat .
every living creature there held life as of no account , and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it .
as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point , so , all this raging circled round defarge's wineshop , and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself , already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat , issued orders , issued arms , thrust this man back , dragged this man forward , disarmed one to arm another , laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar .
keep near to me , jacques three , cried defarge ; and do you , jacques one and two , separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can .
where is my wife ?
eh , well !
here you see me !
said madame , composed as ever , but not knitting today .
madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
where do you go , my wife ?
i go , said madame , with you at present .
you shall see me at the head of women , byandbye .
come , then !
cried defarge , in a resounding voice .
patriots and friends , we are ready !
the bastille !
with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped into the detested word , the living sea rose , wave on wave , depth on depth , and overflowed the city to that point .
alarmbells ringing , drums beating , the sea raging and thundering on its new beach , the attack began .
deep ditches , double drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
through the fire and through the smokein the fire and in the smoke , for the sea cast him up against a cannon , and on the instant he became a cannonierdefarge of the wineshop worked like a manful soldier , two fierce hours .
deep ditch , single drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
one drawbridge down !
work , comrades all , work !
work , jacques one , jacques two , jacques one thousand , jacques two thousand , jacques fiveandtwenty thousand ; in the name of all the angels or the devilswhich you preferwork !
thus defarge of the wineshop , still at his gun , which had long grown hot .
to me , women !
cried madame his wife .
what !
we can kill as well as the men when the place is taken !
and to her , with a shrill thirsty cry , trooping women variously armed , but all armed alike in hunger and revenge .
cannon , muskets , fire and smoke ; but , still the deep ditch , the single drawbridge , the massive stone walls , and the eight great towers .
slight displacements of the raging sea , made by the falling wounded .
flashing weapons , blazing torches , smoking waggonloads of wet straw , hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions , shrieks , volleys , execrations , bravery without stint , boom smash and rattle , and the furious sounding of the living sea ; but , still the deep ditch , and the single drawbridge , and the massive stone walls , and the eight great towers , and still defarge of the wineshop at his gun , grown doubly hot by the service of four fierce hours .
a white flag from within the fortress , and a parleythis dimly perceptible through the raging storm , nothing audible in itsuddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher , and swept defarge of the wineshop over the lowered drawbridge , past the massive stone outer walls , in among the eight great towers surrendered !
so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on , that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the south sea , until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the bastille .
there , against an angle of a wall , he made a struggle to look about him .
jacques three was nearly at his side ; madame defarge , still heading some of her women , was visible in the inner distance , and her knife was in her hand .
everywhere was tumult , exultation , deafening and maniacal bewilderment , astounding noise , yet furious dumbshow .
the prisoners !
the records !
the secret cells !
the instruments of torture !
the prisoners !
of all these cries , and ten thousand incoherences , the prisoners !
was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in , as if there were an eternity of people , as well as of time and space .
when the foremost billows rolled past , bearing the prison officers with them , and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed , defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these mena man with a grey head , who had a lighted torch in his handseparated him from the rest , and got him between himself and the wall .
show me the north tower !
said defarge .
quick !
i will faithfully , replied the man , if you will come with me .
but there is no one there .
what is the meaning of one hundred and five , north tower ?
asked defarge .
quick !
the meaning , monsieur ?
does it mean a captive , or a place of captivity ?
or do you mean that i shall strike you dead ?
kill him !
croaked jacques three , who had come close up .
monsieur , it is a cell .
show it me !
pass this way , then .
jacques three , with his usual craving on him , and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed , held by defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's .
their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse , and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another , even then : so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean , in its irruption into the fortress , and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases .
all around outside , too , it beat the walls with a deep , hoarse roar , from which , occasionally , some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray .
through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone , past hideous doors of dark dens and cages , down cavernous flights of steps , and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick , more like dry waterfalls than staircases , defarge , the turnkey , and jacques three , linked hand and arm , went with all the speed they could make .
here and there , especially at first , the inundation started on them and swept by ; but when they had done descending , and were winding and climbing up a tower , they were alone .
hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches , the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull , subdued way , as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing .
the turnkey stopped at a low door , put a key in a clashing lock , swung the door slowly open , and said , as they all bent their heads and passed in : one hundred and five , north tower !
there was a small , heavilygrated , unglazed window high in the wall , with a stone screen before it , so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up .
there was a small chimney , heavily barred across , a few feet within .
there was a heap of old feathery woodashes on the hearth .
there was a stool , and table , and a straw bed .
there were the four blackened walls , and a rusted iron ring in one of them .
pass that torch slowly along these walls , that i may see them , said defarge to the turnkey .
the man obeyed , and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes .
stop !
lookhere , jacques !
a .
m .
 !
croaked jacques three , as he read greedily .
alexandre manette , said defarge in his ear , following the letters with his swart forefinger , deeply engrained with gunpowder .
and here he wrote 'a poor physician .
'and it was he , without doubt , who scratched a calendar on this stone .
what is that in your hand ?
a crowbar ?
give it me !
he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand .
he made a sudden exchange of the two instruments , and turning on the wormeaten stool and table , beat them to pieces in a few blows .
hold the light higher !
he said , wrathfully , to the turnkey .
look among those fragments with care , jacques .
and see !
here is my knife , throwing it to him ; rip open that bed , and search the straw .
hold the light higher , you !
with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth , and , peering up the chimney , struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar , and worked at the iron grating across it .
in a few minutes , some mortar and dust came dropping down , which he averted his face to avoid ; and in it , and in the old woodashes , and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself , he groped with a cautious touch .
nothing in the wood , and nothing in the straw , jacques ?
nothing .
let us collect them together , in the middle of the cell .
so !
light them , you !
the turnkey fired the little pile , which blazed high and hot .
stooping again to come out at the lowarched door , they left it burning , and retraced their way to the courtyard ; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in the raging flood once more .
they found it surging and tossing , in quest of defarge himself .
saint antoine was clamorous to have its wineshop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people .
otherwise , the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for judgment .
otherwise , the governor would escape , and the people's blood suddenly of some value , after many years of worthlessness be unavenged .
in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration , there was but one quite steady figure , and that was a woman's .
see , there is my husband !
she cried , pointing him out .
see defarge !
she stood immovable close to the grim old officer , and remained immovable close to him ; remained immovable close to him through the streets , as defarge and the rest bore him along ; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination , and began to be struck at from behind ; remained immovable close to him when the longgathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy ; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it , that , suddenly animated , she put her foot upon his neck , and with her cruel knifelong readyhewed off his head .
the hour was come , when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do .
saint antoine's blood was up , and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was downdown on the steps of the hotel de ville where the governor's body laydown on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation .
lower the lamp yonder !
cried saint antoine , after glaring round for a new means of death ; here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard !
the swinging sentinel was posted , and the sea rushed on .
the sea of black and threatening waters , and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave , whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown .
the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes , voices of vengeance , and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them .
but , in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life , there were two groups of faceseach seven in numberso fixedly contrasting with the rest , that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it .
seven faces of prisoners , suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb , were carried high overhead : all scared , all lost , all wondering and amazed , as if the last day were come , and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits .
other seven faces there were , carried higher , seven dead faces , whose drooping eyelids and halfseen eyes awaited the last day .
impassive faces , yet with a suspendednot an abolishedexpression on them ; faces , rather , in a fearful pause , as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes , and bear witness with the bloodless lips , thou didst it !
seven prisoners released , seven gory heads on pikes , the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers , some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time , long dead of broken hearts ,such , and suchlike , the loudly echoing footsteps of saint antoine escort through the paris streets in midjuly , one thousand seven hundred and eightynine .
now , heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay , and keep these feet far out of her life !
for , they are headlong , mad , and dangerous ; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at defarge's wineshop door , they are not easily purified when once stained red .
haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week , in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could , with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations , when madame defarge sat at her counter , as usual , presiding over the customers .
madame defarge wore no rose in her head , for the great brotherhood of spies had become , even in one short week , extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies .
the lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them .
madame defarge , with her arms folded , sat in the morning light and heat , contemplating the wineshop and the street .
in both , there were several knots of loungers , squalid and miserable , but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress .
the raggedest nightcap , awry on the wretchedest head , had this crooked significance in it : i know how hard it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to support life in myself ; but do you know how easy it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to destroy life in you ?
every lean bare arm , that had been without work before , had this work always ready for it now , that it could strike .
the fingers of the knitting women were vicious , with the experience that they could tear .
there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine ; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years , and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression .
madame defarge sat observing it , with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women .
one of her sisterhood knitted beside her .
the short , rather plump wife of a starved grocer , and the mother of two children withal , this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance .
hark !
said the vengeance .
listen , then !
who comes ?
as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine quarter to the wineshop door , had been suddenly fired , a fastspreading murmur came rushing along .
it is defarge , said madame .
silence , patriots !
defarge came in breathless , pulled off a red cap he wore , and looked around him !
listen , everywhere !
said madame again .
listen to him !
defarge stood , panting , against a background of eager eyes and open mouths , formed outside the door ; all those within the wineshop had sprung to their feet .
say then , my husband .
what is it ?
news from the other world !
how , then ?
cried madame , contemptuously .
the other world ?
does everybody here recall old foulon , who told the famished people that they might eat grass , and who died , and went to hell ?
everybody !
from all throats .
the news is of him .
he is among us !
among us !
from the universal throat again .
and dead ?
not dead !
he feared us so muchand with reasonthat he caused himself to be represented as dead , and had a grand mockfuneral .
but they have found him alive , hiding in the country , and have brought him in .
i have seen him but now , on his way to the hotel de ville , a prisoner .
i have said that he had reason to fear us .
say all !
had he reason ?
wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten , if he had never known it yet , he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry .
a moment of profound silence followed .
defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another .
the vengeance stooped , and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter .
patriots !
said defarge , in a determined voice , are we ready ?
instantly madame defarge's knife was in her girdle ; the drum was beating in the streets , as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic ; and the vengeance , uttering terrific shrieks , and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty furies at once , was tearing from house to house , rousing the women .
the men were terrible , in the bloodyminded anger with which they looked from windows , caught up what arms they had , and came pouring down into the streets ; but , the women were a sight to chill the boldest .
from such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded , from their children , from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked , they ran out with streaming hair , urging one another , and themselves , to madness with the wildest cries and actions .
villain foulon taken , my sister !
old foulon taken , my mother !
miscreant foulon taken , my daughter !
then , a score of others ran into the midst of these , beating their breasts , tearing their hair , and screaming , foulon alive !
foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass !
foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass , when i had no bread to give him !
foulon who told my baby it might suck grass , when these breasts were dry with want !
o mother of god , this foulon !
o heaven our suffering !
hear me , my dead baby and my withered father : i swear on my knees , on these stones , to avenge you on foulon !
husbands , and brothers , and young men , give us the blood of foulon , give us the head of foulon , give us the heart of foulon , give us the body and soul of foulon , rend foulon to pieces , and dig him into the ground , that grass may grow from him !
with these cries , numbers of the women , lashed into blind frenzy , whirled about , striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon , and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot .
nevertheless , not a moment was lost ; not a moment !
this foulon was at the hotel de ville , and might be loosed .
never , if saint antoine knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs !
armed men and women flocked out of the quarter so fast , and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in saint antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children .
no .
they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where this old man , ugly and wicked , was , and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets .
the defarges , husband and wife , the vengeance , and jacques three , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the hall .
see !
cried madame , pointing with her knife .
see the old villain bound with ropes .
that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back .
ha , ha !
that was well done .
let him eat it now !
madame put her knife under her arm , and clapped her hands as at a play .
the people immediately behind madame defarge , explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them , and those again explaining to others , and those to others , the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands .
similarly , during two or three hours of drawl , and the winnowing of many bushels of words , madame defarge's frequent expressions of impatience were taken up , with marvellous quickness , at a distance : the more readily , because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows , knew madame defarge well , and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building .
at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection , directly down upon the old prisoner's head .
the favour was too much to bear ; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long , went to the winds , and saint antoine had got him !
it was known directly , to the furthest confines of the crowd .
defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table , and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embracemadame defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tiedthe vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them , and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall , like birds of prey from their high percheswhen the cry seemed to go up , all over the city , bring him out !
bring him to the lamp !
down , and up , and head foremost on the steps of the building ; now , on his knees ; now , on his feet ; now , on his back ; dragged , and struck at , and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands ; torn , bruised , panting , bleeding , yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy ; now full of vehement agony of action , with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see ; now , a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs ; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung , and there madame defarge let him goas a cat might have done to a mouseand silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready , and while he besought her : the women passionately screeching at him all the time , and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth .
once , he went aloft , and the rope broke , and they caught him shrieking ; twice , he went aloft , and the rope broke , and they caught him shrieking ; then , the rope was merciful , and held him , and his head was soon upon a pike , with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of .
nor was this the end of the day's bad work , for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up , that it boiled again , on hearing when the day closed in that the soninlaw of the despatched , another of the people's enemies and insulters , was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong , in cavalry alone .
saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper , seized himwould have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon companyset his head and heart on pikes , and carried the three spoils of the day , in wolfprocession through the streets .
not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , wailing and breadless .
then , the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread ; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty , they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day , and achieving them again in gossip .
gradually , these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away ; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows , and slender fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours cooked in common , afterwards supping at their doors .
scanty and insufficient suppers those , and innocent of meat , as of most other sauce to wretched bread .
yet , human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands , and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them .
fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day , played gently with their meagre children ; and lovers , with such a world around them and before them , loved and hoped .
it was almost morning , when defarge's wineshop parted with its last knot of customers , and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife , in husky tones , while fastening the door : at last it is come , my dear !
eh well !
returned madame .
almost .
saint antoine slept , the defarges slept : even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer , and the drum was at rest .
the drum's was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed .
the vengeance , as custodian of the drum , could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell , or old foulon was seized ; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine's bosom .
there was a change on the village where the fountain fell , and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together .
the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore ; there were soldiers to guard it , but not many ; there were officers to guard the soldiers , but not one of them knew what his men would dobeyond this : that it would probably not be what he was ordered .
far and wide lay a ruined country , yielding nothing but desolation .
every green leaf , every blade of grass and blade of grain , was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people .
everything was bowed down , dejected , oppressed , and broken .
habitations , fences , domesticated animals , men , women , children , and the soil that bore themall worn out .
monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national blessing , gave a chivalrous tone to things , was a polite example of luxurious and shining life , and a great deal more to equal purpose ; nevertheless , monseigneur as a class had , somehow or other , brought things to this .
strange that creation , designed expressly for monseigneur , should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out !
there must be something shortsighted in the eternal arrangements , surely !
thus it was , however ; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints , and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled , and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite , monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable .
but , this was not the change on the village , and on many a village like it .
for scores of years gone by , monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chasenow , found in hunting the people ; now , found in hunting the beasts , for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness .
no .
the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste , rather than in the disappearance of the high caste , chiselled , and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur .
for , in these times , as the mender of roads worked , solitary , in the dust , not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return , being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had itin these times , as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour , and viewed the prospect , he would see some rough figure approaching on foot , the like of which was once a rarity in those parts , but was now a frequent presence .
as it advanced , the mender of roads would discern without surprise , that it was a shaggyhaired man , of almost barbarian aspect , tall , in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads , grim , rough , swart , steeped in the mud and dust of many highways , dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds , sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods .
such a man came upon him , like a ghost , at noon in the july weather , as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank , taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail .
the man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , at the mill , and at the prison on the crag .
when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had , he said , in a dialect that was just intelligible : how goes it , jacques ?
all well , jacques .
touch then !
they joined hands , and the man sat down on the heap of stones .
no dinner ?
nothing but supper now , said the mender of roads , with a hungry face .
it is the fashion , growled the man .
i meet no dinner anywhere .
he took out a blackened pipe , filled it , lighted it with flint and steel , pulled at it until it was in a bright glow : then , suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb , that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke .
touch then .
it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations .
they again joined hands .
tonight ?
said the mender of roads .
tonight , said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth .
where ?
here .
he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another , with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets , until the sky began to clear over the village .
show me !
said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill .
see !
returned the mender of roads , with extended finger .
you go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain to the devil with all that !
interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape .
i go through no streets and past no fountains .
well ?
well !
about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village .
good .
when do you cease to work ?
at sunset .
will you wake me , before departing ?
i have walked two nights without resting .
let me finish my pipe , and i shall sleep like a child .
will you wake me ?
surely .
the wayfarer smoked his pipe out , put it in his breast , slipped off his great wooden shoes , and lay down on his back on the heap of stones .
he was fast asleep directly .
as the roadmender plied his dusty labour , and the hailclouds , rolling away , revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape , the little man who wore a red cap now , in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones .
his eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account .
the bronze face , the shaggy black hair and beard , the coarse woollen red cap , the rough medley dress of homespun stuff and hairy skins of beasts , the powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep , inspired the mender of roads with awe .
the traveller had travelled far , and his feet were footsore , and his ankles chafed and bleeding ; his great shoes , stuffed with leaves and grass , had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues , and his clothes were chafed into holes , as he himself was into sores .
stooping down beside him , the roadmender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not ; but , in vain , for he slept with his arms crossed upon him , and set as resolutely as his lips .
fortified towns with their stockades , guardhouses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges , seemed to the mender of roads , to be so much air as against this figure .
and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around , he saw in his small fancy similar figures , stopped by no obstacle , tending to centres all over france .
the man slept on , indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness , to sunshine on his face and shadow , to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them , until the sun was low in the west , and the sky was glowing .
then , the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him .
good !
said the sleeper , rising on his elbow .
two leagues beyond the summit of the hill ?
about .
about .
good !
the mender of roads went home , with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind , and was soon at the fountain , squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink , and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village .
when the village had taken its poor supper , it did not creep to bed , as it usually did , but came out of doors again , and remained there .
a curious contagion of whispering was upon it , and also , when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark , another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only .
monsieur gabelle , chief functionary of the place , became uneasy ; went out on his housetop alone , and looked in that direction too ; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below , and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church , that there might be need to ring the tocsin byandbye .
the night deepened .
the trees environing the old chateau , keeping its solitary state apart , moved in a rising wind , as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom .
up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly , and beat at the great door , like a swift messenger rousing those within ; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall , among the old spears and knives , and passed lamenting up the stairs , and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept .
east , west , north , and south , through the woods , four heavytreading , unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches , striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard .
four lights broke out there , and moved away in different directions , and all was black again .
but , not for long .
presently , the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own , as though it were growing luminous .
then , a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front , picking out transparent places , and showing where balustrades , arches , and windows were .
then it soared higher , and grew broader and brighter .
soon , from a score of the great windows , flames burst forth , and the stone faces awakened , stared out of fire .
a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there , and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away .
there was spurring and splashing through the darkness , and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain , and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle's door .
help , gabelle !
help , every one !
the tocsin rang impatiently , but other help if that were any there was none .
the mender of roads , and two hundred and fifty particular friends , stood with folded arms at the fountain , looking at the pillar of fire in the sky .
it must be forty feet high , said they , grimly ; and never moved .
the rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away through the village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag .
at the gate , a group of officers were looking at the fire ; removed from them , a group of soldiers .
help , gentlemenofficers !
the chateau is on fire ; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid !
help , help !
the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire ; gave no orders ; and answered , with shrugs and biting of lips , it must burn .
as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street , the village was illuminating .
the mender of roads , and the two hundred and fifty particular friends , inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up , had darted into their houses , and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass .
the general scarcity of everything , occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle ; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part , the mender of roads , once so submissive to authority , had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with , and that posthorses would roast .
the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn .
in the roaring and raging of the conflagration , a redhot wind , driving straight from the infernal regions , seemed to be blowing the edifice away .
with the rising and falling of the blaze , the stone faces showed as if they were in torment .
when great masses of stone and timber fell , the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured : anon struggled out of the smoke again , as if it were the face of the cruel marquis , burning at the stake and contending with the fire .
the chateau burned ; the nearest trees , laid hold of by the fire , scorched and shrivelled ; trees at a distance , fired by the four fierce figures , begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke .
molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain ; the water ran dry ; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat , and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame .
great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls , like crystallisation ; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace ; four fierce figures trudged away , east , west , north , and south , along the nightenshrouded roads , guided by the beacon they had lighted , towards their next destination .
the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin , and , abolishing the lawful ringer , rang for joy .
not only that ; but the village , lightheaded with famine , fire , and bellringing , and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment of taxes , and no rent at all , that gabelle had got in those latter daysbecame impatient for an interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forth for personal conference .
whereupon , monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door , and retire to hold counsel with himself .
the result of that conference was , that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament , to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet , and crush a man or two below .
probably , monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there , with the distant chateau for fire and candle , and the beating at his door , combined with the joyringing , for music ; not to mention his having an illomened lamp slung across the road before his postinghouse gate , which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour .
a trying suspense , to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean , ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved !
but , the friendly dawn appearing at last , and the rushcandles of the village guttering out , the people happily dispersed , and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while .
within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across oncepeaceful streets , where they had been born and bred ; also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn .
but , the fierce figures were steadily wending east , west , north , and south , be that as it would ; and whosoever hung , fire burned .
the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able to calculate successfully .
in such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years of tempest were consumed .
three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home .
many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet .
for , the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people , tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger , changed into wild beasts , by terrible enchantment long persisted in .
monseigneur , as a class , had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated : of his being so little wanted in france , as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it , and this life together .
like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains , and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question , but immediately fled ; so , monseigneur , after boldly reading the lord's prayer backwards for a great number of years , and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one , no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels .
the shining bull's eye of the court was gone , or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets .
it had never been a good eye to see withhad long had the mote in it of lucifer's pride , sardanapalus's luxury , and a mole's blindnessbut it had dropped out and was gone .
the court , from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue , corruption , and dissimulation , was all gone together .
royalty was gone ; had been besieged in its palace and suspended , when the last tidings came over .
the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo was come , and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide .
as was natural , the headquarters and great gatheringplace of monseigneur , in london , was tellson's bank .
spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted , and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be .
moreover , it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon , came quickest .
again : tellson's was a munificent house , and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate .
again : those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time , and anticipating plunder or confiscation , had made provident remittances to tellson's , were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren .
to which it must be added that every newcomer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson's , almost as a matter of course .
for such variety of reasons , tellson's was at that time , as to french intelligence , a kind of high exchange ; and this was so well known to the public , and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows , for all who ran through temple bar to read .
on a steaming , misty afternoon , mr. lorry sat at his desk , and charles darnay stood leaning on it , talking with him in a low voice .
the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house , was now the newsexchange , and was filled to overflowing .
it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing .
but , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , said charles darnay , rather hesitating , i must still suggest to you i understand .
that i am too old ?
said mr. lorry .
unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you .
my dear charles , said mr. lorry , with cheerful confidence , you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my staying away .
it is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with .
as to its being a disorganised city , if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our house here to our house there , who knows the city and the business , of old , and is in tellson's confidence .
as to the uncertain travelling , the long journey , and the winter weather , if i were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellson's , after all these years , who ought to be ?
i wish i were going myself , said charles darnay , somewhat restlessly , and like one thinking aloud .
indeed !
you are a pretty fellow to object and advise !
exclaimed mr. lorry .
you wish you were going yourself ?
and you a frenchman born ?
you are a wise counsellor .
my dear mr. lorry , it is because i am a frenchman born , that the thought which i did not mean to utter here , however has passed through my mind often .
one cannot help thinking , having had some sympathy for the miserable people , and having abandoned something to them , he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner , that one might be listened to , and might have the power to persuade to some restraint .
only last night , after you had left us , when i was talking to lucie when you were talking to lucie , mr. lorry repeated .
yes .
i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie !
wishing you were going to france at this time of day !
however , i am not going , said charles darnay , with a smile .
it is more to the purpose that you say you are .
and i am , in plain reality .
the truth is , my dear charles , mr. lorry glanced at the distant house , and lowered his voice , you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted , and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved .
the lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of our documents were seized or destroyed ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that paris is not set afire today , or sacked tomorrow !
now , a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay , and the burying of them , or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way , is within the power without loss of precious time of scarcely any one but myself , if any one .
and shall i hang back , when tellson's knows this and says thistellson's , whose bread i have eaten these sixty yearsbecause i am a little stiff about the joints ?
why , i am a boy , sir , to half a dozen old codgers here !
how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , mr. lorry .
tut !
nonsense , sir !
and ,my dear charles , said mr. lorry , glancing at the house again , you are to remember , that getting things out of paris at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility .
papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here i speak in strict confidence ; it is not businesslike to whisper it , even to you , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the barriers .
at another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in businesslike old england ; but now , everything is stopped .
and do you really go tonight ?
i really go tonight , for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay .
and do you take no one with you ?
all sorts of people have been proposed to me , but i will have nothing to say to any of them .
i intend to take jerry .
jerry has been my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him .
nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bulldog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master .
i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness .
i must say again , nonsense , nonsense !
when i have executed this little commission , i shall , perhaps , accept tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease .
time enough , then , to think about growing old .
this dialogue had taken place at mr. lorry's usual desk , with monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it , boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascalpeople before long .
it was too much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee , and it was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy , to talk of this terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sownas if nothing had ever been done , or omitted to be done , that had led to itas if observers of the wretched millions in france , and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous , had not seen it inevitably coming , years before , and had not in plain words recorded what they saw .
such vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth .
and it was such vapouring all about his ears , like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to a latent uneasiness in his mind , which had already made charles darnay restless , and which still kept him so .
among the talkers , was stryver , of the king's bench bar , far on his way to state promotion , and , therefore , loud on the theme : broaching to monseigneur , his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth , and doing without them : and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race .
him , darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection ; and darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more , and remaining to interpose his word , when the thing that was to be , went on to shape itself out .
the house approached mr. lorry , and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him , asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed ?
the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the directionthe more quickly because it was his own right name .
the address , turned into english , ran : very pressing .
to monsieur heretofore the marquis st .
evremonde , of france .
confided to the cares of messrs .
tellson and co .
 ,bankers , london , england .
on the marriage morning , doctor manette had made it his one urgent and express request to charles darnay , that the secret of this name should beunless he , the doctor , dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them .
nobody else knew it to be his name ; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact ; mr. lorry could have none .
no , said mr. lorry , in reply to the house ; i have referred it , i think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found .
the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank , there was a general set of the current of talkers past mr. lorry's desk .
he held the letter out inquiringly ; and monseigneur looked at it , in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee ; and monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee ; and this , that , and the other , all had something disparaging to say , in french or in english , concerning the marquis who was not to be found .
nephew , i believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polished marquis who was murdered , said one .
happy to say , i never knew him .
a craven who abandoned his post , said anotherthis monseigneur had been got out of paris , legs uppermost and half suffocated , in a load of haysome years ago .
infected with the new doctrines , said a third , eyeing the direction through his glass in passing ; set himself in opposition to the last marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd .
they will recompense him now , i hope , as he deserves .
hey ?
cried the blatant stryver .
did he though ?
is that the sort of fellow ?
let us look at his infamous name .
dn the fellow !
darnay , unable to restrain himself any longer , touched mr. stryver on the shoulder , and said : i know the fellow .
do you , by jupiter ?
said stryver .
i am sorry for it .
why ?
why , mr. darnay ?
d'ye hear what he did ?
don't ask , why , in these times .
but i do ask why ?
then i tell you again , mr. darnay , i am sorry for it .
i am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions .
here is a fellow , who , infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known , abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale , and you ask me why i am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him ?
well , but i'll answer you .
i am sorry because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel .
that's why .
mindful of the secret , darnay with great difficulty checked himself , and said : you may not understand the gentleman .
i understand how to put you in a corner , mr. darnay , said bully stryver , and i'll do it .
if this fellow is a gentleman , i don't understand him .
you may tell him so , with my compliments .
you may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , i wonder he is not at the head of them .
but , no , gentlemen , said stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , i know something of human nature , and i tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protgs .
no , gentlemen ; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away .
with those words , and a final snap of his fingers , mr. stryver shouldered himself into fleetstreet , amidst the general approbation of his hearers .
mr. lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the bank .
will you take charge of the letter ?
said mr. lorry .
you know where to deliver it ?
i do .
will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time ?
i will do so .
do you start for paris from here ?
from here , at eight .
i will come back , to see you off .
very ill at ease with himself , and with stryver and most other men , darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple , opened the letter , and read it .
these were its contents : prison of the abbaye , paris .
june 21 , 1792 .
monsieur heretofore the marquis .
after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village , i have been seized , with great violence and indignity , and brought a long journey on foot to paris .
on the road i have suffered a great deal .
nor is that all ; my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground .
the crime for which i am imprisoned , monsieur heretofore the marquis , and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal , and shall lose my life without your so generous help , is , they tell me , treason against the majesty of the people , in that i have acted against them for an emigrant .
it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them , and not against , according to your commands .
it is in vain i represent that , before the sequestration of emigrant property , i had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay ; that i had collected no rent ; that i had had recourse to no process .
the only response is , that i have acted for an emigrant , and where is that emigrant ?
ah !
most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis , where is that emigrant ?
i cry in my sleep where is he ?
i demand of heaven , will he not come to deliver me ?
no answer .
ah monsieur heretofore the marquis , i send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris !
for the love of heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name , i supplicate you , monsieur heretofore the marquis , to succour and release me .
my fault is , that i have been true to you .
oh monsieur heretofore the marquis , i pray you be you true to me !
from this prison here of horror , whence i every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , i send you , monsieur heretofore the marquis , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service .
your afflicted , gabelle .
the latent uneasiness in darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter .
the peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in the temple considering what to do , he almost hid his face from the passersby .
he knew very well , that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his resentful suspicions of his uncle , and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold , he had acted imperfectly .
he knew very well , that in his love for lucie , his renunciation of his social place , though by no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete .
he knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it , and that he had meant to do it , and that it had never been done .
the happiness of his own chosen english home , the necessity of being always actively employed , the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast , that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week , and the events of the week following made all new again ; he knew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded :not without disquiet , but still without continuous and accumulating resistance .
that he had watched the times for a time of action , and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by , and the nobility were trooping from france by every highway and byway , and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction , and their very names were blotting out , was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in france that might impeach him for it .
but , he had oppressed no man , he had imprisoned no man ; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues , that he had relinquished them of his own will , thrown himself on a world with no favour in it , won his own private place there , and earned his own bread .
monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof , for his own safety , so that it could not but appear now .
this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make , that he would go to paris .
yes .
like the mariner in the old story , the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the loadstone rock , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go .
everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster and faster , more and more steadily , to the terrible attraction .
his latent uneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assert the claims of mercy and humanity .
with this uneasiness half stifled , and half reproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that comparison injurious to himself had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur , which had stung him bitterly , and those of stryver , which above all were coarse and galling , for old reasons .
upon those , had followed gabelle's letter : the appeal of an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and good name .
his resolution was made .
he must go to paris .
yes .
the loadstone rock was drawing him , and he must sail on , until he struck .
he knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger .
the intention with which he had done what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert it .
then , that glorious vision of doing good , which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds , arose before him , and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging revolution that was running so fearfully wild .
as he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone .
lucie should be spared the pain of separation ; and her father , always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as a step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt .
how much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father , through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind , he did not discuss with himself .
but , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course .
he walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to tellson's and take leave of mr. lorry .
as soon as he arrived in paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now .
a carriage with posthorses was ready at the bank door , and jerry was booted and equipped .
i have delivered that letter , said charles darnay to mr. lorry .
i would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a verbal one ?
that i will , and readily , said mr. lorry , if it is not dangerous .
not at all .
though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye .
what is his name ?
said mr. lorry , with his open pocketbook in his hand .
gabelle .
gabelle .
and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison ?
simply , 'that he has received the letter , and will come .
'any time mentioned ?
he will start upon his journey tomorrow night .
any person mentioned ?
no .
he helped mr. lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks , and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank , into the misty air of fleetstreet .
my love to lucie , and to little lucie , said mr. lorry at parting , and take precious care of them till i come back .
charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away .
that nightit was the fourteenth of augusthe sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the doctor , confiding lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances .
to both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival .
it was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind .
it was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious .
but , an affectionate glance at his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what impended he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid , and the day passed quickly .
early in the evening he embraced her , and her scarcely less dear namesake , pretending that he would return byandbye an imaginary engagement took him out , and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets , with a heavier heart .
the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it .
he left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for dover ; and began his journey .
for the love of heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name !
was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the loadstone rock .
the traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards paris from england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetytwo .
more than enough of bad roads , bad equipages , and bad horses , he would have encountered to delay him , though the fallen and unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory ; but , the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these .
every towngate and village taxinghouse had its band of citizenpatriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness , who stopped all comers and goers , crossquestioned them , inspected their papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning republic one and indivisible , of liberty , equality , fraternity , or death .
a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished , when charles darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at paris .
whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey's end .
not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and england .
the universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone .
this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage , but retarded his progress twenty times in a day , by riding after him and taking him back , riding before him and stopping him by anticipation , riding with him and keeping him in charge .
he had been days upon his journey in france alone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still a long way from paris .
nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelle's letter from his prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far .
his difficulty at the guardhouse in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis .
and he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night .
awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths , who sat down on the bed .
emigrant , said the functionary , i am going to send you on to paris , under an escort .
citizen , i desire nothing more than to get to paris , though i could dispense with the escort .
silence !
growled a redcap , striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his musket .
peace , aristocrat !
it is as the good patriot says , observed the timid functionary .
you are an aristocrat , and must have an escortand must pay for it .
i have no choice , said charles darnay .
choice !
listen to him !
cried the same scowling redcap .
as if it was not a favour to be protected from the lampiron !
it is always as the good patriot says , observed the functionary .
rise and dress yourself , emigrant .
darnay complied , and was taken back to the guardhouse , where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watchfire .
here he paid a heavy price for his escort , and hence he started with it on the wet , wet roads at three o'clock in the morning .
the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades , armed with national muskets and sabres , who rode one on either side of him .
the escorted governed his own horse , but a loose line was attached to his bridle , the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist .
in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces : clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon the miredeep roads .
in this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the miredeep leagues that lay between them and the capital .
they travelled in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lying by until the twilight fell .
the escort were so wretchedly clothed , that they twisted straw round their bare legs , and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off .
apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended , and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk , and carrying his musket very recklessly , charles darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and of representations , confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye , that were not yet made .
but when they came to the town of beauvaiswhich they did at eventide , when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming .
an ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the postingyard , and many voices called out loudly , down with the emigrant !
he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle , and , resuming it as his safest place , said : emigrant , my friends !
do you not see me here , in france , of my own will ?
you are a cursed emigrant , cried a farrier , making at him in a furious manner through the press , hammer in hand ; and you are a cursed aristocrat !
the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle at which he was evidently making , and soothingly said , let him be ; let him be !
he will be judged at paris .
judged !
repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer .
ay !
and condemned as a traitor .
at this the crowd roared approval .
checking the postmaster , who was for turning his horse's head to the yard the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on , with the line round his wrist , darnay said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : friends , you deceive yourselves , or you are deceived .
i am not a traitor .
he lies !
cried the smith .
he is a traitor since the decree .
his life is forfeit to the people .
his cursed life is not his own !
at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which another instant would have brought upon him , the postmaster turned his horse into the yard , the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks , and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates .
the farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer , and the crowd groaned ; but , no more was done .
what is this decree that the smith spoke of ?
darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard .
truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants .
when passed ?
on the fourteenth .
the day i left england !
everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be othersif there are not alreadybanishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return .
that is what he meant when he said your life was not your own .
but there are no such decrees yet ?
what do i know !
said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders ; there may be , or there will be .
it is all the same .
what would you have ?
they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep .
among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal , not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep .
after long and lonely spurring over dreary roads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty , or all drawn up together singing a liberty song .
happily , however , there was sleep in beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the untimely cold and wet , among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year , diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade , and sharp reining up across their way , of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads .
daylight at last found them before the wall of paris .
the barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it .
where are the papers of this prisoner ?
demanded a resolutelooking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard .
naturally struck by the disagreeable word , charles darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen , in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him , and which he had paid for .
where , repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , are the papers of this prisoner ?
the drunken patriot had them in his cap , and produced them .
casting his eyes over gabelle's letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise , and looked at darnay with a close attention .
he left escort and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into the guardroom ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate .
looking about him while in this state of suspense , charles darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumbering the former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , even for the homeliest people , was very difficult .
a numerous medley of men and women , not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts , was waiting to issue forth ; but , the previous identification was so strict , that they filtered through the barrier very slowly .
some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke , while others talked together , or loitered about .
the red cap and tricolour cockade were universal , both among men and women .
when he had sat in his saddle some halfhour , taking note of these things , darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier .
then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount .
he did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city .
he accompanied his conductor into a guardroom , smelling of common wine and tobacco , where certain soldiers and patriots , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking , drunkenness and sobriety , were standing and lying about .
the light in the guardhouse , half derived from the waning oillamps of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in a correspondingly uncertain condition .
some registers were lying open on a desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these .
citizen defarge , said he to darnay's conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on .
is this the emigrant evremonde ?
this is the man .
your age , evremonde ?
thirtyseven .
married , evremonde ?
yes .
where married ?
in england .
without doubt .
where is your wife , evremonde ?
in england .
without doubt .
you are consigned , evremonde , to the prison of la force .
just heaven !
exclaimed darnay .
under what law , and for what offence ?
the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment .
we have new laws , evremonde , and new offences , since you were here .
he said it with a hard smile , and went on writing .
i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily , in response to that written appeal of a fellowcountryman which lies before you .
i demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay .
is not that my right ?
emigrants have no rights , evremonde , was the stolid reply .
the officer wrote until he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , sanded it , and handed it to defarge , with the words in secret .
defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him .
the prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them .
is it you , said defarge , in a low voice , as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into paris , who married the daughter of doctor manette , once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more ?
yes , replied darnay , looking at him with surprise .
my name is defarge , and i keep a wineshop in the quarter saint antoine .
possibly you have heard of me .
my wife came to your house to reclaim her father ?
yes !
the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge , to say with sudden impatience , in the name of that sharp female newlyborn , and called la guillotine , why did you come to france ?
you heard me say why , a minute ago .
do you not believe it is the truth ?
a bad truth for you , said defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him .
indeed i am lost here .
all here is so unprecedented , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that i am absolutely lost .
will you render me a little help ?
none .
defarge spoke , always looking straight before him .
will you answer me a single question ?
perhaps .
according to its nature .
you can say what it is .
in this prison that i am going to so unjustly , shall i have some free communication with the world outside ?
you will see .
i am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presenting my case ?
you will see .
but , what then ?
other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons , before now .
but never by me , citizen defarge .
defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence .
the deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there wasor so darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree .
he , therefore , made haste to say : it is of the utmost importance to me you know , citizen , even better than i , of how much importance , that i should be able to communicate to mr. lorry of tellson's bank , an english gentleman who is now in paris , the simple fact , without comment , that i have been thrown into the prison of la force .
will you cause that to be done for me ?
i will do , defarge doggedly rejoined , nothing for you .
my duty is to my country and the people .
i am the sworn servant of both , against you .
i will do nothing for you .
charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides .
as they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets .
the very children scarcely noticed him .
a few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat ; otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work .
in one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family .
the few words that he caught from this man's lips , first made it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris .
on the road except at beauvais he had heard absolutely nothing .
the escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him .
that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left england , he of course knew now .
that perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now .
he could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days .
and yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear .
troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope .
the horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away .
the sharp female newlyborn , and called la guillotine , was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name .
the frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers .
how could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ?
of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly .
with this on his mind , which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard , he arrived at the prison of la force .
a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket , to whom defarge presented the emigrant evremonde .
what the devil !
how many more of them !
exclaimed the man with the bloated face .
defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , with his two fellowpatriots .
what the devil , i say again !
exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife .
how many more !
the gaoler's wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merely replied , one must have patience , my dear !
three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang , echoed the sentiment , and one added , for the love of liberty ; which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion .
the prison of la force was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it .
extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for !
in secret , too , grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper .
as if i was not already full to bursting !
he stuck the paper on a file , in an illhumour , and charles darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in the strong arched room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates .
come !
said the chief , at length taking up his keys , come with me , emigrant .
through the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase , many doors clanging and locking behind them , until they came into a large , low , vaulted chamber , crowded with prisoners of both sexes .
the women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs , or lingering up and down the room .
in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the newcomer recoiled from this company .
but the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life .
so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that charles darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead .
ghosts all !
the ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there .
it struck him motionless .
the gaoler standing at his side , and the other gaolers moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions , looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were therewith the apparitions of the coquette , the young beauty , and the mature woman delicately bredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented , was heightened to its utmost .
surely , ghosts all .
surely , the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades !
in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune , said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address , coming forward , i have the honour of giving you welcome to la force , and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us .
may it soon terminate happily !
it would be an impertinence elsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ?
charles darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find .
but i hope , said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , that you are not in secret ?
i do not understand the meaning of the term , but i have heard them say so .
ah , what a pity !
we so much regret it !
but take courage ; several members of our society have been in secret , at first , and it has lasted but a short time .
then he added , raising his voice , i grieve to inform the societyin secret .
there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voicesamong which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement .
he turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler's hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever .
the wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward .
when they had ascended forty steps the prisoner of half an hour already counted them , the gaoler opened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell .
it struck cold and damp , but was not dark .
yours , said the gaoler .
why am i confined alone ?
how do i know !
i can buy pen , ink , and paper ?
such are not my orders .
you will be visited , and can ask then .
at present , you may buy your food , and nothing more .
there were in the cell , a chair , a table , and a straw mattress .
as the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before going out , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him , that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated , both in face and person , as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water .
when the gaoler was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , now am i left , as if i were dead .
stopping then , to look down at the mattress , he turned from it with a sick feeling , and thought , and here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death .
five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half .
the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting its measurement , and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them .
he made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes .
the prisoner counted the measurement again , and paced faster , to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition .
the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed .
there was one among them , the appearance of a lady dressed in black , who was leaning in the embrasure of a window , and she had a light shining upon her golden hair , and she looked like     let us ride on again , for god's sake , through the illuminated villages with the people all awake !
    he made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes .
    five paces by four and a half .
with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind , the prisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and the roar of the city changed to this extentthat it still rolled in like muffled drums , but with the wail of voices that he knew , in the swell that rose above them .
tellson's bank , established in the saint germain quarter of paris , was in a wing of a large house , approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate .
the house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles , in his own cook's dress , and got across the borders .
a mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur , the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question .
monseigneur gone , and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and indivisible of liberty , equality , fraternity , or death , monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated , and then confiscated .
for , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumn month of september , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of monseigneur's house , and had marked it with the tricolour , and were drinking brandy in its state apartments .
a place of business in london like tellson's place of business in paris , would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette .
for , what would staid british responsibility and respectability have said to orangetrees in boxes in a bank courtyard , and even to a cupid over the counter ?
yet such things were .
tellson's had whitewashed the cupid , but he was still to be seen on the ceiling , in the coolest linen , aiming as he very often does at money from morning to night .
bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan , in lombardstreet , london , and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy , and also of a lookingglass let into the wall , and also of clerks not at all old , who danced in public on the slightest provocation .
yet , a french tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as the times held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out his money .
what money would be drawn out of tellson's henceforth , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would tarnish in tellson's hidingplaces , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should have violently perished ; how many accounts with tellson's never to be balanced in this world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , that night , any more than mr. jarvis lorry could , though he thought heavily of these questions .
he sat by a newlylighted wood fire the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror .
he occupied rooms in the bank , in his fidelity to the house of which he had grown to be a part , like strong rootivy .
it chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but the truehearted old gentleman never calculated about that .
all such circumstances were indifferent to him , so that he did his duty .
on the opposite side of the courtyard , under a colonnade , was extensive standingfor carriageswhere , indeed , some carriages of monseigneur yet stood .
against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux , and in the light of these , standing out in the open air , was a large grindstone : a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy , or other workshop .
rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects , mr. lorry shivered , and retired to his seat by the fire .
he had opened , not only the glass window , but the lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and he shivered through his frame .
from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate , there came the usual night hum of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , weird and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to heaven .
thank god , said mr. lorry , clasping his hands , that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town tonight .
may he have mercy on all who are in danger !
soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , they have come back !
and sat listening .
but , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet .
the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the bank , which a great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused .
it was well guarded , and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figures rushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement .
lucie and her father !
lucie with her arms stretched out to him , and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified , that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life .
what is this ?
cried mr. lorry , breathless and confused .
what is the matter ?
lucie !
manette !
what has happened ?
what has brought you here ?
what is it ?
with the look fixed upon him , in her paleness and wildness , she panted out in his arms , imploringly , o my dear friend !
my husband !
your husband , lucie ?
charles .
what of charles ?
here .
here , in paris ?
has been here some daysthree or fouri don't know how manyi can't collect my thoughts .
an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison .
the old man uttered an irrepressible cry .
almost at the same moment , the bell of the great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard .
what is that noise ?
said the doctor , turning towards the window .
don't look !
cried mr. lorry .
don't look out !
manette , for your life , don't touch the blind !
the doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : my dear friend , i have a charmed life in this city .
i have been a bastille prisoner .
there is no patriot in parisin paris ?
in francewho , knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm me with embraces , or carry me in triumph .
my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier , and gained us news of charles there , and brought us here .
i knew it would be so ; i knew i could help charles out of all danger ; i told lucie so .
whatis that noise ?
his hand was again upon the window .
don't look !
cried mr. lorry , absolutely desperate .
no , lucie , my dear , nor you !
he got his arm round her , and held her .
don't be so terrified , my love .
i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm having happened to charles ; that i had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place .
what prison is he in ?
la force !
la force !
lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in your lifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself now , to do exactly as i bid you ; for more depends upon it than you can think , or i can say .
there is no help for you in any action on your part tonight ; you cannot possibly stir out .
i say this , because what i must bid you to do for charles's sake , is the hardest thing to do of all .
you must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet .
you must let me put you in a room at the back here .
you must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are life and death in the world you must not delay .
i will be submissive to you .
i see in your face that you know i can do nothing else than this .
i know you are true .
the old man kissed her , and hurried her into his room , and turned the key ; then , came hurrying back to the doctor , and opened the window and partly opened the blind , and put his hand upon the doctor's arm , and looked out with him into the courtyard .
looked out upon a throng of men and women : not enough in number , or near enough , to fill the courtyard : not more than forty or fifty in all .
the people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate , and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone ; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose , as in a convenient and retired spot .
but , such awful workers , and such awful work !
the grindstone had a double handle , and , turning at it madly were two men , whose faces , as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up , were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise .
false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty , and all awry with howling , and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep .
as these ruffians turned and turned , their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes , now flung backward over their necks , some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink ; and what with dropping blood , and what with dropping wine , and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone , all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire .
the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood .
shouldering one another to get next at the sharpeningstone , were men stripped to the waist , with the stain all over their limbs and bodies ; men in all sorts of rags , with the stain upon those rags ; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon , with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through .
hatchets , knives , bayonets , swords , all brought to be sharpened , were all red with it .
some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them , with strips of linen and fragments of dress : ligatures various in kind , but all deep of the one colour .
and as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets , the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes ;eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life , to petrify with a welldirected gun .
all this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there .
they drew back from the window , and the doctor looked for explanation in his friend's ashy face .
they are , mr. lorry whispered the words , glancing fearfully round at the locked room , murdering the prisoners .
if you are sure of what you say ; if you really have the power you think you haveas i believe you havemake yourself known to these devils , and get taken to la force .
it may be too late , i don't know , but let it not be a minute later !
doctor manette pressed his hand , hastened bareheaded out of the room , and was in the courtyard when mr. lorry regained the blind .
his streaming white hair , his remarkable face , and the impetuous confidence of his manner , as he put the weapons aside like water , carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone .
for a few moments there was a pause , and a hurry , and a murmur , and the unintelligible sound of his voice ; and then mr. lorry saw him , surrounded by all , and in the midst of a line of twenty men long , all linked shoulder to shoulder , and hand to shoulder , hurried out with cries oflive the bastille prisoner !
help for the bastille prisoner's kindred in la force !
room for the bastille prisoner in front there !
save the prisoner evremonde at la force !
and a thousand answering shouts .
he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart , closed the window and the curtain , hastened to lucie , and told her that her father was assisted by the people , and gone in search of her husband .
he found her child and miss pross with her ; but , it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards , when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew .
lucie had , by that time , fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand .
miss pross had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge .
o the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife !
and o the long , long night , with no return of her father and no tidings !
twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded , and the irruption was repeated , and the grindstone whirled and spluttered .
what is it ?
cried lucie , affrighted .
hush !
the soldiers' swords are sharpened there , said mr. lorry .
the place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love .
twice more in all ; but , the last spell of work was feeble and fitful .
soon afterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again .
a man , so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain , was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone , and looking about him with a vacant air .
shortly , this wornout murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of monseigneur , and , staggering to that gorgeous vehicle , climbed in at the door , and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions .
the great grindstone , earth , had turned when mr. lorry looked out again , and the sun was red on the courtyard .
but , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away .
one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr. lorry when business hours came round , was this :that he had no right to imperil tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the bank roof .
his own possessions , safety , life , he would have hazarded for lucie and her child , without a moment's demur ; but the great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business .
at first , his mind reverted to defarge , and he thought of finding out the wineshop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwellingplace in the distracted state of the city .
but , the same consideration that suggested him , repudiated him ; he lived in the most violent quarter , and doubtless was influential there , and deep in its dangerous workings .
noon coming , and the doctor not returning , and every minute's delay tending to compromise tellson's , mr. lorry advised with lucie .
she said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term , in that quarter , near the bankinghouse .
as there was no business objection to this , and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles , and he were to be released , he could not hope to leave the city , mr. lorry went out in quest of such a lodging , and found a suitable one , high up in a removed bystreet where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes .
to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child , and miss pross : giving them what comfort he could , and much more than he had himself .
he left jerry with them , as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head , and returned to his own occupations .
a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them , and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him .
it wore itself out , and wore him out with it , until the bank closed .
he was again alone in his room of the previous night , considering what to do next , when he heard a foot upon the stair .
in a few moments , a man stood in his presence , who , with a keenly observant look at him , addressed him by his name .
your servant , said mr. lorry .
do you know me ?
he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair , from fortyfive to fifty years of age .
for answer he repeated , without any change of emphasis , the words : do you know me ?
i have seen you somewhere .
perhaps at my wineshop ?
much interested and agitated , mr. lorry said : you come from doctor manette ?
yes .
i come from doctor manette .
and what says he ?
what does he send me ?
defarge gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper .
it bore the words in the doctor's writing : charles is safe , but i cannot safely leave this place yet .
i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from charles to his wife .
let the bearer see his wife .
it was dated from la force , within an hour .
will you accompany me , said mr. lorry , joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud , to where his wife resides ?
yes , returned defarge .
scarcely noticing as yet , in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way defarge spoke , mr. lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard .
there , they found two women ; one , knitting .
madame defarge , surely !
said mr. lorry , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago .
it is she , observed her husband .
does madame go with us ?
inquired mr. lorry , seeing that she moved as they moved .
yes .
that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons .
it is for their safety .
beginning to be struck by defarge's manner , mr. lorry looked dubiously at him , and led the way .
both the women followed ; the second woman being the vengeance .
they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascended the staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by jerry , and found lucie weeping , alone .
she was thrown into a transport by the tidings mr. lorry gave her of her husband , and clasped the hand that delivered his notelittle thinking what it had been doing near him in the night , and might , but for a chance , have done to him .
dearest ,take courage .
i am well , and your father has influence around me .
you cannot answer this .
kiss our child for me .
that was all the writing .
it was so much , however , to her who received it , that she turned from defarge to his wife , and kissed one of the hands that knitted .
it was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no responsedropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again .
there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check .
she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at madame defarge .
madame defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare .
my dear , said mr. lorry , striking in to explain ; there are frequent risings in the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times , to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them .
i believe , said mr. lorry , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , i state the case , citizen defarge ?
defarge looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence .
you had better , lucie , said mr. lorry , doing all he could to propitiate , by tone and manner , have the dear child here , and our good pross .
our good pross , defarge , is an english lady , and knows no french .
the lady in question , whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner , was not to be shaken by distress and , danger , appeared with folded arms , and observed in english to the vengeance , whom her eyes first encountered , well , i am sure , boldface !
i hope you are pretty well !
she also bestowed a british cough on madame defarge ; but , neither of the two took much heed of her .
is that his child ?
said madame defarge , stopping in her work for the first time , and pointing her knittingneedle at little lucie as if it were the finger of fate .
yes , madame , answered mr. lorry ; this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter , and only child .
the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast .
the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both the mother and the child .
it is enough , my husband , said madame defarge .
i have seen them .
we may go .
but , the suppressed manner had enough of menace in itnot visible and presented , but indistinct and withheldto alarm lucie into saying , as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge's dress : you will be good to my poor husband .
you will do him no harm .
you will help me to see him if you can ?
your husband is not my business here , returned madame defarge , looking down at her with perfect composure .
it is the daughter of your father who is my business here .
for my sake , then , be merciful to my husband .
for my child's sake !
she will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful .
we are more afraid of you than of these others .
madame defarge received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband .
defarge , who had been uneasily biting his thumbnail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression .
what is it that your husband says in that little letter ?
asked madame defarge , with a lowering smile .
influence ; he says something touching influence ?
that my father , said lucie , hurriedly taking the paper from her breast , but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it , has much influence around him .
surely it will release him !
said madame defarge .
let it do so .
as a wife and mother , cried lucie , most earnestly , i implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess , against my innocent husband , but to use it in his behalf .
o sisterwoman , think of me .
as a wife and mother !
madame defarge looked , coldly as ever , at the suppliant , and said , turning to her friend the vengeance : the wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little as this child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ?
we have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ?
all our lives , we have seen our sisterwomen suffer , in themselves and in their children , poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression and neglect of all kinds ?
we have seen nothing else , returned the vengeance .
we have borne this a long time , said madame defarge , turning her eyes again upon lucie .
judge you !
is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now ?
she resumed her knitting and went out .
the vengeance followed .
defarge went last , and closed the door .
courage , my dear lucie , said mr. lorry , as he raised her .
courage , courage !
so far all goes well with usmuch , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls .
cheer up , and have a thankful heart .
i am not thankless , i hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes .
tut , tut !
said mr. lorry ; what is this despondency in the brave little breast ?
a shadow indeed !
no substance in it , lucie .
but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly .
doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence .
so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her , that not until long afterwards , when france and she were far apart , did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace ; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror ; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain .
she only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons , that all political prisoners had been in danger , and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered .
to mr. lorry , the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell , that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of la force .
that , in the prison he had found a selfappointed tribunal sitting , before which the prisoners were brought singly , and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred , or to be released , or in a few cases to be sent back to their cells .
that , presented by his conductors to this tribunal , he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him , and that this man was defarge .
that , hereupon he had ascertained , through the registers on the table , that his soninlaw was among the living prisoners , and had pleaded hard to the tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murder and some clean , some sober and some notfor his life and liberty .
that , in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system , it had been accorded to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court , and examined .
that , he seemed on the point of being at once released , when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check not intelligible to the doctor , which led to a few words of secret conference .
that , the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that the prisoner must remain in custody , but should , for his sake , be held inviolate in safe custody .
that , immediately , on a signal , the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again ; but , that he , the doctor , had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his soninlaw was , through no malice or mischance , delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings , that he had obtained the permission , and had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over .
the sights he had seen there , with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals , shall remain untold .
the mad joy over the prisoners who were saved , had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces .
one prisoner there was , he said , who had been discharged into the street free , but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out .
being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the doctor had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of samaritans , who were seated on the bodies of their victims .
with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare , they had helped the healer , and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful , that the doctor had covered his eyes with his hands , and swooned away in the midst of it .
as mr. lorry received these confidences , and as he watched the face of his friend now sixtytwo years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger .
but , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character .
for the first time the doctor felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power .
for the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter's husband , and deliver him .
it all tended to a good end , my friend ; it was not mere waste and ruin .
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself , i will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her ; by the aid of heaven i will do it !
thus , doctor manette .
and when jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes , the resolute face , the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like a clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness , he believed .
greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his persevering purpose .
while he kept himself in his place , as a physician , whose business was with all degrees of mankind , bond and free , rich and poor , bad and good , he used his personal influence so wisely , that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons , and among them of la force .
he could now assure lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone , but was mixed with the general body of prisoners ; he saw her husband weekly , and brought sweet messages to her , straight from his lips ; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her though never by the doctor's hand , but she was not permitted to write to him : for , among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons , the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad .
this new life of the doctor's was an anxious life , no doubt ; still , the sagacious mr. lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it .
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride ; it was a natural and worthy one ; but he observed it as a curiosity .
the doctor knew , that up to that time , his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend , with his personal affliction , deprivation , and weakness .
now that this was changed , and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charles's ultimate safety and deliverance , he became so far exalted by the change , that he took the lead and direction , and required them as the weak , to trust to him as the strong .
the preceding relative positions of himself and lucie were reversed , yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them , for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him .
all curious to see , thought mr. lorry , in his amiably shrewd way , but all natural and right ; so , take the lead , my dear friend , and keep it ; it couldn't be in better hands .
but , though the doctor tried hard , and never ceased trying , to get charles darnay set at liberty , or at least to get him brought to trial , the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him .
the new era began ; the king was tried , doomed , and beheaded ; the republic of liberty , equality , fraternity , or death , declared for victory or death against the world in arms ; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of notre dame ; three hundred thousand men , summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth , rose from all the varying soils of france , as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast , and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain , on rock , in gravel , and alluvial mud , under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of the north , in fell and forest , in the vineyards and the olivegrounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn , along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers , and in the sand of the seashore .
what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year one of libertythe deluge rising from below , not falling from above , and with the windows of heaven shut , not opened !
there was no pause , no pity , no peace , no interval of relenting rest , no measurement of time .
though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young , and the evening and morning were the first day , other count of time there was none .
hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation , as it is in the fever of one patient .
now , breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city , the executioner showed the people the head of the kingand now , it seemed almost in the same breath , the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery , to turn it grey .
and yet , observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases , the time was long , while it flamed by so fast .
a revolutionary tribunal in the capital , and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land ; a law of the suspected , which struck away all security for liberty or life , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain no hearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things , and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old .
above all , one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the worldthe figure of the sharp female called la guillotine .
it was the popular theme for jests ; it was the best cure for headache , it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey , it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion , it was the national razor which shaved close : who kissed la guillotine , looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack .
it was the sign of the regeneration of the human race .
it superseded the cross .
models of it were worn on breasts from which the cross was discarded , and it was bowed down to and believed in where the cross was denied .
it sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red .
it was taken to pieces , like a toypuzzle for a young devil , and was put together again when the occasion wanted it .
it hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good .
twentytwo friends of high public mark , twentyone living and one dead , it had lopped the heads off , in one morning , in as many minutes .
the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it ; but , so armed , he was stronger than his namesake , and blinder , and tore away the gates of god's own temple every day .
among these terrors , and the brood belonging to them , the doctor walked with a steady head : confident in his power , cautiously persistent in his end , never doubting that he would save lucie's husband at last .
yet the current of the time swept by , so strong and deep , and carried the time away so fiercely , that charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the doctor was thus steady and confident .
so much more wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month , that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night , and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun .
still , the doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head .
no man better known than he , in paris at that day ; no man in a stranger situation .
silent , humane , indispensable in hospital and prison , using his art equally among assassins and victims , he was a man apart .
in the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all other men .
he was not suspected or brought in question , any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before , or were a spirit moving among mortals .
one year and three months .
during all that time lucie was never sure , from hour to hour , but that the guillotine would strike off her husband's head next day .
every day , through the stony streets , the tumbrils now jolted heavily , filled with condemned .
lovely girls ; bright women , brownhaired , blackhaired , and grey ; youths ; stalwart men and old ; gentle born and peasant born ; all red wine for la guillotine , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons , and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst .
liberty , equality , fraternity , or death ;the last , much the easiest to bestow , o guillotine !
if the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , had stunned the doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it would but have been with her as it was with many .
but , from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of saint antoine , she had been true to her duties .
she was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be .
as soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there .
everything had its appointed place and its appointed time .
little lucie she taught , as regularly , as if they had all been united in their english home .
the slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunitedthe little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his booksthese , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of deathwere almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind .
she did not greatly alter in appearance .
the plain dark dresses , akin to mourning dresses , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days .
she lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely .
sometimes , at night on kissing her father , she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day , and would say that her sole reliance , under heaven , was on him .
he always resolutely answered : nothing can happen to him without my knowledge , and i know that i can save him , lucie .
they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks , when her father said to her , on coming home one evening : my dear , there is an upper window in the prison , to which charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon .
when he can get to itwhich depends on many uncertainties and incidentshe might see you in the street , he thinks , if you stood in a certain place that i can show you .
but you will not be able to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition .
o show me the place , my father , and i will go there every day .
from that time , in all weathers , she waited there two hours .
as the clock struck two , she was there , and at four she turned resignedly away .
when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day .
it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street .
the hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning , was the only house at that end ; all else was wall .
on the third day of her being there , he noticed her .
good day , citizeness .
good day , citizen .
this mode of address was now prescribed by decree .
it had been established voluntarily some time ago , among the more thorough patriots ; but , was now law for everybody .
walking here again , citizeness ?
you see me , citizen !
the woodsawyer , who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture he had once been a mender of roads , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at the prison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars , peeped through them jocosely .
but it's not my business , said he .
and went on sawing his wood .
next day he was looking out for her , and accosted her the moment she appeared .
what ?
walking here again , citizeness ?
yes , citizen .
ah !
a child too !
your mother , is it not , my little citizeness ?
do i say yes , mamma ?
whispered little lucie , drawing close to her .
yes , dearest .
yes , citizen .
ah !
but it's not my business .
my work is my business .
see my saw !
i call it my little guillotine .
la , la , la ; la , la , la !
and off his head comes !
the billet fell as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket .
i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine .
see here again !
loo , loo , loo ; loo , loo , loo !
and off her head comes !
now , a child .
tickle , tickle ; pickle , pickle !
and off its head comes .
all the family !
lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the woodsawyer was at work , and not be in his sight .
thenceforth , to secure his good will , she always spoke to him first , and often gave him drinkmoney , which he readily received .
he was an inquisitive fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates , and in lifting her heart up to her husband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work .
but it's not my business !
he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again .
in all weathers , in the snow and frost of winter , in the bitter winds of spring , in the hot sunshine of summer , in the rains of autumn , and again in the snow and frost of winter , lucie passed two hours of every day at this place ; and every day on leaving it , she kissed the prison wall .
her husband saw her so she learned from her father it might be once in five or six times : it might be twice or thrice running : it might be , not for a week or a fortnight together .
it was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served , and on that possibility she would have waited out the day , seven days a week .
these occupations brought her round to the december month , wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head .
on a lightlysnowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner .
it was a day of some wild rejoicing , and a festival .
she had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with little pikes , and with little red caps stuck upon them ; also , with tricoloured ribbons ; also , with the standard inscription tricoloured letters were the favourite , republic one and indivisible .
liberty , equality , fraternity , or death !
the miserable shop of the woodsawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend .
he had got somebody to scrawl it up for him , however , who had squeezed death in with most inappropriate difficulty .
on his housetop , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his little sainte guillotinefor the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised .
his shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to lucie , and left her quite alone .
but , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear .
a moment afterwards , and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall , in the midst of whom was the woodsawyer hand in hand with the vengeance .
there could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons .
there was no other music than their own singing .
they danced to the popular revolution song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison .
men and women danced together , women danced together , men danced together , as hazard had brought them together .
at first , they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags ; but , as they filled the place , and stopped to dance about lucie , some ghastly apparition of a dancefigure gone raving mad arose among them .
they advanced , retreated , struck at one another's hands , clutched at one another's heads , spun round alone , caught one another and spun round in pairs , until many of them dropped .
while those were down , the rest linked hand in hand , and all spun round together : then the ring broke , and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once , began again , struck , clutched , and tore , and then reversed the spin , and all spun round another way .
suddenly they stopped again , paused , struck out the time afresh , formed into lines the width of the public way , and , with their heads low down and their hands high up , swooped screaming off .
no fight could have been half so terrible as this dance .
it was so emphatically a fallen sporta something , once innocent , delivered over to all devilrya healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , and steeling the heart .
such grace as was visible in it , made it the uglier , showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become .
the maidenly bosom bared to this , the pretty almostchild's head thus distracted , the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt , were types of the disjointed time .
this was the carmagnole .
as it passed , leaving lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the woodsawyer's house , the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft , as if it had never been .
o my father !
for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand ; such a cruel , bad sight .
i know , my dear , i know .
i have seen it many times .
don't be frightened !
not one of them would harm you .
i am not frightened for myself , my father .
but when i think of my husband , and the mercies of these people we will set him above their mercies very soon .
i left him climbing to the window , and i came to tell you .
there is no one here to see .
you may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof .
i do so , father , and i send him my soul with it !
you cannot see him , my poor dear ?
no , father , said lucie , yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand , no .
a footstep in the snow .
madame defarge .
i salute you , citizeness , from the doctor .
i salute you , citizen .
this in passing .
nothing more .
madame defarge gone , like a shadow over the white road .
give me your arm , my love .
pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake .
that was well done ; they had left the spot ; it shall not be in vain .
charles is summoned for tomorrow .
for tomorrow !
there is no time to lose .
i am well prepared , but there are precautions to be taken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the tribunal .
he has not received the notice yet , but i know that he will presently be summoned for tomorrow , and removed to the conciergerie ; i have timely information .
you are not afraid ?
she could scarcely answer , i trust in you .
do so , implicitly .
your suspense is nearly ended , my darling ; he shall be restored to you within a few hours ; i have encompassed him with every protection .
i must see lorry .
he stopped .
there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing .
they both knew too well what it meant .
one .
two .
three .
three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow .
i must see lorry , the doctor repeated , turning her another way .
the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it .
he and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national .
what he could save for the owners , he saved .
no better man living to hold fast by what tellson's had in keeping , and to hold his peace .
a murky red and yellow sky , and a rising mist from the seine , denoted the approach of darkness .
it was almost dark when they arrived at the bank .
the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted .
above a heap of dust and ashes in the court , ran the letters : national property .
republic one and indivisible .
liberty , equality , fraternity , or death !
who could that be with mr. lorrythe owner of the ridingcoat upon the chairwho must not be seen ?
from whom newly arrived , did he come out , agitated and surprised , to take his favourite in his arms ?
to whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued , he said : removed to the conciergerie , and summoned for tomorrow ?
the dread tribunal of five judges , public prosecutor , and determined jury , sat every day .
their lists went forth every evening , and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners .
the standard gaolerjoke was , come out and listen to the evening paper , you inside there !
charles evremonde , called darnay !
so at last began the evening paper at la force .
when a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded .
charles evremonde , called darnay , had reason to know the usage ; he had seen hundreds pass away so .
his bloated gaoler , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the list , making a similar short pause at each name .
there were twentythree names , but only twenty were responded to ; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten , and two had already been guillotined and forgotten .
the list was read , in the vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival .
every one of those had perished in the massacre ; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with , had died on the scaffold .
there were hurried words of farewell and kindness , but the parting was soon over .
it was the incident of every day , and the society of la force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert , for that evening .
they crowded to the grates and shed tears there ; but , twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled , and the time was , at best , short to the lockup hour , when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night .
the prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling ; their ways arose out of the condition of the time .
similarly , though with a subtle difference , a species of fervour or intoxication , known , without doubt , to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily , and to die by it , was not mere boastfulness , but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind .
in seasons of pestilence , some of us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea terrible passing inclination to die of it .
and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts , only needing circumstances to evoke them .
the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark ; the night in its verminhaunted cells was long and cold .
next day , fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnay's name was called .
all the fifteen were condemned , and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half .
charles evremonde , called darnay , was at length arraigned .
his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats ; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the headdress otherwise prevailing .
looking at the jury and the turbulent audience , he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed , and that the felons were trying the honest men .
the lowest , cruelest , and worst populace of a city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily commenting , applauding , disapproving , anticipating , and precipitating the result , without a check .
of the men , the greater part were armed in various ways ; of the women , some wore knives , some daggers , some ate and drank as they looked on , many knitted .
among these last , was one , with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked .
she was in a front row , by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier , but whom he directly remembered as defarge .
he noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear , and that she seemed to be his wife ; but , what he most noticed in the two figures was , that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be , they never looked towards him .
they seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination , and they looked at the jury , but at nothing else .
under the president sat doctor manette , in his usual quiet dress .
as well as the prisoner could see , he and mr. lorry were the only men there , unconnected with the tribunal , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed the coarse garb of the carmagnole .
charles evremonde , called darnay , was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant , whose life was forfeit to the republic , under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death .
it was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to france .
there he was , and there was the decree ; he had been taken in france , and his head was demanded .
take off his head !
cried the audience .
an enemy to the republic !
the president rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in england ?
undoubtedly it was .
was he not an emigrant then ?
what did he call himself ?
not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law .
why not ?
the president desired to know .
because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him , and a station that was distasteful to him , and had left his countryhe submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the tribunal was in useto live by his own industry in england , rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france .
what proof had he of this ?
he handed in the names of two witnesses ; theophile gabelle , and alexandre manette .
but he had married in england ?
the president reminded him .
true , but not an english woman .
a citizeness of france ?
yes .
by birth .
her name and family ?
lucie manette , only daughter of doctor manette , the good physician who sits there .
this answer had a happy effect upon the audience .
cries in exaltation of the wellknown good physician rent the hall .
so capriciously were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before , as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him .
on these few steps of his dangerous way , charles darnay had set his foot according to doctor manette's reiterated instructions .
the same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him , and had prepared every inch of his road .
the president asked , why had he returned to france when he did , and not sooner ?
he had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in france , save those he had resigned ; whereas , in england , he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature .
he had returned when he did , on the pressing and written entreaty of a french citizen , who represented that his life was endangered by his absence .
he had come back , to save a citizen's life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth .
was that criminal in the eyes of the republic ?
the populace cried enthusiastically , no !
and the president rang his bell to quiet them .
which it did not , for they continued to cry no !
until they left off , of their own will .
the president required the name of that citizen .
the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness .
he also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter , which had been taken from him at the barrier , but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the president .
the doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that it would be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read .
citizen gabelle was called to confirm it , and did so .
citizen gabelle hinted , with infinite delicacy and politeness , that in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal , he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbayein fact , had rather passed out of the tribunal's patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago ; when he had been summoned before it , and had been set at liberty on the jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered , as to himself , by the surrender of the citizen evremonde , called darnay .
doctor manette was next questioned .
his high personal popularity , and the clearness of his answers , made a great impression ; but , as he proceeded , as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment ; that , the accused had remained in england , always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile ; that , so far from being in favour with the aristocrat government there , he had actually been tried for his life by it , as the foe of england and friend of the united statesas he brought these circumstances into view , with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness , the jury and the populace became one .
at last , when he appealed by name to monsieur lorry , an english gentleman then and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his account of it , the jury declared that they had heard enough , and that they were ready with their votes if the president were content to receive them .
at every vote the jurymen voted aloud and individually , the populace set up a shout of applause .
all the voices were in the prisoner's favour , and the president declared him free .
then , began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness , or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy , or which they regarded as some setoff against their swollen account of cruel rage .
no man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable ; it is probable , to a blending of all the three , with the second predominating .
no sooner was the acquittal pronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at him with the very same intensity , to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets .
his removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment .
five were to be tried together , next , as enemies of the republic , forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed .
so quick was the tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost , that these five came down to him before he left the place , condemned to die within twentyfour hours .
the first of them told him so , with the customary prison sign of deatha raised fingerand they all added in words , long live the republic !
the five had had , it is true , no audience to lengthen their proceedings , for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate , there was a great crowd about it , in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in courtexcept two , for which he looked in vain .
on his coming out , the concourse made at him anew , weeping , embracing , and shouting , all by turns and all together , until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted , seemed to run mad , like the people on the shore .
they put him into a great chair they had among them , and which they had taken either out of the court itself , or one of its rooms or passages .
over the chair they had thrown a red flag , and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top .
in this car of triumph , not even the doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders , with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him , and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces , that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion , and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine .
in wild dreamlike procession , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on .
reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing republican colour , in winding and tramping through them , as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye , they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived .
her father had gone on before , to prepare her , and when her husband stood upon his feet , she dropped insensible in his arms .
as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd , so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen , a few of the people fell to dancing .
instantly , all the rest fell to dancing , and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole .
then , they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty , and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets , and along the river's bank , and over the bridge , the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away .
after grasping the doctor's hand , as he stood victorious and proud before him ; after grasping the hand of mr. lorry , who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole ; after kissing little lucie , who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck ; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who lifted her ; he took his wife in his arms , and carried her up to their rooms .
lucie !
my own !
i am safe .
o dearest charles , let me thank god for this on my knees as i have prayed to him .
they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts .
when she was again in his arms , he said to her : and now speak to your father , dearest .
no other man in all this france could have done what he has done for me .
she laid her head upon her father's breast , as she had laid his poor head on her own breast , long , long ago .
he was happy in the return he had made her , he was recompensed for his suffering , he was proud of his strength .
you must not be weak , my darling , he remonstrated ; don't tremble so .
i have saved him .
i have saved him .
it was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back ; he was really here .
and yet his wife trembled , and a vague but heavy fear was upon her .
all the air round was so thick and dark , the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful , the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice , it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her , every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched , that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be .
the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall , and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets .
her mind pursued them , looking for him among the condemned ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more .
her father , cheering her , showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness , which was wonderful to see .
no garret , no shoemaking , no one hundred and five , north tower , now !
he had accomplished the task he had set himself , his promise was redeemed , he had saved charles .
let them all lean upon him .
their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind : not only because that was the safest way of life , involving the least offence to the people , but because they were not rich , and charles , throughout his imprisonment , had had to pay heavily for his bad food , and for his guard , and towards the living of the poorer prisoners .
partly on this account , and partly to avoid a domestic spy , they kept no servant ; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate , rendered them occasional service ; and jerry almost wholly transferred to them by mr. lorry had become their daily retainer , and had his bed there every night .
it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty , equality , fraternity , or death , that on the door or doorpost of every house , the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size , at a certain convenient height from the ground .
mr. jerry cruncher's name , therefore , duly embellished the doorpost down below ; and , as the afternoon shadows deepened , the owner of that name himself appeared , from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde , called darnay .
in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time , all the usual harmless ways of life were changed .
in the doctor's little household , as in very many others , the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening , in small quantities and at various small shops .
to avoid attracting notice , and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy , was the general desire .
for some months past , miss pross and mr. cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors ; the former carrying the money ; the latter , the basket .
every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forth on this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful .
although miss pross , through her long association with a french family , might have known as much of their language as of her own , if she had had a mind , she had no mind in that direction ; consequently she knew no more of that nonsense as she was pleased to call it than mr. cruncher did .
so her manner of marketing was to plump a nounsubstantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded .
she always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be .
now , mr. cruncher , said miss pross , whose eyes were red with felicity ; if you are ready , i am .
jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss pross's service .
he had worn all his rust off long ago , but nothing would file his spiky head down .
there's all manner of things wanted , said miss pross , and we shall have a precious time of it .
we want wine , among the rest .
nice toasts these redheads will be drinking , wherever we buy it .
it will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , i should think , retorted jerry , whether they drink your health or the old un's .
who's he ?
said miss pross .
mr. cruncher , with some diffidence , explained himself as meaning old nick's .
ha !
said miss pross , it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures .
they have but one , and it's midnight murder , and mischief .
hush , dear !
pray , pray , be cautious !
cried lucie .
yes , yes , yes , i'll be cautious , said miss pross ; but i may say among ourselves , that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round , going on in the streets .
now , ladybird , never you stir from that fire till i come back !
take care of the dear husband you have recovered , and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now , till you see me again !
may i ask a question , doctor manette , before i go ?
i think you may take that liberty , the doctor answered , smiling .
for gracious sake , don't talk about liberty ; we have quite enough of that , said miss pross .
hush , dear !
again ?
lucie remonstrated .
well , my sweet , said miss pross , nodding her head emphatically , the short and the long of it is , that i am a subject of his most gracious majesty king george the third ; miss pross curtseyed at the name ; and as such , my maxim is , confound their politics , frustrate their knavish tricks , on him our hopes we fix , god save the king !
mr. cruncher , in an access of loyalty , growlingly repeated the words after miss pross , like somebody at church .
i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you , though i wish you had never taken that cold in your voice , said miss pross , approvingly .
but the question , doctor manette .
is thereit was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all , and to come at it in this chance manneris there any prospect yet , of our getting out of this place ?
i fear not yet .
it would be dangerous for charles yet .
heighhohum !
said miss pross , cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire , then we must have patience and wait : that's all .
we must hold up our heads and fight low , as my brother solomon used to say .
now , mr. cruncher !
don'tyou move , ladybird !
they went out , leaving lucie , and her husband , her father , and the child , by a bright fire .
mr. lorry was expected back presently from the banking house .
miss pross had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they might enjoy the firelight undisturbed .
little lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm : and he , in a tone not rising much above a whisper , began to tell her a story of a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prisonwall and let out a captive who had once done the fairy a service .
all was subdued and quiet , and lucie was more at ease than she had been .
what is that ?
she cried , all at once .
my dear !
said her father , stopping in his story , and laying his hand on hers , command yourself .
what a disordered state you are in !
the least thingnothingstartles you !
you , your father's daughter !
i thought , my father , said lucie , excusing herself , with a pale face and in a faltering voice , that i heard strange feet upon the stairs .
my love , the staircase is as still as death .
as he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door .
oh father , father .
what can this be !
hide charles .
save him !
my child , said the doctor , rising , and laying his hand upon her shoulder , i have saved him .
what weakness is this , my dear !
let me go to the door .
he took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it .
a rude clattering of feet over the floor , and four rough men in red caps , armed with sabres and pistols , entered the room .
the citizen evremonde , called darnay , said the first .
who seeks him ?
answered darnay .
i seek him .
we seek him .
i know you , evremonde ; i saw you before the tribunal today .
you are again the prisoner of the republic .
the four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him .
tell me how and why am i again a prisoner ?
it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie , and will know tomorrow .
you are summoned for tomorrow .
doctor manette , whom this visitation had so turned into stone , that he stood with the lamp in his hand , as if he were a statue made to hold it , moved after these words were spoken , put the lamp down , and confronting the speaker , and taking him , not ungently , by the loose front of his red woollen shirt , said : you know him , you have said .
do you know me ?
yes , i know you , citizen doctor .
we all know you , citizen doctor , said the other three .
he looked abstractedly from one to another , and said , in a lower voice , after a pause : will you answer his question to me then ?
how does this happen ?
citizen doctor , said the first , reluctantly , he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine .
this citizen , pointing out the second who had entered , is from saint antoine .
the citizen here indicated nodded his head , and added : he is accused by saint antoine .
of what ?
asked the doctor .
citizen doctor , said the first , with his former reluctance , ask no more .
if the republic demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them .
the republic goes before all .
the people is supreme .
evremonde , we are pressed .
one word , the doctor entreated .
will you tell me who denounced him ?
it is against rule , answered the first ; but you can ask him of saint antoine here .
the doctor turned his eyes upon that man .
who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : well !
truly it is against rule .
but he is denouncedand gravelyby the citizen and citizeness defarge .
and by one other .
what other ?
do you ask , citizen doctor ?
yes .
then , said he of saint antoine , with a strange look , you will be answered tomorrow .
now , i am dumb !
happily unconscious of the new calamity at home , miss pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pontneuf , reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make .
mr. cruncher , with the basket , walked at her side .
they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed , had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people , and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers .
it was a raw evening , and the misty river , blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked , making guns for the army of the republic .
woe to the man who played tricks with that army , or got undeserved promotion in it !
better for him that his beard had never grown , for the national razor shaved him close .
having purchased a few small articles of grocery , and a measure of oil for the lamp , miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted .
after peeping into several wineshops , she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity , not far from the national palace , once and twice the tuileries , where the aspect of things rather took her fancy .
it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed , and , though red with patriotic caps , was not so red as the rest .
sounding mr. cruncher , and finding him of her opinion , miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity , attended by her cavalier .
slightly observant of the smoky lights ; of the people , pipe in mouth , playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes ; of the one barebreasted , barearmed , sootbegrimed workman reading a journal aloud , and of the others listening to him ; of the weapons worn , or laid aside to be resumed ; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep , who in the popular highshouldered shaggy black spencer looked , in that attitude , like slumbering bears or dogs ; the two outlandish customers approached the counter , and showed what they wanted .
as their wine was measuring out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart .
in going , he had to face miss pross .
no sooner did he face her , than miss pross uttered a scream , and clapped her hands .
in a moment , the whole company were on their feet .
that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence .
everybody looked to see somebody fall , but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other ; the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican ; the woman , evidently english .
what was said in this disappointing anticlimax , by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity , except that it was something very voluble and loud , would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss pross and her protector , though they had been all ears .
but , they had no ears for anything in their surprise .
for , it must be recorded , that not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation , but , mr. cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate and individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder .
what is the matter ?
said the man who had caused miss pross to scream ; speaking in a vexed , abrupt voice though in a low tone , and in english .
oh , solomon , dear solomon !
cried miss pross , clapping her hands again .
after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do i find you here !
don't call me solomon .
do you want to be the death of me ?
asked the man , in a furtive , frightened way .
brother , brother !
cried miss pross , bursting into tears .
have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question ?
then hold your meddlesome tongue , said solomon , and come out , if you want to speak to me .
pay for your wine , and come out .
who's this man ?
miss pross , shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother , said through her tears , mr .
cruncher .
let him come out too , said solomon .
does he think me a ghost ?
apparently , mr. cruncher did , to judge from his looks .
he said not a word , however , and miss pross , exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine .
as she did so , solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity , and offered a few words of explanation in the french language , which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits .
now , said solomon , stopping at the dark street corner , what do you want ?
how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from !
cried miss pross , to give me such a greeting , and show me no affection .
there .
confound it !
there , said solomon , making a dab at miss pross's lips with his own .
now are you content ?
miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence .
if you expect me to be surprised , said her brother solomon , i am not surprised ; i knew you were here ; i know of most people who are here .
if you really don't want to endanger my existencewhich i half believe you dogo your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine .
i am busy .
i am an official .
my english brother solomon , mourned miss pross , casting up her tearfraught eyes , that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country , an official among foreigners , and such foreigners !
i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his i said so !
cried her brother , interrupting .
i knew it .
you want to be the death of me .
i shall be rendered suspected , by my own sister .
just as i am getting on !
the gracious and merciful heavens forbid !
cried miss pross .
far rather would i never see you again , dear solomon , though i have ever loved you truly , and ever shall .
say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us , and i will detain you no longer .
good miss pross !
as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers .
as if mr. lorry had not known it for a fact , years ago , in the quiet corner in soho , that this precious brother had spent her money and left her !
he was saying the affectionate word , however , with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case , all the world over , when mr. cruncher , touching him on the shoulder , hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question : i say !
might i ask the favour ?
as to whether your name is john solomon , or solomon john ?
the official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
he had not previously uttered a word .
come !
said mr. cruncher .
speak out , you know .
which , by the way , was more than he could do himself .
john solomon , or solomon john ?
she calls you solomon , and she must know , being your sister .
and i know you're john , you know .
which of the two goes first ?
and regarding that name of pross , likewise .
that warn't your name over the water .
what do you mean ?
well , i don't know all i mean , for i can't call to mind what your name was , over the water .
no ?
no .
but i'll swear it was a name of two syllables .
indeed ?
yes .
t'other one's was one syllable .
i know you .
you was a spywitness at the bailey .
what , in the name of the father of lies , own father to yourself , was you called at that time ?
barsad , said another voice , striking in .
that's the name for a thousand pound !
cried jerry .
the speaker who struck in , was sydney carton .
he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his ridingcoat , and he stood at mr. cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself .
don't be alarmed , my dear miss pross .
i arrived at mr. lorry's , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless i could be useful ; i present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother .
i wish you had a better employed brother than mr. barsad .
i wish for your sake mr. barsad was not a sheep of the prisons .
sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers .
the spy , who was pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared i'll tell you , said sydney .
i lighted on you , mr. barsad , coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago .
you have a face to be remembered , and i remember faces well .
made curious by seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are no stranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate , i walked in your direction .
i walked into the wineshop here , close after you , and sat near you .
i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling .
and gradually , what i had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , mr. barsad .
what purpose ?
the spy asked .
it would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street .
could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your companyat the office of tellson's bank , for instance ?
under a threat ?
oh !
did i say that ?
then , why should i go there ?
really , mr. barsad , i can't say , if you can't .
do you mean that you won't say , sir ?
the spy irresolutely asked .
you apprehend me very clearly , mr. barsad .
i won't .
carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill , in such a business as he had in his secret mind , and with such a man as he had to do with .
his practised eye saw it , and made the most of it .
now , i told you so , said the spy , casting a reproachful look at his sister ; if any trouble comes of this , it's your doing .
come , come , mr. barsad !
exclaimed sydney .
don't be ungrateful .
but for my great respect for your sister , i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction .
do you go with me to the bank ?
i'll hear what you have got to say .
yes , i'll go with you .
i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street .
let me take your arm , miss pross .
this is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your escort knows mr. barsad , i will invite him to mr. lorry's with us .
are we ready ?
come then !
miss pross recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on sydney's arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to solomon , there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes , which not only contradicted his light manner , but changed and raised the man .
she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection , and with sydney's friendly reassurances , adequately to heed what she observed .
they left her at the corner of the street , and carton led the way to mr. lorry's , which was within a few minutes' walk .
john barsad , or solomon pross , walked at his side .
mr. lorry had just finished his dinner , and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fireperhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellson's , who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover , now a good many years ago .
he turned his head as they entered , and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger .
miss pross's brother , sir , said sydney .
mr .
barsad .
barsad ?
repeated the old gentleman , barsad ?
i have an association with the nameand with the face .
i told you you had a remarkable face , mr. barsad , observed carton , coolly .
pray sit down .
as he took a chair himself , he supplied the link that mr. lorry wanted , by saying to him with a frown , witness at that trial .
mr. lorry immediately remembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence .
mr .
barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of , said sydney , and has acknowledged the relationship .
i pass to worse news .
darnay has been arrested again .
struck with consternation , the old gentleman exclaimed , what do you tell me !
i left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return to him !
arrested for all that .
when was it done , mr. barsad ?
just now , if at all .
mr .
barsad is the best authority possible , sir , said sydney , and i have it from mr. barsad's communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine , that the arrest has taken place .
he left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter .
there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken .
mr. lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point .
confused , but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive .
now , i trust , said sydney to him , that the name and influence of doctor manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrowyou said he would be before the tribunal again tomorrow , mr. barsad ?
yes ; i believe so .
in as good stead tomorrow as today .
but it may not be so .
i own to you , i am shaken , mr. lorry , by doctor manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest .
he may not have known of it beforehand , said mr. lorry .
but that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identified he is with his soninlaw .
that's true , mr. lorry acknowledged , with his troubled hand at his chin , and his troubled eyes on carton .
in short , said sydney , this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes .
let the doctor play the winning game ; i will play the losing one .
no man's life here is worth purchase .
any one carried home by the people today , may be condemned tomorrow .
now , the stake i have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the conciergerie .
and the friend i purpose to myself to win , is mr. barsad .
you need have good cards , sir , said the spy .
i'll run them over .
i'll see what i hold ,mr .
lorry , you know what a brute i am ; i wish you'd give me a little brandy .
it was put before him , and he drank off a glassfuldrank off another glassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away .
mr .
barsad , he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards : sheep of the prisons , emissary of republican committees , now turnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman , represents himself to his employers under a false name .
that's a very good card .
mr. barsad , now in the employ of the republican french government , was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government , the enemy of france and freedom .
that's an excellent card .
inference clear as day in this region of suspicion , that mr. barsad , still in the pay of the aristocratic english government , is the spy of pitt , the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom , the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find .
that's a card not to be beaten .
have you followed my hand , mr. barsad ?
not to understand your play , returned the spy , somewhat uneasily .
i play my ace , denunciation of mr. barsad to the nearest section committee .
look over your hand , mr. barsad , and see what you have .
don't hurry .
he drew the bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank it off .
he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him .
seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
look over your hand carefully , mr. barsad .
take time .
it was a poorer hand than he suspected .
mr. barsad saw losing cards in it that sydney carton knew nothing of .
thrown out of his honourable employment in england , through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he was not wanted there ; our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the channel , and accepted service in france : first , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there : gradually , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives .
he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarge's wineshop ; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning doctor manette's imprisonment , release , and history , as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the defarges ; and tried them on madame defarge , and had broken down with them signally .
he always remembered with fear and trembling , that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her , and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved .
he had since seen her , in the section of saint antoine , over and over again produce her knitted registers , and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up .
he knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down upon him .
once denounced , and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind , he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs , would produce against him that fatal register , and would quash his last chance of life .
besides that all secret men are men soon terrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over .
you scarcely seem to like your hand , said sydney , with the greatest composure .
do you play ?
i think , sir , said the spy , in the meanest manner , as he turned to mr. lorry , i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it to this other gentleman , so much your junior , whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken .
i admit that i am a spy , and that it is considered a discreditable stationthough it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ?
i play my ace , mr. barsad , said carton , taking the answer on himself , and looking at his watch , without any scruple , in a very few minutes .
i should have hoped , gentlemen both , said the spy , always striving to hook mr. lorry into the discussion , that your respect for my sister i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , said sydney carton .
you think not , sir ?
i have thoroughly made up my mind about it .
the smooth manner of the spy , curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress , and probably with his usual demeanour , received such a check from the inscrutability of carton ,who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he ,that it faltered here and failed him .
while he was at a loss , carton said , resuming his former air of contemplating cards : and indeed , now i think again , i have a strong impression that i have another good card here , not yet enumerated .
that friend and fellowsheep , who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons ; who was he ?
french .
you don't know him , said the spy , quickly .
french , eh ?
repeated carton , musing , and not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word .
well ; he may be .
is , i assure you , said the spy ; though it's not important .
though it's not important , repeated carton , in the same mechanical waythough it's not importantno , it's not important .
no .
yet i know the face .
i think not .
i am sure not .
it can't be , said the spy .
itcan'tbe , muttered sydney carton , retrospectively , and idling his glass which fortunately was a small one again .
can'tbe .
spoke good french .
yet like a foreigner , i thought ?
provincial , said the spy .
no .
foreign !
cried carton , striking his open hand on the table , as a light broke clearly on his mind .
cly !
disguised , but the same man .
we had that man before us at the old bailey .
now , there you are hasty , sir , said barsad , with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side ; there you really give me an advantage over you .
cly who i will unreservedly admit , at this distance of time , was a partner of mine has been dead several years .
i attended him in his last illness .
he was buried in london , at the church of saint pancrasinthefields .
his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains , but i helped to lay him in his coffin .
here , mr. lorry became aware , from where he sat , of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall .
tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on mr. cruncher's head .
let us be reasonable , said the spy , and let us be fair .
to show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , i will lay before you a certificate of cly's burial , which i happened to have carried in my pocketbook , with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , ever since .
there it is .
oh , look at it , look at it !
you may take it in your hand ; it's no forgery .
here , mr. lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate , and mr. cruncher rose and stepped forward .
his hair could not have been more violently on end , if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that jack built .
unseen by the spy , mr. cruncher stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff .
that there roger cly , master , said mr. cruncher , with a taciturn and ironbound visage .
so you put him in his coffin ?
i did .
who took him out of it ?
barsad leaned back in his chair , and stammered , what do you mean ?
i mean , said mr. cruncher , that he warn't never in it .
no !
not he !
i'll have my head took off , if he was ever in it .
the spy looked round at the two gentlemen ; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at jerry .
i tell you , said jerry , that you buried pavingstones and earth in that there coffin .
don't go and tell me that you buried cly .
it was a take in .
me and two more knows it .
how do you know it ?
what's that to you ?
ecod !
growled mr. cruncher , it's you i have got a old grudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen !
i'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea .
sydney carton , who , with mr. lorry , had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business , here requested mr. cruncher to moderate and explain himself .
at another time , sir , he returned , evasively , the present time is illconwenient for explainin' .
what i stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there cly was never in that there coffin .
let him say he was , in so much as a word of one syllable , and i'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea ; mr. cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer ; or i'll out and announce him .
humph !
i see one thing , said carton .
i hold another card , mr. barsad .
impossible , here in raging paris , with suspicion filling the air , for you to outlive denunciation , when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again !
a plot in the prisons , of the foreigner against the republic .
a strong carda certain guillotine card !
do you play ?
no !
returned the spy .
i throw up .
i confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that i only got away from england at the risk of being ducked to death , and that cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham .
though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me .
never you trouble your head about this man , retorted the contentious mr. cruncher ; you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman .
and look here !
once more !
mr .
cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberalityi'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea .
the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton , and said , with more decision , it has come to a point .
i go on duty soon , and can't overstay my time .
you told me you had a proposal ; what is it ?
now , it is of no use asking too much of me .
ask me to do anything in my office , putting my head in great extra danger , and i had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent .
in short , i should make that choice .
you talk of desperation .
we are all desperate here .
remember !
i may denounce you if i think proper , and i can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others .
now , what do you want with me ?
not very much .
you are a turnkey at the conciergerie ?
i tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , said the spy , firmly .
why need you tell me what i have not asked ?
you are a turnkey at the conciergerie ?
i am sometimes .
you can be when you choose ?
i can pass in and out when i choose .
sydney carton filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon the hearth , and watched it as it dropped .
it being all spent , he said , rising : so far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me .
come into the dark room here , and let us have one final word alone .
while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , mr. lorry looked at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust .
that honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look , did not inspire confidence ; he changed the leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examined his fingernails with a very questionable closeness of attention ; and whenever mr. lorry's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character .
jerry , said mr. lorry .
come here .
mr. cruncher came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance of him .
what have you been , besides a messenger ?
after some cogitation , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , mr. cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying , agicultooral character .
my mind misgives me much , said mr. lorry , angrily shaking a forefinger at him , that you have used the respectable and great house of tellson's as a blind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description .
if you have , don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to england .
if you have , don't expect me to keep your secret .
tellson's shall not be imposed upon .
i hope , sir , pleaded the abashed mr. cruncher , that a gentleman like yourself wot i've had the honour of odd jobbing till i'm grey at it , would think twice about harming of me , even if it wos soi don't say it is , but even if it wos .
and which it is to be took into account that if it wos , it wouldn't , even then , be all o' one side .
there'd be two sides to it .
there might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardensfardens !
no , nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens !
no , nor yet his quartera banking away like smoke at tellson's , and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out to their own carriagesah !
equally like smoke , if not more so .
well , that 'ud be imposing , too , on tellson's .
for you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander .
and here's mrs. cruncher , or leastways wos in the old england times , and would be tomorrow , if cause given , a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating !
whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flopcatch 'em at it !
or , if they flop , their floppings goes in favour of more patients , and how can you rightly have one without t'other ?
then , wot with undertakers , and wot with parish clerks , and wot with sextons , and wot with private watchmen all awaricious and all in it , a man wouldn't get much by it , even if it wos so .
and wot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , mr. lorry .
he'd never have no good of it ; he'd want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once ineven if it wos so .
ugh !
cried mr. lorry , rather relenting , nevertheless , i am shocked at the sight of you .
now , what i would humbly offer to you , sir , pursued mr. cruncher , even if it wos so , which i don't say it is don't prevaricate , said mr. lorry .
no , i will not , sir , returned mr. crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practicewhich i don't say it iswot i would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this .
upon that there stool , at that there bar , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , generallightjob you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes .
if it wos so , which i still don't say it is for i will not prewaricate to you , sir , let that there boy keep his father's place , and take care of his mother ; don't blow upon that boy's fatherdo not do it , sirand let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin' , and make amends for what he would have undugif it wos soby diggin' of 'em in with a will , and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe .
that , mr. lorry , said mr. cruncher , wiping his forehead with his arm , as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse , is wot i would respectfully offer to you , sir .
a man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him , in the way of subjects without heads , dear me , plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that , without havin' his serious thoughts of things .
and these here would be mine , if it wos so , entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now , i up and said in the good cause when i might have kep' it back .
that at least is true , said mr. lorry .
say no more now .
it may be that i shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in actionnot in words .
i want no more words .
mr. cruncher knuckled his forehead , as sydney carton and the spy returned from the dark room .
adieu , mr. barsad , said the former ; our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me .
he sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against mr. lorry .
when they were alone , mr. lorry asked him what he had done ?
not much .
if it should go ill with the prisoner , i have ensured access to him , once .
mr. lorry's countenance fell .
it is all i could do , said carton .
to propose too much , would be to put this man's head under the axe , and , as he himself said , nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced .
it was obviously the weakness of the position .
there is no help for it .
but access to him , said mr. lorry , if it should go ill before the tribunal , will not save him .
i never said it would .
mr. lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest , gradually weakened them ; he was an old man now , overborne with anxiety of late , and his tears fell .
you are a good man and a true friend , said carton , in an altered voice .
forgive me if i notice that you are affected .
i could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless .
and i could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father .
you are free from that misfortune , however .
though he said the last words , with a slip into his usual manner , there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch , that mr. lorry , who had never seen the better side of him , was wholly unprepared for .
he gave him his hand , and carton gently pressed it .
to return to poor darnay , said carton .
don't tell her of this interview , or this arrangement .
it would not enable her to go to see him .
she might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence .
mr. lorry had not thought of that , and he looked quickly at carton to see if it were in his mind .
it seemed to be ; he returned the look , and evidently understood it .
she might think a thousand things , carton said , and any of them would only add to her trouble .
don't speak of me to her .
as i said to you when i first came , i had better not see her .
i can put my hand out , to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do , without that .
you are going to her , i hope ?
she must be very desolate tonight .
i am going now , directly .
i am glad of that .
she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you .
how does she look ?
anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful .
ah !
it was a long , grieving sound , like a sighalmost like a sob .
it attracted mr. lorry's eyes to carton's face , which was turned to the fire .
a light , or a shade the old gentleman could not have said which , passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hillside on a wild bright day , and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs , which was tumbling forward .
he wore the white ridingcoat and topboots , then in vogue , and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale , with his long brown hair , all untrimmed , hanging loose about him .
his indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr. lorry ; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log , when it had broken under the weight of his foot .
i forgot it , he said .
mr. lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face .
taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression .
and your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ?
said carton , turning to him .
yes .
as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so unexpectedly , i have at length done all that i can do here .
i hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted paris .
i have my leave to pass .
i was ready to go .
they were both silent .
yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ?
said carton , wistfully .
i am in my seventyeighth year .
you have been useful all your life ; steadily and constantly occupied ; trusted , respected , and looked up to ?
i have been a man of business , ever since i have been a man .
indeed , i may say that i was a man of business when a boy .
see what a place you fill at seventyeight .
how many people will miss you when you leave it empty !
a solitary old bachelor , answered mr. lorry , shaking his head .
there is nobody to weep for me .
how can you say that ?
wouldn't she weep for you ?
wouldn't her child ?
yes , yes , thank god .
i didn't quite mean what i said .
it is a thing to thank god for ; is it not ?
surely , surely .
if you could say , with truth , to your own solitary heart , tonight , 'i have secured to myself the love and attachment , the gratitude or respect , of no human creature ; i have won myself a tender place in no regard ; i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by !
'your seventyeight years would be seventyeight heavy curses ; would they not ?
you say truly , mr. carton ; i think they would be .
sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire , and , after a silence of a few moments , said : i should like to ask you :does your childhood seem far off ?
do the days when you sat at your mother's knee , seem days of very long ago ?
responding to his softened manner , mr. lorry answered : twenty years back , yes ; at this time of my life , no .
for , as i draw closer and closer to the end , i travel in the circle , nearer and nearer to the beginning .
it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way .
my heart is touched now , by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep , of my pretty young mother and i so old !
 ,and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not so real with me , and my faults were not confirmed in me .
i understand the feeling !
exclaimed carton , with a bright flush .
and you are the better for it ?
i hope so .
carton terminated the conversation here , by rising to help him on with his outer coat ; but you , said mr. lorry , reverting to the theme , you are young .
yes , said carton .
i am not old , but my young way was never the way to age .
enough of me .
and of me , i am sure , said mr. lorry .
are you going out ?
i'll walk with you to her gate .
you know my vagabond and restless habits .
if i should prowl about the streets a long time , don't be uneasy ; i shall reappear in the morning .
you go to the court tomorrow ?
yes , unhappily .
i shall be there , but only as one of the crowd .
my spy will find a place for me .
take my arm , sir .
mr. lorry did so , and they went downstairs and out in the streets .
a few minutes brought them to mr. lorry's destination .
carton left him there ; but lingered at a little distance , and turned back to the gate again when it was shut , and touched it .
he had heard of her going to the prison every day .
she came out here , he said , looking about him , turned this way , must have trod on these stones often .
let me follow in her steps .
it was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force , where she had stood hundreds of times .
a little woodsawyer , having closed his shop , was smoking his pipe at his shopdoor .
good night , citizen , said sydney carton , pausing in going by ; for , the man eyed him inquisitively .
good night , citizen .
how goes the republic ?
you mean the guillotine .
not ill .
sixtythree today .
we shall mount to a hundred soon .
samson and his men complain sometimes , of being exhausted .
ha , ha , ha !
he is so droll , that samson .
such a barber !
do you often go to see him shave ?
always .
every day .
what a barber !
you have seen him at work ?
never .
go and see him when he has a good batch .
figure this to yourself , citizen ; he shaved the sixtythree today , in less than two pipes !
less than two pipes .
word of honour !
as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking , to explain how he timed the executioner , carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him , that he turned away .
but you are not english , said the woodsawyer , though you wear english dress ?
yes , said carton , pausing again , and answering over his shoulder .
you speak like a frenchman .
i am an old student here .
aha , a perfect frenchman !
good night , englishman .
good night , citizen .
but go and see that droll dog , the little man persisted , calling after him .
and take a pipe with you !
sydney had not gone far out of sight , when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp , and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper .
then , traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well , several dark and dirty streetsmuch dirtier than usual , for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terrorhe stopped at a chemist's shop , which the owner was closing with his own hands .
a small , dim , crooked shop , kept in a tortuous , uphill thoroughfare , by a small , dim , crooked man .
giving this citizen , too , good night , as he confronted him at his counter , he laid the scrap of paper before him .
whew !
the chemist whistled softly , as he read it .
hi !
hi !
hi !
sydney carton took no heed , and the chemist said : for you , citizen ?
for me .
you will be careful to keep them separate , citizen ?
you know the consequences of mixing them ?
perfectly .
certain small packets were made and given to him .
he put them , one by one , in the breast of his inner coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop .
there is nothing more to do , said he , glancing upward at the moon , until tomorrow .
i can't sleep .
it was not a reckless manner , the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fastsailing clouds , nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance .
it was the settled manner of a tired man , who had wandered and struggled and got lost , but who at length struck into his road and saw its end .
long ago , when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise , he had followed his father to the grave .
his mother had died , years before .
these solemn words , which had been read at his father's grave , arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets , among the heavy shadows , with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him .
i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me , shall never die .
in a city dominated by the axe , alone at night , with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixtythree who had been that day put to death , and for tomorrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons , and still of tomorrow's and tomorrow's , the chain of association that brought the words home , like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep , might have been easily found .
he did not seek it , but repeated them and went on .
with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest , forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them ; in the towers of the churches , where no prayers were said , for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors , plunderers , and profligates ; in the distant burialplaces , reserved , as they wrote upon the gates , for eternal sleep ; in the abounding gaols ; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material , that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the guillotine ; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury ; sydney carton crossed the seine again for the lighter streets .
few coaches were abroad , for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected , and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps , and put on heavy shoes , and trudged .
but , the theatres were all well filled , and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed , and went chatting home .
at one of the theatre doors , there was a little girl with a mother , looking for a way across the street through the mud .
he carried the child over , and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss .
i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me , shall never die .
now , that the streets were quiet , and the night wore on , the words were in the echoes of his feet , and were in the air .
perfectly calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked ; but , he heard them always .
the night wore out , and , as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the riverwalls of the island of paris , where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon , the day came coldly , looking like a dead face out of the sky .
then , the night , with the moon and the stars , turned pale and died , and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to death's dominion .
but , the glorious sun , rising , seemed to strike those words , that burden of the night , straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays .
and looking along them , with reverently shaded eyes , a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun , while the river sparkled under it .
the strong tide , so swift , so deep , and certain , was like a congenial friend , in the morning stillness .
he walked by the stream , far from the houses , and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank .
when he awoke and was afoot again , he lingered there yet a little longer , watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless , until the stream absorbed it , and carried it on to the sea .
likeme .
a tradingboat , with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf , then glided into his view , floated by him , and died away .
as its silent track in the water disappeared , the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors , ended in the words , i am the resurrection and the life .
mr. lorry was already out when he got back , and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone .
sydney carton drank nothing but a little coffee , ate some bread , and , having washed and changed to refresh himself , went out to the place of trial .
the court was all astir and abuzz , when the black sheepwhom many fell away from in dreadpressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd .
mr. lorry was there , and doctor manette was there .
she was there , sitting beside her father .
when her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so sustaining , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness , yet so courageous for his sake , that it called the healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart .
if there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look , on sydney carton , it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly .
before that unjust tribunal , there was little or no order of procedure , ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing .
there could have been no such revolution , if all laws , forms , and ceremonies , had not first been so monstrously abused , that the suicidal vengeance of the revolution was to scatter them all to the winds .
every eye was turned to the jury .
the same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before , and tomorrow and the day after .
eager and prominent among them , one man with a craving face , and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips , whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators .
a lifethirsting , canniballooking , bloodyminded juryman , the jacques three of st .
antoine .
the whole jury , as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer .
every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor .
no favourable leaning in that quarter today .
a fell , uncompromising , murderous businessmeaning there .
every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd , and gleamed at it approvingly ; and heads nodded at one another , before bending forward with a strained attention .
charles evremonde , called darnay .
released yesterday .
reaccused and retaken yesterday .
indictment delivered to him last night .
suspected and denounced enemy of the republic , aristocrat , one of a family of tyrants , one of a race proscribed , for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people .
charles evremonde , called darnay , in right of such proscription , absolutely dead in law .
to this effect , in as few or fewer words , the public prosecutor .
the president asked , was the accused openly denounced or secretly ?
openly , president .
by whom ?
three voices .
ernest defarge , winevendor of st .
antoine .
good .
therese defarge , his wife .
good .
alexandre manette , physician .
a great uproar took place in the court , and in the midst of it , doctor manette was seen , pale and trembling , standing where he had been seated .
president , i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud .
you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter .
my daughter , and those dear to her , are far dearer to me than my life .
who and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband of my child !
citizen manette , be tranquil .
to fail in submission to the authority of the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law .
as to what is dearer to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the republic .
loud acclamations hailed this rebuke .
the president rang his bell , and with warmth resumed .
if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself , you would have no duty but to sacrifice her .
listen to what is to follow .
in the meanwhile , be silent !
frantic acclamations were again raised .
doctor manette sat down , with his eyes looking around , and his lips trembling ; his daughter drew closer to him .
the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth .
defarge was produced , when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard , and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment , and of his having been a mere boy in the doctor's service , and of the release , and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him .
this short examination followed , for the court was quick with its work .
you did good service at the taking of the bastille , citizen ?
i believe so .
here , an excited woman screeched from the crowd : you were one of the best patriots there .
why not say so ?
you were a cannonier that day there , and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell .
patriots , i speak the truth !
it was the vengeance who , amidst the warm commendations of the audience , thus assisted the proceedings .
the president rang his bell ; but , the vengeance , warming with encouragement , shrieked , i defy that bell !
wherein she was likewise much commended .
inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille , citizen .
i knew , said defarge , looking down at his wife , who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised , looking steadily up at him ; i knew that this prisoner , of whom i speak , had been confined in a cell known as one hundred and five , north tower .
i knew it from himself .
he knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five , north tower , when he made shoes under my care .
as i serve my gun that day , i resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell .
it falls .
i mount to the cell , with a fellowcitizen who is one of the jury , directed by a gaoler .
i examine it , very closely .
in a hole in the chimney , where a stone has been worked out and replaced , i find a written paper .
this is that written paper .
i have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of doctor manette .
this is the writing of doctor manette .
i confide this paper , in the writing of doctor manette , to the hands of the president .
let it be read .
in a dead silence and stillnessthe prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife , his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father , doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader , madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner , defarge never taking his from his feasting wife , and all the other eyes there intent upon the doctor , who saw none of themthe paper was read , as follows .
i , alexandre manette , unfortunate physician , native of beauvais , and afterwards resident in paris , write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the bastille , during the last month of the year , 1767 .
i write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty .
i design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney , where i have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it .
some pitying hand may find it there , when i and my sorrows are dust .
these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney , mixed with blood , in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity .
hope has quite departed from my breast .
i know from terrible warnings i have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired , but i solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right mindthat my memory is exact and circumstantialand that i write the truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words , whether they be ever read by men or not , at the eternal judgmentseat .
one cloudy moonlight night , in the third week of december i think the twentysecond of the month in the year 1757 , i was walking on a retired part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air , at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the street of the school of medicine , when a carriage came along behind me , driven very fast .
as i stood aside to let that carriage pass , apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down , a head was put out at the window , and a voice called to the driver to stop .
the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses , and the same voice called to me by my name .
i answered .
the carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before i came up with it .
i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks , and appeared to conceal themselves .
as they stood side by side near the carriage door , i also observed that they both looked of about my own age , or rather younger , and that they were greatly alike , in stature , manner , voice , and as far as i could see face too .
'you are doctor manette ?
'said one .
i am .
'doctor manette , formerly of beauvais ,' said the other ; 'the young physician , originally an expert surgeon , who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in paris ?
''gentlemen ,' i returned , 'i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so graciously .
''we have been to your residence ,' said the first , 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there , and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction , we followed , in the hope of overtaking you .
will you please to enter the carriage ?
'the manner of both was imperious , and they both moved , as these words were spoken , so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door .
they were armed .
i was not .
'gentlemen ,' said i , 'pardon me ; but i usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance , and what is the nature of the case to which i am summoned .
'the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second .
'doctor , your clients are people of condition .
as to the nature of the case , our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it .
enough .
will you please to enter the carriage ?
'i could do nothing but comply , and i entered it in silence .
they both entered after methe last springing in , after putting up the steps .
the carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed .
i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred .
i have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same .
i describe everything exactly as it took place , constraining my mind not to wander from the task .
where i make the broken marks that follow here , i leave off for the time , and put my paper in its hidingplace .
the carriage left the streets behind , passed the north barrier , and emerged upon the country road .
at twothirds of a league from the barrieri did not estimate the distance at that time , but afterwards when i traversed itit struck out of the main avenue , and presently stopped at a solitary house , we all three alighted , and walked , by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed , to the door of the house .
it was not opened immediately , in answer to the ringing of the bell , and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it , with his heavy riding glove , across the face .
there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention , for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs .
but , the other of the two , being angry likewise , struck the man in like manner with his arm ; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike , that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers .
from the time of our alighting at the outer gate which we found locked , and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us , and had relocked , i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber .
i was conducted to this chamber straight , the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs , and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain , lying on a bed .
the patient was a woman of great beauty , and young ; assuredly not much past twenty .
her hair was torn and ragged , and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs .
i noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman's dress .
on one of them , which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony , i saw the armorial bearings of a noble , and the letter e .
i saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient ; for , in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation .
my first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing ; and in moving the scarf aside , the embroidery in the corner caught my sight .
i turned her gently over , placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down , and looked into her face .
her eyes were dilated and wild , and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks , and repeated the words , 'my husband , my father , and my brother !
'and then counted up to twelve , and said , 'hush !
'for an instant , and no more , she would pause to listen , and then the piercing shrieks would begin again , and she would repeat the cry , 'my husband , my father , and my brother !
'and would count up to twelve , and say , 'hush !
'there was no variation in the order , or the manner .
there was no cessation , but the regular moment's pause , in the utterance of these sounds .
'how long ,' i asked , 'has this lasted ?
'to distinguish the brothers , i will call them the elder and the younger ; by the elder , i mean him who exercised the most authority .
it was the elder who replied , 'since about this hour last night .
''she has a husband , a father , and a brother ?
''a brother .
''i do not address her brother ?
'he answered with great contempt , 'no .
''she has some recent association with the number twelve ?
'the younger brother impatiently rejoined , 'with twelve o'clock ?
''see , gentlemen ,' said i , still keeping my hands upon her breast , 'how useless i am , as you have brought me !
if i had known what i was coming to see , i could have come provided .
as it is , time must be lost .
there are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place .
'the elder brother looked to the younger , who said haughtily , 'there is a case of medicines here ;' and brought it from a closet , and put it on the table .
i opened some of the bottles , smelt them , and put the stoppers to my lips .
if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves , i would not have administered any of those .
'do you doubt them ?
'asked the younger brother .
'you see , monsieur , i am going to use them ,' i replied , and said no more .
i made the patient swallow , with great difficulty , and after many efforts , the dose that i desired to give .
as i intended to repeat it after a while , and as it was necessary to watch its influence , i then sat down by the side of the bed .
there was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance wife of the man downstairs , who had retreated into a corner .
the house was damp and decayed , indifferently furnishedevidently , recently occupied and temporarily used .
some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows , to deaden the sound of the shrieks .
they continued to be uttered in their regular succession , with the cry , 'my husband , my father , and my brother !
'the counting up to twelve , and 'hush !
'the frenzy was so violent , that i had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms ; but , i had looked to them , to see that they were not painful .
the only spark of encouragement in the case , was , that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence , that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure .
it had no effect upon the cries ; no pendulum could be more regular .
for the reason that my hand had this effect i assume , i had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour , with the two brothers looking on , before the elder said : 'there is another patient .
'i was startled , and asked , 'is it a pressing case ?
''you had better see ,' he carelessly answered ; and took up a light .
the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase , which was a species of loft over a stable .
there was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it ; the rest was open , to the ridge of the tiled roof , and there were beams across .
hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place , fagots for firing , and a heap of apples in sand .
i had to pass through that part , to get at the other .
my memory is circumstantial and unshaken .
i try it with these details , and i see them all , in this my cell in the bastille , near the close of the tenth year of my captivity , as i saw them all that night .
on some hay on the ground , with a cushion thrown under his head , lay a handsome peasant boya boy of not more than seventeen at the most .
he lay on his back , with his teeth set , his right hand clenched on his breast , and his glaring eyes looking straight upward .
i could not see where his wound was , as i kneeled on one knee over him ; but , i could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point .
'i am a doctor , my poor fellow ,' said i .
'let me examine it .
''i do not want it examined ,' he answered ; 'let it be .
'it was under his hand , and i soothed him to let me move his hand away .
the wound was a swordthrust , received from twenty to twentyfour hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay .
he was then dying fast .
as i turned my eyes to the elder brother , i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out , as if he were a wounded bird , or hare , or rabbit ; not at all as if he were a fellowcreature .
'how has this been done , monsieur ?
'said i .
'a crazed young common dog !
a serf !
forced my brother to draw upon him , and has fallen by my brother's swordlike a gentleman .
'there was no touch of pity , sorrow , or kindred humanity , in this answer .
the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there , and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind .
he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy , or about his fate .
the boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken , and they now slowly moved to me .
'doctor , they are very proud , these nobles ; but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes .
they plunder us , outrage us , beat us , kill us ; but we have a little pride left , sometimes .
shehave you seen her , doctor ?
'the shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance .
he referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence .
i said , 'i have seen her .
''she is my sister , doctor .
they have had their shameful rights , these nobles , in the modesty and virtue of our sisters , many years , but we have had good girls among us .
i know it , and have heard my father say so .
she was a good girl .
she was betrothed to a good young man , too : a tenant of his .
we were all tenants of histhat man's who stands there .
the other is his brother , the worst of a bad race .
'it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak ; but , his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis .
'we were so robbed by that man who stands there , as all we common dogs are by those superior beingstaxed by him without mercy , obliged to work for him without pay , obliged to grind our corn at his mill , obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops , and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own , pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat , we ate it in fear , with the door barred and the shutters closed , that his people should not see it and take it from usi say , we were so robbed , and hunted , and were made so poor , that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world , and that what we should most pray for , was , that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out !
'i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed , bursting forth like a fire .
i had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere ; but , i had never seen it break out , until i saw it in the dying boy .
'nevertheless , doctor , my sister married .
he was ailing at that time , poor fellow , and she married her lover , that she might tend and comfort him in our cottageour doghut , as that man would call it .
she had not been married many weeks , when that man's brother saw her and admired her , and asked that man to lend her to himfor what are husbands among us !
he was willing enough , but my sister was good and virtuous , and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine .
what did the two then , to persuade her husband to use his influence with her , to make her willing ?
'the boy's eyes , which had been fixed on mine , slowly turned to the lookeron , and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true .
the two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another , i can see , even in this bastille ; the gentleman's , all negligent indifference ; the peasant's , all troddendown sentiment , and passionate revenge .
'you know , doctor , that it is among the rights of these nobles to harness us common dogs to carts , and drive us .
they so harnessed him and drove him .
you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their grounds all night , quieting the frogs , in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed .
they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night , and ordered him back into his harness in the day .
but he was not persuaded .
no !
taken out of harness one day at noon , to feedif he could find foodhe sobbed twelve times , once for every stroke of the bell , and died on her bosom .
'nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong .
he forced back the gathering shadows of death , as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched , and to cover his wound .
'then , with that man's permission and even with his aid , his brother took her away ; in spite of what i know she must have told his brotherand what that is , will not be long unknown to you , doctor , if it is nowhis brother took her awayfor his pleasure and diversion , for a little while .
i saw her pass me on the road .
when i took the tidings home , our father's heart burst ; he never spoke one of the words that filled it .
i took my young sister for i have another to a place beyond the reach of this man , and where , at least , she will never be his vassal .
then , i tracked the brother here , and last night climbed ina common dog , but sword in hand .
whereis the loft window ?
it was somewhere here ?
'the room was darkening to his sight ; the world was narrowing around him .
i glanced about me , and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor , as if there had been a struggle .
'she heard me , and ran in .
i told her not to come near us till he was dead .
he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip .
but i , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw .
let him break into as many pieces as he will , the sword that he stained with my common blood ; he drew to defend himselfthrust at me with all his skill for his life .
'my glance had fallen , but a few moments before , on the fragments of a broken sword , lying among the hay .
that weapon was a gentleman's .
in another place , lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's .
'now , lift me up , doctor ; lift me up .
where is he ?
''he is not here ,' i said , supporting the boy , and thinking that he referred to the brother .
'he !
proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me .
where is the man who was here ?
turn my face to him .
'i did so , raising the boy's head against my knee .
but , invested for the moment with extraordinary power , he raised himself completely : obliging me to rise too , or i could not have still supported him .
'marquis ,' said the boy , turned to him with his eyes opened wide , and his right hand raised , 'in the days when all these things are to be answered for , i summon you and yours , to the last of your bad race , to answer for them .
i mark this cross of blood upon you , as a sign that i do it .
in the days when all these things are to be answered for , i summon your brother , the worst of the bad race , to answer for them separately .
i mark this cross of blood upon him , as a sign that i do it .
'twice , he put his hand to the wound in his breast , and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air .
he stood for an instant with the finger yet raised , and as it dropped , he dropped with it , and i laid him down dead .
when i returned to the bedside of the young woman , i found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity .
i knew that this might last for many hours , and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave .
i repeated the medicines i had given her , and i sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced .
she never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks , never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words .
they were always 'my husband , my father , and my brother !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve .
hush !
'this lasted twentysix hours from the time when i first saw her .
i had come and gone twice , and was again sitting by her , when she began to falter .
i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity , and byandbye she sank into a lethargy , and lay like the dead .
it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last , after a long and fearful storm .
i released her arms , and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn .
it was then that i knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen ; and it was then that i lost the little hope i had had of her .
'is she dead ?
'asked the marquis , whom i will still describe as the elder brother , coming booted into the room from his horse .
'not dead ,' said i ; 'but like to die .
''what strength there is in these common bodies !
'he said , looking down at her with some curiosity .
'there is prodigious strength ,' i answered him , 'in sorrow and despair .
'he first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them .
he moved a chair with his foot near to mine , ordered the woman away , and said in a subdued voice , 'doctor , finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds , i recommended that your aid should be invited .
your reputation is high , and , as a young man with your fortune to make , you are probably mindful of your interest .
the things that you see here , are things to be seen , and not spoken of .
'i listened to the patient's breathing , and avoided answering .
'do you honour me with your attention , doctor ?
''monsieur ,' said i , 'in my profession , the communications of patients are always received in confidence .
'i was guarded in my answer , for i was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen .
her breathing was so difficult to trace , that i carefully tried the pulse and the heart .
there was life , and no more .
looking round as i resumed my seat , i found both the brothers intent upon me .
i write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , i am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that i must abridge this narrative .
there is no confusion or failure in my memory ; it can recall , and could detail , every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers .
she lingered for a week .
towards the last , i could understand some few syllables that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips .
she asked me where she was , and i told her ; who i was , and i told her .
it was in vain that i asked her for her family name .
she faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done .
i had no opportunity of asking her any question , until i had told the brothers she was sinking fast , and could not live another day .
until then , though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself , one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there .
but when it came to that , they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her ; as ifthe thought passed through my mindi were dying too .
i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's as i call him having crossed swords with a peasant , and that peasant a boy .
the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family , and was ridiculous .
as often as i caught the younger brother's eyes , their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply , for knowing what i knew from the boy .
he was smoother and more polite to me than the elder ; but i saw this .
i also saw that i was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder , too .
my patient died , two hours before midnightat a time , by my watch , answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her .
i was alone with her , when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side , and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended .
the brothers were waiting in a room downstairs , impatient to ride away .
i had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their ridingwhips , and loitering up and down .
'at last she is dead ?
'said the elder , when i went in .
'she is dead ,' said i .
'i congratulate you , my brother ,' were his words as he turned round .
he had before offered me money , which i had postponed taking .
he now gave me a rouleau of gold .
i took it from his hand , but laid it on the table .
i had considered the question , and had resolved to accept nothing .
'pray excuse me ,' said i .
'under the circumstances , no .
'they exchanged looks , but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to them , and we parted without another word on either side .
i am weary , weary , wearyworn down by misery .
i cannot read what i have written with this gaunt hand .
early in the morning , the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box , with my name on the outside .
from the first , i had anxiously considered what i ought to do .
i decided , that day , to write privately to the minister , stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been summoned , and the place to which i had gone : in effect , stating all the circumstances .
i knew what court influence was , and what the immunities of the nobles were , and i expected that the matter would never be heard of ; but , i wished to relieve my own mind .
i had kept the matter a profound secret , even from my wife ; and this , too , i resolved to state in my letter .
i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger ; but i was conscious that there might be danger for others , if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed .
i was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night .
i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it .
it was the last day of the year .
the letter was lying before me just completed , when i was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me .
i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself .
it is so cold , so dark , my senses are so benumbed , and the gloom upon me is so dreadful .
the lady was young , engaging , and handsome , but not marked for long life .
she was in great agitation .
she presented herself to me as the wife of the marquis st .
evremonde .
i connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother , with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf , and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i had seen that nobleman very lately .
my memory is still accurate , but i cannot write the words of our conversation .
i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was , and i know not at what times i may be watched .
she had in part suspected , and in part discovered , the main facts of the cruel story , of her husband's share in it , and my being resorted to .
she did not know that the girl was dead .
her hope had been , she said in great distress , to show her , in secret , a woman's sympathy .
her hope had been to avert the wrath of heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many .
she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living , and her greatest desire was , to help that sister .
i could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , i knew nothing .
her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that i could tell her the name and place of abode .
whereas , to this wretched hour i am ignorant of both .
these scraps of paper fail me .
one was taken from me , with a warning , yesterday .
i must finish my record today .
she was a good , compassionate lady , and not happy in her marriage .
how could she be !
the brother distrusted and disliked her , and his influence was all opposed to her ; she stood in dread of him , and in dread of her husband too .
when i handed her down to the door , there was a child , a pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage .
'for his sake , doctor ,' she said , pointing to him in tears , 'i would do all i can to make what poor amends i can .
he will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise .
i have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this , it will one day be required of him .
what i have left to call my ownit is little beyond the worth of a few jewelsi will make it the first charge of his life to bestow , with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother , on this injured family , if the sister can be discovered .
'she kissed the boy , and said , caressing him , 'it is for thine own dear sake .
thou wilt be faithful , little charles ?
'the child answered her bravely , 'yes !
'i kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him .
i never saw her more .
as she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that i knew it , i added no mention of it to my letter .
i sealed my letter , and , not trusting it out of my own hands , delivered it myself that day .
that night , the last night of the year , towards nine o'clock , a man in a black dress rang at my gate , demanded to see me , and softly followed my servant , ernest defarge , a youth , upstairs .
when my servant came into the room where i sat with my wifeo my wife , beloved of my heart !
my fair young english wife !
wesaw the man , who was supposed to be at the gate , standing silent behind him .
an urgent case in the rue st .
honore , he said .
it would not detain me , he had a coach in waiting .
it brought me here , it brought me to my grave .
when i was clear of the house , a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind , and my arms were pinioned .
the two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner , and identified me with a single gesture .
the marquis took from his pocket the letter i had written , showed it me , burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held , and extinguished the ashes with his foot .
not a word was spoken .
i was brought here , i was brought to my living grave .
if it had pleased god to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers , in all these frightful years , to grant me any tidings of my dearest wifeso much as to let me know by a word whether alive or deadi might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them .
but , now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in his mercies .
and them and their descendants , to the last of their race , i , alexandre manette , unhappy prisoner , do this last night of the year 1767 , in my unbearable agony , denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for .
i denounce them to heaven and to earth .
a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done .
a sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood .
the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time , and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it .
little need , in presence of that tribunal and that auditory , to show how the defarges had not made the paper public , with the other captured bastille memorials borne in procession , and had kept it , biding their time .
little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by saint antoine , and was wrought into the fatal register .
the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day , against such denunciation .
and all the worse for the doomed man , that the denouncer was a wellknown citizen , his own attached friend , the father of his wife .
one of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was , for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity , and for sacrifices and selfimmolations on the people's altar .
therefore when the president said else had his own head quivered on his shoulders , that the good physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats , and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan , there was wild excitement , patriotic fervour , not a touch of human sympathy .
much influence around him , has that doctor ?
murmured madame defarge , smiling to the vengeance .
save him now , my doctor , save him !
at every juryman's vote , there was a roar .
another and another .
roar and roar .
unanimously voted .
at heart and by descent an aristocrat , an enemy of the republic , a notorious oppressor of the people .
back to the conciergerie , and death within fourandtwenty hours !
the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die , fell under the sentence , as if she had been mortally stricken .
but , she uttered no sound ; and so strong was the voice within her , representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it , that it quickly raised her , even from that shock .
the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors , the tribunal adjourned .
the quick noise and movement of the court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased , when lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband , with nothing in her face but love and consolation .
if i might touch him !
if i might embrace him once !
o , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us !
there was but a gaoler left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and barsad .
the people had all poured out to the show in the streets .
barsad proposed to the rest , let her embrace him then ; it is but a moment .
it was silently acquiesced in , and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place , where he , by leaning over the dock , could fold her in his arms .
farewell , dear darling of my soul .
my parting blessing on my love .
we shall meet again , where the weary are at rest !
they were her husband's words , as he held her to his bosom .
i can bear it , dear charles .
i am supported from above : don't suffer for me .
a parting blessing for our child .
i send it to her by you .
i kiss her by you .
i say farewell to her by you .
my husband .
no !
a moment !
he was tearing himself apart from her .
we shall not be separated long .
i feel that this will break my heart byandbye ; but i will do my duty while i can , and when i leave her , god will raise up friends for her , as he did for me .
her father had followed her , and would have fallen on his knees to both of them , but that darnay put out a hand and seized him , crying : no , no !
what have you done , what have you done , that you should kneel to us !
we know now , what a struggle you made of old .
we know , now what you underwent when you suspected my descent , and when you knew it .
we know now , the natural antipathy you strove against , and conquered , for her dear sake .
we thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty .
heaven be with you !
her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair , and wring them with a shriek of anguish .
it could not be otherwise , said the prisoner .
all things have worked together as they have fallen out .
it was the alwaysvain endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence near you .
good could never come of such evil , a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning .
be comforted , and forgive me .
heaven bless you !
as he was drawn away , his wife released him , and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer , and with a radiant look upon her face , in which there was even a comforting smile .
as he went out at the prisoners' door , she turned , laid her head lovingly on her father's breast , tried to speak to him , and fell at his feet .
then , issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved , sydney carton came and took her up .
only her father and mr. lorry were with her .
his arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head .
yet , there was an air about him that was not all of pitythat had a flush of pride in it .
shall i take her to a coach ?
i shall never feel her weight .
he carried her lightly to the door , and laid her tenderly down in a coach .
her father and their old friend got into it , and he took his seat beside the driver .
when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms .
there , he laid her down on a couch , where her child and miss pross wept over her .
don't recall her to herself , he said , softly , to the latter , she is better so .
don't revive her to consciousness , while she only faints .
oh , carton , carton , dear carton !
cried little lucie , springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him , in a burst of grief .
now that you have come , i think you will do something to help mamma , something to save papa !
o , look at her , dear carton !
can you , of all the people who love her , bear to see her so ?
he bent over the child , and laid her blooming cheek against his face .
he put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother .
before i go , he said , and pausedi may kiss her ?
it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words .
the child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , a life you love .
when he had gone out into the next room , he turned suddenly on mr. lorry and her father , who were following , and said to the latter : you had great influence but yesterday , doctor manette ; let it at least be tried .
these judges , and all the men in power , are very friendly to you , and very recognisant of your services ; are they not ?
nothing connected with charles was concealed from me .
i had the strongest assurances that i should save him ; and i did .
he returned the answer in great trouble , and very slowly .
try them again .
the hours between this and tomorrow afternoon are few and short , but try .
i intend to try .
i will not rest a moment .
that's well .
i have known such energy as yours do great things before nowthough never , he added , with a smile and a sigh together , such great things as this .
but try !
of little worth as life is when we misuse it , it is worth that effort .
it would cost nothing to lay down if it were not .
i will go , said doctor manette , to the prosecutor and the president straight , and i will go to others whom it is better not to name .
i will write too , andbut stay !
there is a celebration in the streets , and no one will be accessible until dark .
that's true .
well !
it is a forlorn hope at the best , and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark .
i should like to know how you speed ; though , mind !
i expect nothing !
when are you likely to have seen these dread powers , doctor manette ?
immediately after dark , i should hope .
within an hour or two from this .
it will be dark soon after four .
let us stretch the hour or two .
if i go to mr. lorry's at nine , shall i hear what you have done , either from our friend or from yourself ?
yes .
may you prosper !
mr. lorry followed sydney to the outer door , and , touching him on the shoulder as he was going away , caused him to turn .
i have no hope , said mr. lorry , in a low and sorrowful whisper .
nor have i .
if any one of these men , or all of these men , were disposed to spare himwhich is a large supposition ; for what is his life , or any man's to them !
idoubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court .
and so do i .
i heard the fall of the axe in that sound .
mr. lorry leaned his arm upon the doorpost , and bowed his face upon it .
don't despond , said carton , very gently ; don't grieve .
i encouraged doctor manette in this idea , because i felt that it might one day be consolatory to her .
otherwise , she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted ,' and that might trouble her .
yes , yes , yes , returned mr. lorry , drying his eyes , you are right .
but he will perish ; there is no real hope .
yes .
he will perish : there is no real hope , echoed carton .
and walked with a settled step , downstairs .
sydney carton paused in the street , not quite decided where to go .
at tellson's bankinghouse at nine , he said , with a musing face .
shall i do well , in the mean time , to show myself ?
i think so .
it is best that these people should know there is such a man as i here ; it is a sound precaution , and may be a necessary preparation .
but care , care , care !
let me think it out !
checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object , he took a turn or two in the already darkening street , and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences .
his first impression was confirmed .
it is best , he said , finally resolved , that these people should know there is such a man as i here .
and he turned his face towards saint antoine .
defarge had described himself , that day , as the keeper of a wineshop in the saint antoine suburb .
it was not difficult for one who knew the city well , to find his house without asking any question .
having ascertained its situation , carton came out of those closer streets again , and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner .
for the first time in many years , he had no strong drink .
since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine , and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on mr. lorry's hearth like a man who had done with it .
it was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed , and went out into the streets again .
as he passed along towards saint antoine , he stopped at a shopwindow where there was a mirror , and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat , and his coatcollar , and his wild hair .
this done , he went on direct to defarge's , and went in .
there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three , of the restless fingers and the croaking voice .
this man , whom he had seen upon the jury , stood drinking at the little counter , in conversation with the defarges , man and wife .
the vengeance assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment .
as carton walked in , took his seat and asked in very indifferent french for a small measure of wine , madame defarge cast a careless glance at him , and then a keener , and then a keener , and then advanced to him herself , and asked him what it was he had ordered .
he repeated what he had already said .
english ?
asked madame defarge , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows .
after looking at her , as if the sound of even a single french word were slow to express itself to him , he answered , in his former strong foreign accent .
yes , madame , yes .
i am english !
madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine , and , as he took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning , he heard her say , i swear to you , like evremonde !
defarge brought him the wine , and gave him good evening .
how ?
good evening .
oh !
good evening , citizen , filling his glass .
ah !
and good wine .
i drink to the republic .
defarge went back to the counter , and said , certainly , a little like .
madame sternly retorted , i tell you a good deal like .
jacques three pacifically remarked , he is so much in your mind , see you , madame .
the amiable vengeance added , with a laugh , yes , my faith !
and you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more tomorrow !
carton followed the lines and words of his paper , with a slow forefinger , and with a studious and absorbed face .
they were all leaning their arms on the counter close together , speaking low .
after a silence of a few moments , during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor , they resumed their conversation .
it is true what madame says , observed jacques three .
why stop ?
there is great force in that .
why stop ?
well , well , reasoned defarge , but one must stop somewhere .
after all , the question is still where ?
at extermination , said madame .
magnificent !
croaked jacques three .
the vengeance , also , highly approved .
extermination is good doctrine , my wife , said defarge , rather troubled ; in general , i say nothing against it .
but this doctor has suffered much ; you have seen him today ; you have observed his face when the paper was read .
i have observed his face !
repeated madame , contemptuously and angrily .
yes .
i have observed his face .
i have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the republic .
let him take care of his face !
and you have observed , my wife , said defarge , in a deprecatory manner , the anguish of his daughter , which must be a dreadful anguish to him !
i have observed his daughter , repeated madame ; yes , i have observed his daughter , more times than one .
i have observed her today , and i have observed her other days .
i have observed her in the court , and i have observed her in the street by the prison .
let me but lift my finger !
she seemed to raise it the listener's eyes were always on his paper , and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her , as if the axe had dropped .
the citizeness is superb !
croaked the juryman .
she is an angel !
said the vengeance , and embraced her .
as to thee , pursued madame , implacably , addressing her husband , if it depended on theewhich , happily , it does notthou wouldst rescue this man even now .
no !
protested defarge .
not if to lift this glass would do it !
but i would leave the matter there .
i say , stop there .
see you then , jacques , said madame defarge , wrathfully ; and see you , too , my little vengeance ; see you both !
listen !
for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors , i have this race a long time on my register , doomed to destruction and extermination .
ask my husband , is that so .
it is so , assented defarge , without being asked .
in the beginning of the great days , when the bastille falls , he finds this paper of today , and he brings it home , and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut , we read it , here on this spot , by the light of this lamp .
ask him , is that so .
it is so , assented defarge .
that night , i tell him , when the paper is read through , and the lamp is burnt out , and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars , that i have now a secret to communicate .
ask him , is that so .
it is so , assented defarge again .
i communicate to him that secret .
i smite this bosom with these two hands as i smite it now , and i tell him , 'defarge , i was brought up among the fishermen of the seashore , and that peasant family so injured by the two evremonde brothers , as that bastille paper describes , is my family .
defarge , that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister , that husband was my sister's husband , that unborn child was their child , that brother was my brother , that father was my father , those dead are my dead , and that summons to answer for those things descends to me !
'ask him , is that so .
it is so , assented defarge once more .
then tell wind and fire where to stop , returned madame ; but don't tell me .
both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wraththe listener could feel how white she was , without seeing herand both highly commended it .
defarge , a weak minority , interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis ; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply .
tell the wind and the fire where to stop ; not me !
customers entered , and the group was broken up .
the english customer paid for what he had had , perplexedly counted his change , and asked , as a stranger , to be directed towards the national palace .
madame defarge took him to the door , and put her arm on his , in pointing out the road .
the english customer was not without his reflections then , that it might be a good deed to seize that arm , lift it , and strike under it sharp and deep .
but , he went his way , and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall .
at the appointed hour , he emerged from it to present himself in mr. lorry's room again , where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety .
he said he had been with lucie until just now , and had only left her for a few minutes , to come and keep his appointment .
her father had not been seen , since he quitted the bankinghouse towards four o'clock .
she had some faint hopes that his mediation might save charles , but they were very slight .
he had been more than five hours gone : where could he be ?
mr. lorry waited until ten ; but , doctor manette not returning , and he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer , it was arranged that he should go back to her , and come to the bankinghouse again at midnight .
in the meanwhile , carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor .
he waited and waited , and the clock struck twelve ; but doctor manette did not come back .
mr. lorry returned , and found no tidings of him , and brought none .
where could he be ?
they were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs .
the instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost .
whether he had really been to any one , or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets , was never known .
as he stood staring at them , they asked him no question , for his face told them everything .
i cannot find it , said he , and i must have it .
where is it ?
his head and throat were bare , and , as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around , he took his coat off , and let it drop on the floor .
where is my bench ?
i have been looking everywhere for my bench , and i can't find it .
what have they done with my work ?
time presses : i must finish those shoes .
they looked at one another , and their hearts died within them .
come , come !
said he , in a whimpering miserable way ; let me get to work .
give me my work .
receiving no answer , he tore his hair , and beat his feet upon the ground , like a distracted child .
don't torture a poor forlorn wretch , he implored them , with a dreadful cry ; but give me my work !
what is to become of us , if those shoes are not done tonight ?
lost , utterly lost !
it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him , or try to restore him , thatas if by agreementthey each put a hand upon his shoulder , and soothed him to sit down before the fire , with a promise that he should have his work presently .
he sank into the chair , and brooded over the embers , and shed tears .
as if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy , or a dream , mr. lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping .
affected , and impressed with terror as they both were , by this spectacle of ruin , it was not a time to yield to such emotions .
his lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and reliance , appealed to them both too strongly .
again , as if by agreement , they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces .
carton was the first to speak : the last chance is gone : it was not much .
yes ; he had better be taken to her .
but , before you go , will you , for a moment , steadily attend to me ?
don't ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make , and exact the promise i am going to exact ; i have a reasona good one .
i do not doubt it , answered mr. lorry .
say on .
the figure in the chair between them , was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro , and moaning .
they spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sickbed in the night .
carton stooped to pick up the coat , which lay almost entangling his feet .
as he did so , a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day's duties , fell lightly on the floor .
carton took it up , and there was a folded paper in it .
we should look at this !
he said .
mr. lorry nodded his consent .
he opened it , and exclaimed , thank god !
what is it ?
asked mr. lorry , eagerly .
a moment !
let me speak of it in its place .
first , he put his hand in his coat , and took another paper from it , that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city .
look at it .
you seesydney carton , an englishman ?
mr. lorry held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face .
keep it for me until tomorrow .
i shall see him tomorrow , you remember , and i had better not take it into the prison .
why not ?
i don't know ; i prefer not to do so .
now , take this paper that doctor manette has carried about him .
it is a similar certificate , enabling him and his daughter and her child , at any time , to pass the barrier and the frontier !
you see ?
yes !
perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil , yesterday .
when is it dated ?
but no matter ; don't stay to look ; put it up carefully with mine and your own .
now , observe !
i never doubted until within this hour or two , that he had , or could have such a paper .
it is good , until recalled .
but it may be soon recalled , and , i have reason to think , will be .
they are not in danger ?
they are in great danger .
they are in danger of denunciation by madame defarge .
i know it from her own lips .
i have overheard words of that woman's , tonight , which have presented their danger to me in strong colours .
i have lost no time , and since then , i have seen the spy .
he confirms me .
he knows that a woodsawyer , living by the prison wall , is under the control of the defarges , and has been rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen herhe never mentioned lucie's namemaking signs and signals to prisoners .
it is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one , a prison plot , and that it will involve her lifeand perhaps her child'sand perhaps her father'sfor both have been seen with her at that place .
don't look so horrified .
you will save them all .
heaven grant i may , carton !
but how ?
i am going to tell you how .
it will depend on you , and it could depend on no better man .
this new denunciation will certainly not take place until after tomorrow ; probably not until two or three days afterwards ; more probably a week afterwards .
you know it is a capital crime , to mourn for , or sympathise with , a victim of the guillotine .
she and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime , and this woman the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described would wait to add that strength to her case , and make herself doubly sure .
you follow me ?
so attentively , and with so much confidence in what you say , that for the moment i lose sight , touching the back of the doctor's chair , even of this distress .
you have money , and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made .
your preparations have been completed for some days , to return to england .
early tomorrow have your horses ready , so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon .
it shall be done !
his manner was so fervent and inspiring , that mr. lorry caught the flame , and was as quick as youth .
you are a noble heart .
did i say we could depend upon no better man ?
tell her , tonight , what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father .
dwell upon that , for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband's cheerfully .
he faltered for an instant ; then went on as before .
for the sake of her child and her father , press upon her the necessity of leaving paris , with them and you , at that hour .
tell her that it was her husband's last arrangement .
tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe , or hope .
you think that her father , even in this sad state , will submit himself to her ; do you not ?
i am sure of it .
i thought so .
quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here , even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage .
the moment i come to you , take me in , and drive away .
i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances ?
you have my certificate in your hand with the rest , you know , and will reserve my place .
wait for nothing but to have my place occupied , and then for england !
why , then , said mr. lorry , grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand , it does not all depend on one old man , but i shall have a young and ardent man at my side .
by the help of heaven you shall !
promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another .
nothing , carton .
remember these words tomorrow : change the course , or delay in itfor any reasonand no life can possibly be saved , and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed .
i will remember them .
i hope to do my part faithfully .
and i hope to do mine .
now , good bye !
though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness , and though he even put the old man's hand to his lips , he did not part from him then .
he helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers , as to get a cloak and hat put upon it , and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have .
he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heartso happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to itoutwatched the awful night .
he entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone , looking up at the light in the window of her room .
before he went away , he breathed a blessing towards it , and a farewell .
in the black prison of the conciergerie , the doomed of the day awaited their fate .
they were in number as the weeks of the year .
fiftytwo were to roll that afternoon on the lifetide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea .
before their cells were quit of them , new occupants were appointed ; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday , the blood that was to mingle with theirs tomorrow was already set apart .
two score and twelve were told off .
from the farmergeneral of seventy , whose riches could not buy his life , to the seamstress of twenty , whose poverty and obscurity could not save her .
physical diseases , engendered in the vices and neglects of men , will seize on victims of all degrees ; and the frightful moral disorder , born of unspeakable suffering , intolerable oppression , and heartless indifference , smote equally without distinction .
charles darnay , alone in a cell , had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal .
in every line of the narrative he had heard , he had heard his condemnation .
he had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him , that he was virtually sentenced by the millions , and that units could avail him nothing .
nevertheless , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear .
his hold on life was strong , and it was very , very hard , to loosen ; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here , it clenched the tighter there ; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded , this was closed again .
there was a hurry , too , in all his thoughts , a turbulent and heated working of his heart , that contended against resignation .
if , for a moment , he did feel resigned , then his wife and child who had to live after him , seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing .
but , all this was at first .
before long , the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet , and that numbers went the same road wrongfully , and trod it firmly every day , sprang up to stimulate him .
next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones , depended on his quiet fortitude .
so , by degrees he calmed into the better state , when he could raise his thoughts much higher , and draw comfort down .
before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation , he had travelled thus far on his last way .
being allowed to purchase the means of writing , and a light , he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished .
he wrote a long letter to lucie , showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment , until he had heard of it from herself , and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery , until the paper had been read .
he had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished , was the one conditionfully intelligible nowthat her father had attached to their betrothal , and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage .
he entreated her , for her father's sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him for the moment , or for good , by the story of the tower , on that old sunday under the dear old planetree in the garden .
if he had preserved any definite remembrance of it , there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille , when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there , and which had been described to all the world .
he besought herthough he added that he knew it was needlessto console her father , by impressing him through every tender means she could think of , with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself , but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes .
next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing , and her overcoming of her sorrow , to devote herself to their dear child , he adjured her , as they would meet in heaven , to comfort her father .
to her father himself , he wrote in the same strain ; but , he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care .
and he told him this , very strongly , with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending .
to mr. lorry , he commended them all , and explained his worldly affairs .
that done , with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment , all was done .
he never thought of carton .
his mind was so full of the others , that he never once thought of him .
he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out .
when he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world .
but , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms .
free and happy , back in the old house in soho though it had nothing in it like the real house , unaccountably released and light of heart , he was with lucie again , and she told him it was all a dream , and he had never gone away .
a pause of forgetfulness , and then he had even suffered , and had come back to her , dead and at peace , and yet there was no difference in him .
another pause of oblivion , and he awoke in the sombre morning , unconscious where he was or what had happened , until it flashed upon his mind , this is the day of my death !
thus , had he come through the hours , to the day when the fiftytwo heads were to fall .
and now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , a new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master .
he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life .
how high it was from the ground , how many steps it had , where he would be stood , how he would be touched , whether the touching hands would be dyed red , which way his face would be turned , whether he would be the first , or might be the last : these and many similar questions , in nowise directed by his will , obtruded themselves over and over again , countless times .
neither were they connected with fear : he was conscious of no fear .
rather , they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came ; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred ; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his , than his own .
the hours went on as he walked to and fro , and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again .
nine gone for ever , ten gone for ever , eleven gone for ever , twelve coming on to pass away .
after a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him , he had got the better of it .
he walked up and down , softly repeating their names to himself .
the worst of the strife was over .
he could walk up and down , free from distracting fancies , praying for himself and for them .
twelve gone for ever .
he had been apprised that the final hour was three , and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier , inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets .
therefore , he resolved to keep two before his mind , as the hour , and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able , after that time , to strengthen others .
walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast , a very different man from the prisoner , who had walked to and fro at la force , he heard one struck away from him , without surprise .
the hour had measured like most other hours .
devoutly thankful to heaven for his recovered selfpossession , he thought , there is but another now , and turned to walk again .
footsteps in the stone passage outside the door .
he stopped .
the key was put in the lock , and turned .
before the door was opened , or as it opened , a man said in a low voice , in english : he has never seen me here ; i have kept out of his way .
go you in alone ; i wait near .
lose no time !
the door was quickly opened and closed , and there stood before him face to face , quiet , intent upon him , with the light of a smile on his features , and a cautionary finger on his lip , sydney carton .
there was something so bright and remarkable in his look , that , for the first moment , the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining .
but , he spoke , and it was his voice ; he took the prisoner's hand , and it was his real grasp .
of all the people upon earth , you least expected to see me ?
he said .
i could not believe it to be you .
i can scarcely believe it now .
you are notthe apprehension came suddenly into his minda prisoner ?
no .
i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here , and in virtue of it i stand before you .
i come from heryour wife , dear darnay .
the prisoner wrung his hand .
i bring you a request from her .
what is it ?
a most earnest , pressing , and emphatic entreaty , addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you , that you well remember .
the prisoner turned his face partly aside .
you have no time to ask me why i bring it , or what it means ; i have no time to tell you .
you must comply with ittake off those boots you wear , and draw on these of mine .
there was a chair against the wall of the cell , behind the prisoner .
carton , pressing forward , had already , with the speed of lightning , got him down into it , and stood over him , barefoot .
draw on these boots of mine .
put your hands to them ; put your will to them .
quick !
carton , there is no escaping from this place ; it never can be done .
you will only die with me .
it is madness .
it would be madness if i asked you to escape ; but do i ?
when i ask you to pass out at that door , tell me it is madness and remain here .
change that cravat for this of mine , that coat for this of mine .
while you do it , let me take this ribbon from your hair , and shake out your hair like this of mine !
with wonderful quickness , and with a strength both of will and action , that appeared quite supernatural , he forced all these changes upon him .
the prisoner was like a young child in his hands .
carton !
dear carton !
it is madness .
it cannot be accomplished , it never can be done , it has been attempted , and has always failed .
i implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine .
do i ask you , my dear darnay , to pass the door ?
when i ask that , refuse .
there are pen and ink and paper on this table .
is your hand steady enough to write ?
it was when you came in .
steady it again , and write what i shall dictate .
quick , friend , quick !
pressing his hand to his bewildered head , darnay sat down at the table .
carton , with his right hand in his breast , stood close beside him .
write exactly as i speak .
to whom do i address it ?
to no one .
carton still had his hand in his breast .
do i date it ?
no .
the prisoner looked up , at each question .
carton , standing over him with his hand in his breast , looked down .
'if you remember ,' said carton , dictating , 'the words that passed between us , long ago , you will readily comprehend this when you see it .
you do remember them , i know .
it is not in your nature to forget them .
'he was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something .
have you written 'forget them' ?
carton asked .
i have .
is that a weapon in your hand ?
no ; i am not armed .
what is it in your hand ?
you shall know directly .
write on ; there are but a few words more .
he dictated again .
'i am thankful that the time has come , when i can prove them .
that i do so is no subject for regret or grief .
'as he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer , his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face .
the pen dropped from darnay's fingers on the table , and he looked about him vacantly .
what vapour is that ?
he asked .
vapour ?
something that crossed me ?
i am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here .
take up the pen and finish .
hurry , hurry !
as if his memory were impaired , or his faculties disordered , the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention .
as he looked at carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing , cartonhis hand again in his breastlooked steadily at him .
hurry , hurry !
the prisoner bent over the paper , once more .
'if it had been otherwise ;' carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down ; 'i never should have used the longer opportunity .
if it had been otherwise ;' the hand was at the prisoner's face ; 'i should but have had so much the more to answer for .
if it had been otherwise' carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs .
carton's hand moved back to his breast no more .
the prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look , but carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and carton's left arm caught him round the waist .
for a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him ; but , within a minute or so , he was stretched insensible on the ground .
quickly , but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was , carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside , combed back his hair , and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn .
then , he softly called , enter there !
come in !
and the spy presented himself .
you see ?
said carton , looking up , as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure , putting the paper in the breast : is your hazard very great ?
mr .
carton , the spy answered , with a timid snap of his fingers , my hazard is not that , in the thick of business here , if you are true to the whole of your bargain .
don't fear me .
i will be true to the death .
you must be , mr. carton , if the tale of fiftytwo is to be right .
being made right by you in that dress , i shall have no fear .
have no fear !
i shall soon be out of the way of harming you , and the rest will soon be far from here , please god !
now , get assistance and take me to the coach .
you ?
said the spy nervously .
him , man , with whom i have exchanged .
you go out at the gate by which you brought me in ?
of course .
i was weak and faint when you brought me in , and i am fainter now you take me out .
the parting interview has overpowered me .
such a thing has happened here , often , and too often .
your life is in your own hands .
quick !
call assistance !
you swear not to betray me ?
said the trembling spy , as he paused for a last moment .
man , man !
returned carton , stamping his foot ; have i sworn by no solemn vow already , to go through with this , that you waste the precious moments now ?
take him yourself to the courtyard you know of , place him yourself in the carriage , show him yourself to mr. lorry , tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air , and to remember my words of last night , and his promise of last night , and drive away !
the spy withdrew , and carton seated himself at the table , resting his forehead on his hands .
the spy returned immediately , with two men .
how , then ?
said one of them , contemplating the fallen figure .
so afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of sainte guillotine ?
a good patriot , said the other , could hardly have been more afflicted if the aristocrat had drawn a blank .
they raised the unconscious figure , placed it on a litter they had brought to the door , and bent to carry it away .
the time is short , evremonde , said the spy , in a warning voice .
i know it well , answered carton .
be careful of my friend , i entreat you , and leave me .
come , then , my children , said barsad .
lift him , and come away !
the door closed , and carton was left alone .
straining his powers of listening to the utmost , he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm .
there was none .
keys turned , doors clashed , footsteps passed along distant passages : no cry was raised , or hurry made , that seemed unusual .
breathing more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck two .
sounds that he was not afraid of , for he divined their meaning , then began to be audible .
several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own .
a gaoler , with a list in his hand , looked in , merely saying , follow me , evremonde !
and he followed into a large dark room , at a distance .
it was a dark winter day , and what with the shadows within , and what with the shadows without , he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound .
some were standing ; some seated .
some were lamenting , and in restless motion ; but , these were few .
the great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground .
as he stood by the wall in a dim corner , while some of the fiftytwo were brought in after him , one man stopped in passing , to embrace him , as having a knowledge of him .
it thrilled him with a great dread of discovery ; but the man went on .
a very few moments after that , a young woman , with a slight girlish form , a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour , and large widely opened patient eyes , rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting , and came to speak to him .
citizen evremonde , she said , touching him with her cold hand .
i am a poor little seamstress , who was with you in la force .
he murmured for answer : true .
i forget what you were accused of ?
plots .
though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any .
is it likely ?
who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me ?
the forlorn smile with which she said it , so touched him , that tears started from his eyes .
i am not afraid to die , citizen evremonde , but i have done nothing .
i am not unwilling to die , if the republic which is to do so much good to us poor , will profit by my death ; but i do not know how that can be , citizen evremonde .
such a poor weak little creature !
as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl .
i heard you were released , citizen evremonde .
i hoped it was true ?
it was .
but , i was again taken and condemned .
if i may ride with you , citizen evremonde , will you let me hold your hand ?
i am not afraid , but i am little and weak , and it will give me more courage .
as the patient eyes were lifted to his face , he saw a sudden doubt in them , and then astonishment .
he pressed the workworn , hungerworn young fingers , and touched his lips .
are you dying for him ?
she whispered .
and his wife and child .
hush !
yes .
o you will let me hold your brave hand , stranger ?
hush !
yes , my poor sister ; to the last .
the same shadows that are falling on the prison , are falling , in that same hour of the early afternoon , on the barrier with the crowd about it , when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined .
who goes here ?
whom have we within ?
papers !
the papers are handed out , and read .
alexandre manette .
physician .
french .
which is he ?
this is he ; this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out .
apparently the citizendoctor is not in his right mind ?
the revolutionfever will have been too much for him ?
greatly too much for him .
hah !
many suffer with it .
lucie .
his daughter .
french .
which is she ?
this is she .
apparently it must be .
lucie , the wife of evremonde ; is it not ?
it is .
hah !
evremonde has an assignation elsewhere .
lucie , her child .
english .
this is she ?
she and no other .
kiss me , child of evremonde .
now , thou hast kissed a good republican ; something new in thy family ; remember it !
sydney carton .
advocate .
english .
which is he ?
he lies here , in this corner of the carriage .
he , too , is pointed out .
apparently the english advocate is in a swoon ?
it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air .
it is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the republic .
is that all ?
it is not a great deal , that !
many are under the displeasure of the republic , and must look out at the little window .
jarvis lorry .
banker .
english .
which is he ?
i am he .
necessarily , being the last .
it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions .
it is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door , replying to a group of officials .
they leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box , to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof ; the countrypeople hanging about , press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in ; a little child , carried by its mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine .
behold your papers , jarvis lorry , countersigned .
one can depart , citizen ?
one can depart .
forward , my postilions !
a good journey !
i salute you , citizens .
andthe first danger passed !
these are again the words of jarvis lorry , as he clasps his hands , and looks upward .
there is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller .
are we not going too slowly ?
can they not be induced to go faster ?
asks lucie , clinging to the old man .
it would seem like flight , my darling .
i must not urge them too much ; it would rouse suspicion .
look back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
the road is clear , my dearest .
so far , we are not pursued .
houses in twos and threes pass by us , solitary farms , ruinous buildings , dyeworks , tanneries , and the like , open country , avenues of leafless trees .
the hard uneven pavement is under us , the soft deep mud is on either side .
sometimes , we strike into the skirting mud , to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us ; sometimes , we stick in ruts and sloughs there .
the agony of our impatience is then so great , that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and runninghidingdoing anything but stopping .
out of the open country , in again among ruinous buildings , solitary farms , dyeworks , tanneries , and the like , cottages in twos and threes , avenues of leafless trees .
have these men deceived us , and taken us back by another road ?
is not this the same place twice over ?
thank heaven , no .
a village .
look back , look back , and see if we are pursued !
hush !
the postinghouse .
leisurely , our four horses are taken out ; leisurely , the coach stands in the little street , bereft of horses , and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again ; leisurely , the new horses come into visible existence , one by one ; leisurely , the new postilions follow , sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips ; leisurely , the old postilions count their money , make wrong additions , and arrive at dissatisfied results .
all the time , our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled .
at length the new postilions are in their saddles , and the old are left behind .
we are through the village , up the hill , and down the hill , and on the low watery grounds .
suddenly , the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation , and the horses are pulled up , almost on their haunches .
we are pursued ?
ho !
within the carriage there .
speak then !
what is it ?
asks mr. lorry , looking out at window .
how many did they say ?
i do not understand you .
at the last post .
how many to the guillotine today ?
fiftytwo .
i said so !
a brave number !
my fellowcitizen here would have it fortytwo ; ten more heads are worth having .
the guillotine goes handsomely .
i love it .
hi forward .
whoop !
the night comes on dark .
he moves more ; he is beginning to revive , and to speak intelligibly ; he thinks they are still together ; he asks him , by his name , what he has in his hand .
o pity us , kind heaven , and help us !
look out , look out , and see if we are pursued .
the wind is rushing after us , and the clouds are flying after us , and the moon is plunging after us , and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us ; but , so far , we are pursued by nothing else .
in that same juncture of time when the fiftytwo awaited their fate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and jacques three of the revolutionary jury .
not in the wineshop did madame defarge confer with these ministers , but in the shed of the woodsawyer , erst a mender of roads .
the sawyer himself did not participate in the conference , but abided at a little distance , like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required , or to offer an opinion until invited .
but our defarge , said jacques three , is undoubtedly a good republican ?
eh ?
there is no better , the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill notes , in france .
peace , little vengeance , said madame defarge , laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips , hear me speak .
my husband , fellowcitizen , is a good republican and a bold man ; he has deserved well of the republic , and possesses its confidence .
but my husband has his weaknesses , and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor .
it is a great pity , croaked jacques three , dubiously shaking his head , with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth ; it is not quite like a good citizen ; it is a thing to regret .
see you , said madame , i care nothing for this doctor , i .
he may wear his head or lose it , for any interest i have in him ; it is all one to me .
but , the evremonde people are to be exterminated , and the wife and child must follow the husband and father .
she has a fine head for it , croaked jacques three .
i have seen blue eyes and golden hair there , and they looked charming when samson held them up .
ogre that he was , he spoke like an epicure .
madame defarge cast down her eyes , and reflected a little .
the child also , observed jacques three , with a meditative enjoyment of his words , has golden hair and blue eyes .
and we seldom have a child there .
it is a pretty sight !
in a word , said madame defarge , coming out of her short abstraction , i cannot trust my husband in this matter .
not only do i feel , since last night , that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects ; but also i feel that if i delay , there is danger of his giving warning , and then they might escape .
that must never be , croaked jacques three ; no one must escape .
we have not half enough as it is .
we ought to have six score a day .
in a word , madame defarge went on , my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation , and i have not his reason for regarding this doctor with any sensibility .
i must act for myself , therefore .
come hither , little citizen .
the woodsawyer , who held her in the respect , and himself in the submission , of mortal fear , advanced with his hand to his red cap .
touching those signals , little citizen , said madame defarge , sternly , that she made to the prisoners ; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day ?
ay , ay , why not !
cried the sawyer .
every day , in all weathers , from two to four , always signalling , sometimes with the little one , sometimes without .
i know what i know .
i have seen with my eyes .
he made all manner of gestures while he spoke , as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen .
clearly plots , said jacques three .
transparently !
there is no doubt of the jury ?
inquired madame defarge , letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile .
rely upon the patriotic jury , dear citizeness .
i answer for my fellowjurymen .
now , let me see , said madame defarge , pondering again .
yet once more !
can i spare this doctor to my husband ?
i have no feeling either way .
can i spare him ?
he would count as one head , observed jacques three , in a low voice .
we really have not heads enough ; it would be a pity , i think .
he was signalling with her when i saw her , argued madame defarge ; i cannot speak of one without the other ; and i must not be silent , and trust the case wholly to him , this little citizen here .
for , i am not a bad witness .
the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses .
the little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness .
he must take his chance , said madame defarge .
no , i cannot spare him !
you are engaged at three o'clock ; you are going to see the batch of today executed .
you ?
the question was addressed to the woodsawyer , who hurriedly replied in the affirmative : seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of republicans , and that he would be in effect the most desolate of republicans , if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber .
he was so very demonstrative herein , that he might have been suspected perhaps was , by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of madame defarge's head of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety , every hour in the day .
i , said madame , am equally engaged at the same place .
after it is oversay at eight tonightcome you to me , in saint antoine , and we will give information against these people at my section .
the woodsawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness .
the citizeness looking at him , he became embarrassed , evaded her glance as a small dog would have done , retreated among his wood , and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw .
madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to the door , and there expounded her further views to them thus : she will now be at home , awaiting the moment of his death .
she will be mourning and grieving .
she will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the republic .
she will be full of sympathy with its enemies .
i will go to her .
what an admirable woman ; what an adorable woman !
exclaimed jacques three , rapturously .
ah , my cherished !
cried the vengeance ; and embraced her .
take you my knitting , said madame defarge , placing it in her lieutenant's hands , and have it ready for me in my usual seat .
keep me my usual chair .
go you there , straight , for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual , today .
i willingly obey the orders of my chief , said the vengeance with alacrity , and kissing her cheek .
you will not be late ?
i shall be there before the commencement .
and before the tumbrils arrive .
be sure you are there , my soul , said the vengeance , calling after her , for she had already turned into the street , before the tumbrils arrive !
madame defarge slightly waved her hand , to imply that she heard , and might be relied upon to arrive in good time , and so went through the mud , and round the corner of the prison wall .
the vengeance and the juryman , looking after her as she walked away , were highly appreciative of her fine figure , and her superb moral endowments .
there were many women at that time , upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand ; but , there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman , now taking her way along the streets .
of a strong and fearless character , of shrewd sense and readiness , of great determination , of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity , but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities ; the troubled time would have heaved her up , under any circumstances .
but , imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong , and an inveterate hatred of a class , opportunity had developed her into a tigress .
she was absolutely without pity .
if she had ever had the virtue in her , it had quite gone out of her .
it was nothing to her , that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers ; she saw , not him , but them .
it was nothing to her , that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan ; that was insufficient punishment , because they were her natural enemies and her prey , and as such had no right to live .
to appeal to her , was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity , even for herself .
if she had been laid low in the streets , in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged , she would not have pitied herself ; nor , if she had been ordered to the axe tomorrow , would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there .
such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe .
carelessly worn , it was a becoming robe enough , in a certain weird way , and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap .
lying hidden in her bosom , was a loaded pistol .
lying hidden at her waist , was a sharpened dagger .
thus accoutred , and walking with the confident tread of such a character , and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood , barefoot and barelegged , on the brown seasand , madame defarge took her way along the streets .
now , when the journey of the travelling coach , at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load , had been planned out last night , the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr. lorry's attention .
it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach , but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers , should be reduced to the utmost ; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there .
finally , he had proposed , after anxious consideration , that miss pross and jerry , who were at liberty to leave the city , should leave it at three o'clock in the lightestwheeled conveyance known to that period .
unencumbered with luggage , they would soon overtake the coach , and , passing it and preceding it on the road , would order its horses in advance , and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night , when delay was the most to be dreaded .
seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency , miss pross hailed it with joy .
she and jerry had beheld the coach start , had known who it was that solomon brought , had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense , and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach , even as madame defarge , taking her way through the streets , now drew nearer and nearer to the elsedeserted lodging in which they held their consultation .
now what do you think , mr. cruncher , said miss pross , whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak , or stand , or move , or live : what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard ?
another carriage having already gone from here today , it might awaken suspicion .
my opinion , miss , returned mr. cruncher , is as you're right .
likewise wot i'll stand by you , right or wrong .
i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures , said miss pross , wildly crying , that i am incapable of forming any plan .
are you capable of forming any plan , my dear good mr. cruncher ?
respectin' a future spear o' life , miss , returned mr. cruncher , i hope so .
respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine , i think not .
would you do me the favour , miss , to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis ?
oh , for gracious sake !
cried miss pross , still wildly crying , record them at once , and get them out of the way , like an excellent man .
first , said mr. cruncher , who was all in a tremble , and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage , them poor things well out o' this , never no more will i do it , never no more !
i am quite sure , mr. cruncher , returned miss pross , that you never will do it again , whatever it is , and i beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is .
no , miss , returned jerry , it shall not be named to you .
second : them poor things well out o' this , and never no more will i interfere with mrs. cruncher's flopping , never no more !
whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be , said miss pross , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , i have no doubt it is best that mrs. cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence .
omy poor darlings !
i go so far as to say , miss , moreover , proceeded mr. cruncher , with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpitand let my words be took down and took to mrs. cruncher through yourselfthat wot my opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change , and that wot i only hope with all my heart as mrs. cruncher may be a flopping at the present time .
there , there , there !
i hope she is , my dear man , cried the distracted miss pross , and i hope she finds it answering her expectations .
forbid it , proceeded mr. cruncher , with additional solemnity , additional slowness , and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out , as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now !
forbid it as we shouldn't all flop if it was anyways conwenient to get 'em out o' this here dismal risk !
forbid it , miss !
wot i say , forbid it !
this was mr. cruncher's conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one .
and still madame defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
if we ever get back to our native land , said miss pross , you may rely upon my telling mrs. cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said ; and at all events you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time .
now , pray let us think !
my esteemed mr. cruncher , let us think !
still , madame defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
if you were to go before , said miss pross , and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here , and were to wait somewhere for me ; wouldn't that be best ?
mr. cruncher thought it might be best .
where could you wait for me ?
asked miss pross .
mr. cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but temple bar .
alas !
temple bar was hundreds of miles away , and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed .
by the cathedral door , said miss pross .
would it be much out of the way , to take me in , near the great cathedral door between the two towers ?
no , miss , answered mr. cruncher .
then , like the best of men , said miss pross , go to the postinghouse straight , and make that change .
i am doubtful , said mr. cruncher , hesitating and shaking his head , about leaving of you , you see .
we don't know what may happen .
heaven knows we don't , returned miss pross , but have no fear for me .
take me in at the cathedral , at three o'clock , or as near it as you can , and i am sure it will be better than our going from here .
i feel certain of it .
there !
bless you , mr. cruncher !
thinknot of me , but of the lives that may depend on both of us !
this exordium , and miss pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his , decided mr. cruncher .
with an encouraging nod or two , he immediately went out to alter the arrangements , and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed .
the having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution , was a great relief to miss pross .
the necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets , was another relief .
she looked at her watch , and it was twenty minutes past two .
she had no time to lose , but must get ready at once .
afraid , in her extreme perturbation , of the loneliness of the deserted rooms , and of halfimagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them , miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes , which were swollen and red .
haunted by her feverish apprehensions , she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water , but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her .
in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out , for she saw a figure standing in the room .
the basin fell to the ground broken , and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge .
by strange stern ways , and through much staining blood , those feet had come to meet that water .
madame defarge looked coldly at her , and said , the wife of evremonde ; where is she ?
it flashed upon miss pross's mind that the doors were all standing open , and would suggest the flight .
her first act was to shut them .
there were four in the room , and she shut them all .
she then placed herself before the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied .
madame defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement , and rested on her when it was finished .
miss pross had nothing beautiful about her ; years had not tamed the wildness , or softened the grimness , of her appearance ; but , she too was a determined woman in her different way , and she measured madame defarge with her eyes , every inch .
you might , from your appearance , be the wife of lucifer , said miss pross , in her breathing .
nevertheless , you shall not get the better of me .
i am an englishwoman .
madame defarge looked at her scornfully , but still with something of miss pross's own perception that they two were at bay .
she saw a tight , hard , wiry woman before her , as mr. lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand , in the years gone by .
she knew full well that miss pross was the family's devoted friend ; miss pross knew full well that madame defarge was the family's malevolent enemy .
on my way yonder , said madame defarge , with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot , where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me , i am come to make my compliments to her in passing .
i wish to see her .
i know that your intentions are evil , said miss pross , and you may depend upon it , i'll hold my own against them .
each spoke in her own language ; neither understood the other's words ; both were very watchful , and intent to deduce from look and manner , what the unintelligible words meant .
it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment , said madame defarge .
good patriots will know what that means .
let me see her .
go tell her that i wish to see her .
do you hear ?
if those eyes of yours were bedwinches , returned miss pross , and i was an english fourposter , they shouldn't loose a splinter of me .
no , you wicked foreign woman ; i am your match .
madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail ; but , she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught .
woman imbecile and piglike !
said madame defarge , frowning .
i take no answer from you .
i demand to see her .
either tell her that i demand to see her , or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her !
this , with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm .
i little thought , said miss pross , that i should ever want to understand your nonsensical language ; but i would give all i have , except the clothes i wear , to know whether you suspect the truth , or any part of it .
neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes .
madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her ; but , she now advanced one step .
i am a briton , said miss pross , i am desperate .
i don't care an english twopence for myself .
i know that the longer i keep you here , the greater hope there is for my ladybird .
i'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head , if you lay a finger on me !
thus miss pross , with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence , and every rapid sentence a whole breath .
thus miss pross , who had never struck a blow in her life .
but , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes .
this was a courage that madame defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness .
ha , ha !
she laughed , you poor wretch !
what are you worth !
i address myself to that doctor .
then she raised her voice and called out , citizen doctor !
wife of evremonde !
child of evremonde !
any person but this miserable fool , answer the citizeness defarge !
perhaps the following silence , perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of miss pross's face , perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion , whispered to madame defarge that they were gone .
three of the doors she opened swiftly , and looked in .
those rooms are all in disorder , there has been hurried packing , there are odds and ends upon the ground .
there is no one in that room behind you !
let me look .
never !
said miss pross , who understood the request as perfectly as madame defarge understood the answer .
if they are not in that room , they are gone , and can be pursued and brought back , said madame defarge to herself .
as long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not , you are uncertain what to do , said miss pross to herself ; and you shall not know that , if i can prevent your knowing it ; and know that , or not know that , you shall not leave here while i can hold you .
i have been in the streets from the first , nothing has stopped me , i will tear you to pieces , but i will have you from that door , said madame defarge .
we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard , we are not likely to be heard , and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here , while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling , said miss pross .
madame defarge made at the door .
miss pross , on the instinct of the moment , seized her round the waist in both her arms , and held her tight .
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike ; miss pross , with the vigorous tenacity of love , always so much stronger than hate , clasped her tight , and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had .
the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her face ; but , miss pross , with her head down , held her round the waist , and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman .
soon , madame defarge's hands ceased to strike , and felt at her encircled waist .
it is under my arm , said miss pross , in smothered tones , you shall not draw it .
i am stronger than you , i bless heaven for it .
i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies !
madame defarge's hands were at her bosom .
miss pross looked up , saw what it was , struck at it , struck out a flash and a crash , and stood aloneblinded with smoke .
all this was in a second .
as the smoke cleared , leaving an awful stillness , it passed out on the air , like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground .
in the first fright and horror of her situation , miss pross passed the body as far from it as she could , and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help .
happily , she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did , in time to check herself and go back .
it was dreadful to go in at the door again ; but , she did go in , and even went near it , to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear .
these she put on , out on the staircase , first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key .
she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry , and then got up and hurried away .
by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet , or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped .
by good fortune , too , she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman .
she needed both advantages , for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face , and her hair was torn , and her dress hastily composed with unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a hundred ways .
in crossing the bridge , she dropped the door key in the river .
arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort , and waiting there , she thought , what if the key were already taken in a net , what if it were identified , what if the door were opened and the remains discovered , what if she were stopped at the gate , sent to prison , and charged with murder !
in the midst of these fluttering thoughts , the escort appeared , took her in , and took her away .
is there any noise in the streets ?
she asked him .
the usual noises , mr. cruncher replied ; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect .
i don't hear you , said miss pross .
what do you say ?
it was in vain for mr. cruncher to repeat what he said ; miss pross could not hear him .
so i'll nod my head , thought mr. cruncher , amazed , at all events she'll see that .
and she did .
is there any noise in the streets now ?
asked miss pross again , presently .
again mr. cruncher nodded his head .
i don't hear it .
gone deaf in an hour ?
said mr. cruncher , ruminating , with his mind much disturbed ; wot's come to her ?
i feel , said miss pross , as if there had been a flash and a crash , and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life .
blest if she ain't in a queer condition !
said mr. cruncher , more and more disturbed .
wot can she have been a takin' , to keep her courage up ?
hark !
there's the roll of them dreadful carts !
you can hear that , miss ?
i can hear , said miss pross , seeing that he spoke to her , nothing .
o , my good man , there was first a great crash , and then a great stillness , and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable , never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts .
if she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts , now very nigh their journey's end , said mr. cruncher , glancing over his shoulder , it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world .
and indeed she never did .
along the paris streets , the deathcarts rumble , hollow and harsh .
six tumbrils carry the day's wine to la guillotine .
all the devouring and insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself , are fused in the one realisation , guillotine .
and yet there is not in france , with its rich variety of soil and climate , a blade , a leaf , a root , a sprig , a peppercorn , which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror .
crush humanity out of shape once more , under similar hammers , and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms .
sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again , and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind .
six tumbrils roll along the streets .
change these back again to what they were , thou powerful enchanter , time , and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs , the equipages of feudal nobles , the toilettes of flaring jezebels , the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves , the huts of millions of starving peasants !
no ; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the creator , never reverses his transformations .
if thou be changed into this shape by the will of god , say the seers to the enchanted , in the wise arabian stories , then remain so !
but , if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration , then resume thy former aspect !
changeless and hopeless , the tumbrils roll along .
as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round , they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets .
ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that , and the ploughs go steadily onward .
so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle , that in many windows there are no people , and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended , while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils .
here and there , the inmate has visitors to see the sight ; then he points his finger , with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent , to this cart and to this , and seems to tell who sat here yesterday , and who there the day before .
of the riders in the tumbrils , some observe these things , and all things on their last roadside , with an impassive stare ; others , with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men .
some , seated with drooping heads , are sunk in silent despair ; again , there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres , and in pictures .
several close their eyes , and think , or try to get their straying thoughts together .
only one , and he a miserable creature , of a crazed aspect , is so shattered and made drunk by horror , that he sings , and tries to dance .
not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture , to the pity of the people .
there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils , and faces are often turned up to some of them , and they are asked some question .
it would seem to be always the same question , for , it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart .
the horsemen abreast of that cart , frequently point out one man in it with their swords .
the leading curiosity is , to know which is he ; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down , to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart , and holds his hand .
he has no curiosity or care for the scene about him , and always speaks to the girl .
here and there in the long street of st .
honore , cries are raised against him .
if they move him at all , it is only to a quiet smile , as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face .
he cannot easily touch his face , his arms being bound .
on the steps of a church , awaiting the comingup of the tumbrils , stands the spy and prisonsheep .
he looks into the first of them : not there .
he looks into the second : not there .
he already asks himself , has he sacrificed me ?
when his face clears , as he looks into the third .
which is evremonde ?
says a man behind him .
that .
at the back there .
with his hand in the girl's ?
yes .
the man cries , down , evremonde !
to the guillotine all aristocrats !
down , evremonde !
hush , hush !
the spy entreats him , timidly .
and why not , citizen ?
he is going to pay the forfeit : it will be paid in five minutes more .
let him be at peace .
but the man continuing to exclaim , down , evremonde !
the face of evremonde is for a moment turned towards him .
evremonde then sees the spy , and looks attentively at him , and goes his way .
the clocks are on the stroke of three , and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round , to come on into the place of execution , and end .
the ridges thrown to this side and to that , now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on , for all are following to the guillotine .
in front of it , seated in chairs , as in a garden of public diversion , are a number of women , busily knitting .
on one of the foremost chairs , stands the vengeance , looking about for her friend .
therese !
she cries , in her shrill tones .
who has seen her ?
therese defarge !
she never missed before , says a knittingwoman of the sisterhood .
no ; nor will she miss now , cries the vengeance , petulantly .
therese .
louder , the woman recommends .
ay !
louder , vengeance , much louder , and still she will scarcely hear thee .
louder yet , vengeance , with a little oath or so added , and yet it will hardly bring her .
send other women up and down to seek her , lingering somewhere ; and yet , although the messengers have done dread deeds , it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her !
bad fortune !
cries the vengeance , stamping her foot in the chair , and here are the tumbrils !
and evremonde will be despatched in a wink , and she not here !
see her knitting in my hand , and her empty chair ready for her .
i cry with vexation and disappointment !
as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it , the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads .
the ministers of sainte guillotine are robed and ready .
crash !
ahead is held up , and the knittingwomen who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak , count one .
the second tumbril empties and moves on ; the third comes up .
crash !
andthe knittingwomen , never faltering or pausing in their work , count two .
the supposed evremonde descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him .
he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out , but still holds it as he promised .
he gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls , and she looks into his face and thanks him .
but for you , dear stranger , i should not be so composed , for i am naturally a poor little thing , faint of heart ; nor should i have been able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death , that we might have hope and comfort here today .
i think you were sent to me by heaven .
or you to me , says sydney carton .
keep your eyes upon me , dear child , and mind no other object .
i mind nothing while i hold your hand .
i shall mind nothing when i let it go , if they are rapid .
they will be rapid .
fear not !
the two stand in the fastthinning throng of victims , but they speak as if they were alone .
eye to eye , voice to voice , hand to hand , heart to heart , these two children of the universal mother , else so wide apart and differing , have come together on the dark highway , to repair home together , and to rest in her bosom .
brave and generous friend , will you let me ask you one last question ?
i am very ignorant , and it troubles mejust a little .
tell me what it is .
i have a cousin , an only relative and an orphan , like myself , whom i love very dearly .
she is five years younger than i , and she lives in a farmer's house in the south country .
poverty parted us , and she knows nothing of my fatefor i cannot writeand if i could , how should i tell her !
it is better as it is .
yes , yes : better as it is .
what i have been thinking as we came along , and what i am still thinking now , as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support , is this :if the republic really does good to the poor , and they come to be less hungry , and in all ways to suffer less , she may live a long time : she may even live to be old .
what then , my gentle sister ?
do you think : the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance , fill with tears , and the lips part a little more and tremble : that it will seem long to me , while i wait for her in the better land where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered ?
it cannot be , my child ; there is no time there , and no trouble there .
you comfort me so much !
i am so ignorant .
am i to kiss you now ?
is the moment come ?
yes .
she kisses his lips ; he kisses hers ; they solemnly bless each other .
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it ; nothing worse than a sweet , bright constancy is in the patient face .
she goes next before himis gone ; the knittingwomen count twentytwo .
i am the resurrection and the life , saith the lord : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die .
the murmuring of many voices , the upturning of many faces , the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd , so that it swells forward in a mass , like one great heave of water , all flashes away .
twentythree .
they said of him , about the city that night , that it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there .
many added that he looked sublime and prophetic .
one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad asked at the foot of the same scaffold , not long before , to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her .
if he had given any utterance to his , and they were prophetic , they would have been these : i see barsad , and cly , defarge , the vengeance , the juryman , the judge , long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old , perishing by this retributive instrument , before it shall cease out of its present use .
i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss , and , in their struggles to be truly free , in their triumphs and defeats , through long years to come , i see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth , gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out .
i see the lives for which i lay down my life , peaceful , useful , prosperous and happy , in that england which i shall see no more .
i see her with a child upon her bosom , who bears my name .
i see her father , aged and bent , but otherwise restored , and faithful to all men in his healing office , and at peace .
i see the good old man , so long their friend , in ten years' time enriching them with all he has , and passing tranquilly to his reward .
i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts , and in the hearts of their descendants , generations hence .
i see her , an old woman , weeping for me on the anniversary of this day .
i see her and her husband , their course done , lying side by side in their last earthly bed , and i know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul , than i was in the souls of both .
i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name , a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine .
i see him winning it so well , that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his .
i see the blots i threw upon it , faded away .
i see him , foremost of just judges and honoured men , bringing a boy of my name , with a forehead that i know and golden hair , to this placethen fair to look upon , with not a trace of this day's disfigurementand i hear him tell the child my story , with a tender and a faltering voice .
it is a far , far better thing that i do , than i have ever done ; it is a far , far better rest that i go to than i have ever known .
 the ion is the shortest , or nearly the shortest , of all the writings which bear the name of plato , and is not authenticated by any early external testimony .
the grace and beauty of this little work supply the only , and perhaps a sufficient , proof of its genuineness .
the plan is simple ; the dramatic interest consists entirely in the contrast between the irony of socrates and the transparent vanity and childlike enthusiasm of the rhapsode ion .
the theme of the dialogue may possibly have been suggested by the passage of xenophon's memorabilia in which the rhapsodists are described by euthydemus as 'very precise about the exact words of homer , but very idiotic themselves .
'compare aristotle , met .
ion the rhapsode has just come to athens ; he has been exhibiting in epidaurus at the festival of asclepius , and is intending to exhibit at the festival of the panathenaea .
socrates admires and envies the rhapsode's art ; for he is always well dressed and in good companyin the company of good poets and of homer , who is the prince of them .
in the course of conversation the admission is elicited from ion that his skill is restricted to homer , and that he knows nothing of inferior poets , such as hesiod and archilochus ;he brightens up and is wide awake when homer is being recited , but is apt to go to sleep at the recitations of any other poet .
'and yet , surely , he who knows the superior ought to know the inferior also ;he who can judge of the good speaker is able to judge of the bad .
and poetry is a whole ; and he who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of all poetry .
'this is confirmed by the analogy of sculpture , painting , fluteplaying , and the other arts .
the argument is at last brought home to the mind of ion , who asks how this contradiction is to be solved .
the solution given by socrates is as follows : the rhapsode is not guided by rules of art , but is an inspired person who derives a mysterious power from the poet ; and the poet , in like manner , is inspired by the god .
the poets and their interpreters may be compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another , and from a magnet .
the magnet is the muse , and the ring which immediately follows is the poet himself ; from him are suspended other poets ; there is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors , who also hang from the muses , but are let down at the side ; and the last ring of all is the spectator .
the poet is the inspired interpreter of the god , and this is the reason why some poets , like homer , are restricted to a single theme , or , like tynnichus , are famous for a single poem ; and the rhapsode is the inspired interpreter of the poet , and for a similar reason some rhapsodes , like ion , are the interpreters of single poets .
ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired , and acknowledges that he is beside himself when he is performing ;his eyes rain tears and his hair stands on end .
socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends and there is nothing to trouble him .
ion is confident that socrates would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments of homer .
socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything in homer .
'yes , indeed he can .
''what about things of which he has no knowledge ?
'ion answers that he can interpret anything in homer .
but , rejoins socrates , when homer speaks of the arts , as for example , of chariotdriving , or of medicine , or of prophecy , or of navigationwill he , or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the better judge ?
ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of his own particular art better than the rhapsode .
he still maintains , however , that he understands the art of the general as well as any one .
'then why in this city of athens , in which men of merit are always being sought after , is he not at once appointed a general ?
'ion replies that he is a foreigner , and the athenians and spartans will not appoint a foreigner to be their general .
'no , that is not the real reason ; there are many examples to the contrary .
but ion has long been playing tricks with the argument ; like proteus , he transforms himself into a variety of shapes , and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general .
would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest ?
'ion , who has no suspicion of the irony of socrates , eagerly embraces the alternative of inspiration .
the ion , like the other earlier platonic dialogues , is a mixture of jest and earnest , in which no definite result is obtained , but some socratic or platonic truths are allowed dimly to appear .
the elements of a true theory of poetry are contained in the notion that the poet is inspired .
genius is often said to be unconscious , or spontaneous , or a gift of nature : that 'genius is akin to madness' is a popular aphorism of modern times .
the greatest strength is observed to have an element of limitation .
sense or passion are too much for the 'dry light' of intelligence which mingles with them and becomes discoloured by them .
imagination is often at war with reason and fact .
the concentration of the mind on a single object , or on a single aspect of human nature , overpowers the orderly perception of the whole .
yet the feelings too bring truths home to the minds of many who in the way of reason would be incapable of understanding them .
reflections of this kind may have been passing before plato's mind when he describes the poet as inspired , or when , as in the apology , he speaks of poets as the worst critics of their own writingsanybody taken at random from the crowd is a better interpreter of them than they are of themselves .
they are sacred persons , 'winged and holy things' who have a touch of madness in their composition phaedr .
 ,and should be treated with every sort of respect republic , but not allowed to live in a wellordered state .
like the statesmen in the meno , they have a divine instinct , but they are narrow and confused ; they do not attain to the clearness of ideas , or to the knowledge of poetry or of any other art as a whole .
in the protagoras the ancient poets are recognized by protagoras himself as the original sophists ; and this family resemblance may be traced in the ion .
the rhapsode belongs to the realm of imitation and of opinion : he professes to have all knowledge , which is derived by him from homer , just as the sophist professes to have all wisdom , which is contained in his art of rhetoric .
even more than the sophist he is incapable of appreciating the commonest logical distinctions ; he cannot explain the nature of his own art ; his great memory contrasts with his inability to follow the steps of the argument .
and in his highest moments of inspiration he has an eye to his own gains .
the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry , which in the republic leads to their final separation , is already working in the mind of plato , and is embodied by him in the contrast between socrates and ion .
yet here , as in the republic , socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic nature .
also , the manner in which ion is affected by his own recitations affords a lively illustration of the power which , in the republic , socrates attributes to dramatic performances over the mind of the performer .
his allusion to his embellishments of homer , in which he declares himself to have surpassed metrodorus of lampsacus and stesimbrotus of thasos , seems to show that , like them , he belonged to the allegorical school of interpreters .
the circumstance that nothing more is known of him may be adduced in confirmation of the argument that this truly platonic little work is not a forgery of later times .
ion persons of the dialogue : socrates , ion .
socrates : welcome , ion .
are you from your native city of ephesus ?
ion : no , socrates ; but from epidaurus , where i attended the festival of asclepius .
socrates : and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the festival ?
ion : o yes ; and of all sorts of musical performers .
socrates : and were you one of the competitorsand did you succeed ?
ion : i obtained the first prize of all , socrates .
socrates : well done ; and i hope that you will do the same for us at the panathenaea .
ion : and i will , please heaven .
socrates : i often envy the profession of a rhapsode , ion ; for you have always to wear fine clothes , and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of your art .
then , again , you are obliged to be continually in the company of many good poets ; and especially of homer , who is the best and most divine of them ; and to understand him , and not merely learn his words by rote , is a thing greatly to be envied .
and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet .
for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers , but how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means ?
all this is greatly to be envied .
ion : very true , socrates ; interpretation has certainly been the most laborious part of my art ; and i believe myself able to speak about homer better than any man ; and that neither metrodorus of lampsacus , nor stesimbrotus of thasos , nor glaucon , nor any one else who ever was , had as good ideas about homer as i have , or as many .
socrates : i am glad to hear you say so , ion ; i see that you will not refuse to acquaint me with them .
ion : certainly , socrates ; and you really ought to hear how exquisitely i render homer .
i think that the homeridae should give me a golden crown .
socrates : i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of him at some other time .
but just now i should like to ask you a question : does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus , or to homer only ?
ion : to homer only ; he is in himself quite enough .
socrates : are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree ?
ion : yes ; in my opinion there are a good many .
socrates : and can you interpret better what homer says , or what hesiod says , about these matters in which they agree ?
ion : i can interpret them equally well , socrates , where they agree .
socrates : but what about matters in which they do not agree ?
forexample , about divination , of which both homer and hesiod have something to say , ion : very true : socrates : would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what these two poets say about divination , not only when they agree , but when they disagree ?
ion : a prophet .
socrates : and if you were a prophet , would you not be able to interpret them when they disagree as well as when they agree ?
ion : clearly .
socrates : but how did you come to have this skill about homer only , and not about hesiod or the other poets ?
does not homer speak of the same themes which all other poets handle ?
is not war his great argument ?
and does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men , good and bad , skilled and unskilled , and of the gods conversing with one another and with mankind , and about what happens in heaven and in the world below , and the generations of gods and heroes ?
are not these the themes of which homer sings ?
ion : very true , socrates .
socrates : and do not the other poets sing of the same ?
ion : yes , socrates ; but not in the same way as homer .
socrates : what , in a worse way ?
ion : yes , in a far worse .
socrates : and homer in a better way ?
ion : he is incomparably better .
socrates : and yet surely , my dear friend ion , in a discussion about arithmetic , where many people are speaking , and one speaks better than the rest , there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good speaker ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who judges of the bad speakers ?
ion : the same .
socrates : and he will be the arithmetician ?
ion : yes .
socrates : well , and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food , when many persons are speaking , and one speaks better than the rest , will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who recognizes the worse , or the same ?
ion : clearly the same .
socrates : and who is he , and what is his name ?
ion : the physician .
socrates : and speaking generally , in all discussions in which the subject is the same and many men are speaking , will not he who knows the good know the bad speaker also ?
for if he does not know the bad , neither will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed .
ion : true .
socrates : is not the same person skilful in both ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and you say that homer and the other poets , such as hesiod and archilochus , speak of the same things , although not in the same way ; but the one speaks well and the other not so well ?
ion : yes ; and i am right in saying so .
socrates : and if you knew the good speaker , you would also know the inferior speakers to be inferior ?
ion : that is true .
socrates : then , my dear friend , can i be mistaken in saying that ion is equally skilled in homer and in other poets , since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things ; and that almost all poets do speak of the same things ?
ion : why then , socrates , do i lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value , when any one speaks of any other poet ; but when homer is mentioned , i wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say ?
socrates : the reason , my friend , is obvious .
no one can fail to see that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge .
if you were able to speak of him by rules of art , you would have been able to speak of all other poets ; for poetry is a whole .
ion : yes .
socrates : and when any one acquires any other art as a whole , the same may be said of them .
would you like me to explain my meaning , ion ?
ion : yes , indeed , socrates ; i very much wish that you would : for i love to hear you wise men talk .
socrates : o that we were wise , ion , and that you could truly call us so ; but you rhapsodes and actors , and the poets whose verses you sing , are wise ; whereas i am a common man , who only speak the truth .
for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which i have saida thing which any man might say : that when a man has acquired a knowledge of a whole art , the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same .
let us consider this matter ; is not the art of painting a whole ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and there are and have been many painters good and bad ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon , but incapable of criticizing other painters ; and when the work of any other painter was produced , went to sleep and was at a loss , and had no ideas ; but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus , or whoever the painter might be , and about him only , woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say ?
ion : no indeed , i have never known such a person .
socrates : or did you ever know of any one in sculpture , who was skilful in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion , or of epeius the son of panopeus , or of theodorus the samian , or of any individual sculptor ; but when the works of sculptors in general were produced , was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say ?
ion : no indeed ; no more than the other .
socrates : and if i am not mistaken , you never met with any one among fluteplayers or harpplayers or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus , or phemius the rhapsode of ithaca , but was at a loss when he came to speak of ion of ephesus , and had no notion of his merits or defects ?
ion : i cannot deny what you say , socrates .
nevertheless i am conscious in my own self , and the world agrees with me in thinking that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any other man .
but i do not speak equally well about otherstell me the reason of this .
socrates : i perceive , ion ; and i will proceed to explain to you what i imagine to be the reason of this .
the gift which you possess of speaking excellently about homer is not an art , but , as i was just saying , an inspiration ; there is a divinity moving you , like that contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet , but which is commonly known as the stone of heraclea .
this stone not only attracts iron rings , but also imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings ; and sometimes you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a long chain : and all of them derive their power of suspension from the original stone .
in like manner the muse first of all inspires men herself ; and from these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended , who take the inspiration .
for all good poets , epic as well as lyric , compose their beautiful poems not by art , but because they are inspired and possessed .
and as the corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right mind , so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains : but when falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired and possessed ; like bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of dionysus but not when they are in their right mind .
and the soul of the lyric poet does the same , as they themselves say ; for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains , culling them out of the gardens and dells of the muses ; they , like the bees , winging their way from flower to flower .
and this is true .
for the poet is a light and winged and holy thing , and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses , and the mind is no longer in him : when he has not attained to this state , he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles .
many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions of men ; but like yourself when speaking about homer , they do not speak of them by any rules of art : they are simply inspired to utter that to which the muse impels them , and that only ; and when inspired , one of them will make dithyrambs , another hymns of praise , another choral strains , another epic or iambic versesand he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of verse : for not by art does the poet sing , but by power divine .
had he learned by rules of art , he would have known how to speak not of one theme only , but of all ; and therefore god takes away the minds of poets , and uses them as his ministers , as he also uses diviners and holy prophets , in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness , but that god himself is the speaker , and that through them he is conversing with us .
and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking instance of what i am saying : he wrote nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which is in every one's mouth , one of the finest poems ever written , simply an invention of the muses , as he himself says .
for in this way the god would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human , or the work of man , but divine and the work of god ; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are severally possessed .
was not this the lesson which the god intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of songs ?
am i not right , ion ?
ion : yes , indeed , socrates , i feel that you are ; for your words touch my soul , and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us .
socrates : and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets ?
ion : there again you are right .
socrates : then you are the interpreters of interpreters ?
ion : precisely .
socrates : i wish you would frankly tell me , ion , what i am going to ask of you : when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the recitation of some striking passage , such as the apparition of odysseus leaping forth on the floor , recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows at his feet , or the description of achilles rushing at hector , or the sorrows of andromache , hecuba , or priam ,are you in your right mind ?
are you not carried out of yourself , and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are speaking , whether they are in ithaca or in troy or whatever may be the scene of the poem ?
ion : that proof strikes home to me , socrates .
for i must frankly confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears , and when i speak of horrors , my hair stands on end and my heart throbs .
socrates : well , ion , and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice or festival , when he is dressed in holiday attire , and has golden crowns upon his head , of which nobody has robbed him , appears weeping or panicstricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly faces , when there is no one despoiling or wronging him ;is he in his right mind or is he not ?
ion : no indeed , socrates , i must say that , strictly speaking , he is not in his right mind .
socrates : and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most of the spectators ?
ion : only too well ; for i look down upon them from the stage , and behold the various emotions of pity , wonder , sternness , stamped upon their countenances when i am speaking : and i am obliged to give my very best attention to them ; for if i make them cry i myself shall laugh , and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives .
socrates : do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which , as i am saying , receive the power of the original magnet from one another ?
the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links , and the poet himself is the first of them .
through all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases , and makes one man hang down from another .
thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses , who are suspended , as if from the stone , at the side of the rings which hang down from the muse .
and every poet has some muse from whom he is suspended , and by whom he is said to be possessed , which is nearly the same thing ; for he is taken hold of .
and from these first rings , which are the poets , depend others , some deriving their inspiration from orpheus , others from musaeus ; but the greater number are possessed and held by homer .
of whom , ion , you are one , and are possessed by homer ; and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to sleep , and know not what to say ; but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment , and your soul leaps within you , and you have plenty to say ; for not by art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say , but by divine inspiration and by possession ; just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are possessed , and have plenty of dances and words for that , but take no heed of any other .
and you , ion , when the name of homer is mentioned have plenty to say , and have nothing to say of others .
you ask , 'why is this ?
'the answer is that you praise homer not by art but by divine inspiration .
ion : that is good , socrates ; and yet i doubt whether you will ever have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only when i am mad and possessed ; and if you could hear me speak of him i am sure you would never think this to be the case .
socrates : i should like very much to hear you , but not until you have answered a question which i have to ask .
on what part of homer do you speak well ?
notsurely about every part .
ion : there is no part , socrates , about which i do not speak well : of that i can assure you .
socrates : surely not about things in homer of which you have no knowledge ?
ion : and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge ?
socrates : why , does not homer speak in many passages about arts ?
for example , about driving ; if i can only remember the lines i will repeat them .
ion : i remember , and will repeat them .
socrates : tell me then , what nestor says to antilochus , his son , where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of patroclus .
ion : 'bend gently ,' he says , 'in the polished chariot to the left of them , and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice ; and slacken the rein .
and when you are at the goal , let the left horse draw near , yet so that the nave of the wellwrought wheel may not even seem to touch the extremity ; and avoid catching the stone il .
 .
'socrates : enough .
now , ion , will the charioteer or the physician be the better judge of the propriety of these lines ?
ion : the charioteer , clearly .
socrates : and will the reason be that this is his art , or will there be any other reason ?
ion : no , that will be the reason .
socrates : and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a certain work ; for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not know by the art of medicine ?
ion : certainly not .
socrates : nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know by the art of medicine ?
ion : certainly not .
socrates : and this is true of all the arts ;that which we know with one art we do not know with the other ?
but let me ask a prior question : you admit that there are differences of arts ?
ion : yes .
socrates : you would argue , as i should , that when one art is of one kind of knowledge and another of another , they are different ?
ion : yes .
socrates : yes , surely ; for if the subject of knowledge were the same , there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different ,if they both gave the same knowledge .
for example , i know that here are five fingers , and you know the same .
and if i were to ask whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic , you would acknowledge that we did ?
ion : yes .
socrates : tell me , then , what i was intending to ask you ,whether this holds universally ?
must the same art have the same subject of knowledge , and different arts other subjects of knowledge ?
ion : that is my opinion , socrates .
socrates : then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art ?
ion : very true .
socrates : then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were reciting from homer , you or the charioteer ?
ion : the charioteer .
socrates : why , yes , because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer .
ion : yes .
socrates : and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the charioteer ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and if a different knowledge , then a knowledge of different matters ?
ion : true .
socrates : you know the passage in which hecamede , the concubine of nestor , is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset , as he says , 'made with pramnian wine ; and she grated cheese of goat's milk with a grater of bronze , and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish to drink il .
 .
'now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines ?
ion : the art of medicine .
socrates : and when homer says , 'and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet , which , set in the horn of ox that ranges in the fields , rushes along carrying death among the ravenous fishes il .
 ,'will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not ?
ion : clearly , socrates , the art of the fisherman .
socrates : come now , suppose that you were to say to me : 'since you , socrates , are able to assign different passages in homer to their corresponding arts , i wish that you would tell me what are the passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic art' ; and you will see how readily and truly i shall answer you .
for there are many such passages , particularly in the odyssee ; as , for example , the passage in which theoclymenus the prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors : 'wretched men !
what is happening to you ?
your heads and your faces and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night ; and the voice of lamentation bursts forth , and your cheeks are wet with tears .
and the vestibule is full , and the court is full , of ghosts descending into the darkness of erebus , and the sun has perished out of heaven , and an evil mist is spread abroad od .
 .
'and there are many such passages in the iliad also ; as for example in the description of the battle near the rampart , where he says : 'as they were eager to pass the ditch , there came to them an omen : a soaring eagle , holding back the people on the left , bore a huge bloody dragon in his talons , still living and panting ; nor had he yet resigned the strife , for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the breast by the neck , and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude .
and the eagle , with a cry , was borne afar on the wings of the wind il .
 .
'these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet ought to consider and determine .
ion : and you are quite right , socrates , in saying so .
socrates : yes , ion , and you are right also .
and as i have selected from the iliad and odyssee for you passages which describe the office of the prophet and the physician and the fisherman , do you , who know homer so much better than i do , ion , select for me passages which relate to the rhapsode and the rhapsode's art , and which the rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men .
ion : all passages , i should say , socrates .
socrates : not all , ion , surely .
have you already forgotten what you were saying ?
a rhapsode ought to have a better memory .
ion : why , what am i forgetting ?
socrates : do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode to be different from the art of the charioteer ?
ion : yes , i remember .
socrates : and you admitted that being different they would have different subjects of knowledge ?
ion : yes .
socrates : then upon your own showing the rhapsode , and the art of the rhapsode , will not know everything ?
ion : i should exclude certain things , socrates .
socrates : you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the subjects of the other arts .
as he does not know all of them , which of them will he know ?
ion : he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say , and what a freeman and what a slave ought to say , and what a ruler and what a subject .
socrates : do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot what the ruler of a seatossed vessel ought to say ?
ion : no ; the pilot will know best .
socrates : or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the ruler of a sick man ought to say ?
ion : he will not .
socrates : but he will know what a slave ought to say ?
ion : yes .
socrates : suppose the slave to be a cowherd ; the rhapsode will know better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the infuriated cows ?
ion : no , he will not .
socrates : but he will know what a spinningwoman ought to say about the working of wool ?
ion : no .
socrates : at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when exhorting his soldiers ?
ion : yes , that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to know .
socrates : well , but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general ?
ion : i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say .
socrates : why , yes , ion , because you may possibly have a knowledge of the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode ; and you may also have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre : and then you would know when horses were well or ill managed .
but suppose i were to ask you : by the help of which art , ion , do you know whether horses are well managed , by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyrewhat would you answer ?
ion : i should reply , by my skill as a horseman .
socrates : and if you judged of performers on the lyre , you would admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre , and not as a horseman ?
ion : yes .
socrates : and in judging of the general's art , do you judge of it as a general or a rhapsode ?
ion : to me there appears to be no difference between them .
socrates : what do you mean ?
do you mean to say that the art of the rhapsode and of the general is the same ?
ion : yes , one and the same .
socrates : then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general ?
ion : certainly , socrates .
socrates : and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode ?
ion : no ; i do not say that .
socrates : but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general .
ion : certainly .
socrates : and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes ?
ion : far the best , socrates .
socrates : and are you the best general , ion ?
ion : to be sure , socrates ; and homer was my master .
socrates : but then , ion , what in the name of goodness can be the reason why you , who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes in all hellas , go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general ?
do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown , and do not want a general ?
ion : why , socrates , the reason is , that my countrymen , the ephesians , are the servants and soldiers of athens , and do not need a general ; and you and sparta are not likely to have me , for you think that you have enough generals of your own .
socrates : my good ion , did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus ?
ion : who may he be ?
socrates : one who , though a foreigner , has often been chosen their general by the athenians : and there is phanosthenes of andros , and heraclides of clazomenae , whom they have also appointed to the command of their armies and to other offices , although aliens , after they had shown their merit .
and will they not choose ion the ephesian to be their general , and honour him , if he prove himself worthy ?
were not the ephesians originally athenians , and ephesus is no mean city ?
but , indeed , ion , if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise homer , you do not deal fairly with me , and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things about homer , and promises that you would exhibit them , you are only a deceiver , and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master , will not , even after my repeated entreaties , explain to me the nature of it .
you have literally as many forms as proteus ; and now you go all manner of ways , twisting and turning , and , like proteus , become all manner of people at once , and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general , in order that you may escape exhibiting your homeric lore .
and if you have art , then , as i was saying , in falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer , you are not dealing fairly with me .
but if , as i believe , you have no art , but speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence , then i acquit you of dishonesty , and shall only say that you are inspired .
which do you prefer to be thought , dishonest or inspired ?
ion : there is a great difference , socrates , between the two alternatives ; and inspiration is by far the nobler .
socrates : then , ion , i shall assume the nobler alternative ; and attribute to you in your praises of homer inspiration , and not art .
bud1    edsdb    it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
my dear mr. bennet , said his lady to him one day , have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ?
mr. bennet replied that he had not .
but it is , returned she ; for mrs. long has just been here , and she told me all about it .
mr. bennet made no answer .
do you not want to know who has taken it ?
cried his wife impatiently .
you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it .
this was invitation enough .
why , my dear , you must know , mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with mr. morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .
what is his name ?
bingley .
is he married or single ?
oh !
single , my dear , to be sure !
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .
what a fine thing for our girls !
how so ?
how can it affect them ?
my dear mr. bennet , replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them .
is that his design in settling here ?
design !
nonsense , how can you talk so !
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .
i see no occasion for that .
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr. bingley may like you the best of the party .
my dear , you flatter me .
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now .
when a woman has five grownup daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .
in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .
but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .
it is more than i engage for , i assure you .
but consider your daughters .
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers .
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not .
you are overscrupulous , surely .
i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy .
i desire you will do no such thing .
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so goodhumoured as lydia .
but you are always giving her the preference .
they have none of them much to recommend them , replied he ; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .
mr .
bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?
you take delight in vexing me .
you have no compassion for my poor nerves .
you mistake me , my dear .
i have a high respect for your nerves .
they are my old friends .
i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least .
ah , you do not know what i suffer .
but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .
it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them .
depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all .
mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .
her mind was less difficult to develop .
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .
when she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous .
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley .
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it .
it was then disclosed in the following manner .
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with : i hope mr. bingley will like it , lizzy .
we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes , said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .
but you forget , mamma , said elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs. long promised to introduce him .
i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing .
she has two nieces of her own .
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her .
no more have i , said mr. bennet ; and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply , but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .
dont keep coughing so , kitty , for heavens sake !
have a little compassion on my nerves .
you tear them to pieces .
kitty has no discretion in her coughs , said her father ; she times them ill .
i do not cough for my own amusement , replied kitty fretfully .
when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?
tomorrow fortnight .
aye , so it is , cried her mother , and mrs. long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .
then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr. bingley to her .
impossible , mr. bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ?
i honour your circumspection .
a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little .
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .
but if we do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself .
the girls stared at their father .
mrs. bennet said only , nonsense , nonsense !
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?
cried he .
do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?
i cannot quite agree with you there .
what say you , mary ?
for you are a young lady of deep reflection , i know , and read great books and make extracts .
mary wished to say something sensible , but knew not how .
while mary is adjusting her ideas , he continued , let us return to mr. bingley .
i am sick of mr. bingley , cried his wife .
i am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me that before ?
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him .
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .
how good it was in you , my dear mr. bennet !
but i knew i should persuade you at last .
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .
well , how pleased i am !
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now .
now , kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , said mr. bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .
what an excellent father you have , girls !
said she , when the door was shut .
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter .
at our time of life it is not so pleasant , i can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything .
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball .
oh !
said lydia stoutly , i am not afraid ; for though i am the youngest , im the tallest .
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennets visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
not all that mrs. bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject , was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley .
they attacked him in various wayswith barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all , and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour , lady lucas .
her report was highly favourable .
sir william had been delighted with him .
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .
nothing could be more delightful !
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr. bingleys heart were entertained .
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , said mrs. bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for .
in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennets visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat , and rode a black horse .
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .
mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and , consequently , unable to accept the honour of their invitation , etc .
mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted .
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies , but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin .
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogethermr .
bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .
mr. bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .
his brotherinlaw , mr. hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien , and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud ; to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .
what a contrast between him and his friend !
mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .
his character was decided .
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again .
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr. bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .
come , darcy , said he , i must have you dance .
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .
you had much better dance .
i certainly shall not .
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable .
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .
i would not be so fastidious as you are , cried mr. bingley , for a kingdom !
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , said mr. darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet .
oh !
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say very agreeable .
do let me ask my partner to introduce you .
which do you mean ?
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said : she is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt me ; i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .
mr. bingley followed his advice .
mr. darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him .
she told the story , however , with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in anything ridiculous .
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .
mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .
mr. bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .
elizabeth felt janes pleasure .
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .
they returned , therefore , in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .
they found mr. bennet still up .
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .
he had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear .
oh , my dear mr. bennet , as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .
i wish you had been there .
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .
everybody said how well she looked ; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice !
only think of that , my dear ; he actually danced with her twice !
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .
first of all , he asked miss lucas .
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her !
but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .
so he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .
then the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !
for gods sake , say no more of his partners .
oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance !
oh !
my dear , i am quite delighted with him .
he is so excessively handsome !
and his sisters are charming women .
i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses .
i dare say the lace upon mrs. hursts gown here she was interrupted again .
mr. bennet protested against any description of finery .
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .
but i can assure you , she added , that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !
not handsome enough to dance with !
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your setdowns .
i quite detest the man .
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before , expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him .
he is just what a young man ought to be , said she , sensible , goodhumoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !
somuch ease , with such perfect good breeding !
he is also handsome , replied elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .
his character is thereby complete .
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .
i did not expect such a compliment .
did not you ?
i did for you .
but that is one great difference between us .
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .
no thanks to his gallantry for that .
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .
you have liked many a stupider person .
dear lizzy !
oh !
you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general .
you never see a fault in anybody .
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life .
i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but i always speak what i think .
i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !
affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere .
but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better , and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone .
and so you like this mans sisters , too , do you ?
their manners are not equal to his .
certainly notat first .
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .
miss bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited .
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .
mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .
his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .
mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .
he did look at it , and into it for halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of great opposition of character .
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .
on the strength of darcys regard , bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgement the highest opinion .
in understanding , darcy was the superior .
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though wellbred , were not inviting .
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offense .
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life ; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ; there had been no formality , no stiffness ; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and , as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they would not object to know more of .
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose .
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty .
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
it had given him a disgust to his business , and to his residence in a small market town ; and , in quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
for , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody .
by nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at st .
jamess had made him courteous .
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .
they had several children .
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twentyseven , was elizabeths intimate friend .
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .
you began the evening well , charlotte , said mrs. bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas .
you were mr. bingleys first choice .
yes ; but he seemed to like his second better .
oh !
you mean jane , i suppose , because he danced with her twice .
to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr. robinson .
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?
mr. robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?
and his answering immediately to the last question : oh !
the eldest miss bennet , beyond a doubt ; there cannot be two opinions on that point .
upon my word !
well , that is very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut , however , it may all come to nothing , you know .
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , said charlotte .
mr .
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?
pooreliza !
tobe only just tolerable .
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment , for he is such a disagreeable man , that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips .
are you quite sure , maam ?
isnot there a little mistake ?
said jane .
i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her .
ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to .
miss bingley told me , said jane , that he never speaks much , unless among his intimate acquaintances .
with them he is remarkably agreeable .
i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
if he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to mrs. long .
but i can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .
i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long , said miss lucas , but i wish he had danced with eliza .
another time , lizzy , said her mother , i would not dance with him , if i were you .
i believe , maam , i may safely promise you never to dance with him .
his pride , said miss lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself .
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud .
that is very true , replied elizabeth , and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .
pride , observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing , i believe .
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously .
a person may be proud without being vain .
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .
if i were as rich as mr. darcy , cried a young lucas , who came with his sisters , i should not care how proud i was .
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day .
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said mrs. bennet ; and if i were to see you at it , i should take away your bottle directly .
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .
the visit was soon returned in due form .
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest .
by jane , this attention was received with the greatest pleasure , but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration .
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united , with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
it may perhaps be pleasant , replied charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels .
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .
but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton , indeed , not to discover it too .
remember , eliza , that he does not know janes disposition as you do .
but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .
perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
but , though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and , as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention .
when she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses .
your plan is a good one , replied elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married , and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .
but these are not janes feelings ; she is not acting by design .
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness .
she has known him only a fortnight .
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined with him in company four times .
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character .
not as you represent it .
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal .
yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded .
well , said charlotte , i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him tomorrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .
you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .
occupied in observing mr. bingleys attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .
of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
his doing so drew her notice .
it was at sir william lucass , where a large party were assembled .
what does mr. darcy mean , said she to charlotte , by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ?
that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer .
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him .
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him ; which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said : did you not think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?
with great energy ; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic .
you are severe on us .
it will be her turn soon to be teased , said miss lucas .
i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows .
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !
alwayswanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody !
if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .
on miss lucass persevering , however , she added , very well , if it must be so , it must .
and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , there is a fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with : keep your breath to cool your porridge ; and i shall keep mine to swell my song .
her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who , with some of the lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began : what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !
there is nothing like dancing after all .
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society .
certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .
every savage can dance .
sir william only smiled .
your friend performs delightfully , he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr. darcy .
you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir .
yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .
do you often dance at st .
jamess ?
never , sir .
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it .
you have a house in town , i conclude ?
mr. darcy bowed .
i had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas .
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her : my dear miss eliza , why are you not dancing ?
mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .
you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure when so much beauty is before you .
and , taking her hand , he would have given it to mr. darcy who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william : indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner .
mr. darcy , with grave propriety , requested to be allowed the honour of her hand , but in vain .
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .
you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one halfhour .
mr .
darcy is all politeness , said elizabeth , smiling .
he is , indeed ; but , considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a partner ?
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley : i can guess the subject of your reverie .
i should imagine not .
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion .
i was never more annoyed !
the insipidity , and yet the noisethe nothingness , and yet the selfimportance of all those people !
what would i give to hear your strictures on them !
your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .
my mind was more agreeably engaged .
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .
mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity : miss elizabeth bennet .
miss elizabeth bennet !
repeated miss bingley .
i am all astonishment .
how long has she been such a favourite ?
andpray , when am i to wish you joy ?
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .
a ladys imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment .
i knew you would be wishing me joy .
nay , if you are serious about it , i shall consider the matter is absolutely settled .
you will be having a charming motherinlaw , indeed ; and , of course , she will always be at pemberley with you .
he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .
mr. bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mothers fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .
she had a sister married to a mr. phillips , who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way .
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the headquarters .
their visits to mrs. phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections .
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .
mr. phillips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before .
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr. bingleys large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr. bennet coolly observed : from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced .
catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .
i am astonished , my dear , said mrs. bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children , it should not be of my own , however .
if my children are silly , i must hope to be always sensible of it .
yesbut as it happens , they are all of them very clever .
this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree .
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .
my dear mr. bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .
when they get to our age , i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland , indeed , so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals .
mamma , cried lydia , my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library .
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .
mrs. bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , well , jane , who is it from ?
what is it about ?
what does he say ?
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love .
it is from miss bingley , said jane , and then read it aloud .
my dear friend , if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole days ttette between two women can never end without a quarrel .
come as soon as you can on receipt of this .
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .
yoursever , caroline bingley with the officers !
cried lydia .
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .
dining out , said mrs. bennet , that is very unlucky .
can i have the carriage ?
said jane .
no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night .
that would be a good scheme , said elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .
oh !
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingleys chaise to go to meryton , and the hursts have no horses to theirs .
i had much rather go in the coach .
but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure .
they are wanted in the farm , mr. bennet , are they not ?
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them .
but if you have got them today , said elizabeth , my mothers purpose will be answered .
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .
this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !
said mrs. bennet more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : my dearest lizzy , i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .
my kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am better .
they insist also on my seeing mr. jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand , excepting a sore throat and headache , there is not much the matter with me .
yours ,etc .
well , my dear , said mr. bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley , and under your orders .
oh !
i am not afraid of her dying .
people do not die of little trifling colds .
she will be taken good care of .
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage .
elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative .
she declared her resolution .
how can you be so silly , cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there .
i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want .
is this a hint to me , lizzy , said her father , to send for the horses ?
no , indeed , i do not wish to avoid the walk .
the distance is nothing when one has a motive ; only three miles .
i shall be back by dinner .
i admire the activity of your benevolence , observed mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .
we will go as far as meryton with you , said catherine and lydia .
elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .
if we make haste , said lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes .
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ankles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .
she was shown into the breakfastparlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .
mr. darcy said very little , and mr. hurst nothing at all .
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone .
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room .
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .
elizabeth silently attended her .
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane .
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment ; nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had , in fact , nothing to do elsewhere .
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go , and very unwillingly said so .
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes .
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress , and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .
to the civil inquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingleys , she could not make a very favourable answer .
jane was by no means better .
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike .
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .
she had very little notice from any but him .
miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards ; who , when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no beauty .
mrs. hurst thought the same , and added : she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .
she really looked almost wild .
she did , indeed , louisa .
i could hardly keep my countenance .
very nonsensical to come at all !
why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?
her hair , so untidy , so blowsy !
yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office .
your picture may be very exact , louisa , said bingley ; but this was all lost upon me .
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning .
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .
you observed it , mr. darcy , i am sure , said miss bingley ; and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .
certainly not .
to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ankles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !
what could she mean by it ?
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most countrytown indifference to decorum .
it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said bingley .
i am afraid , mr. darcy , observed miss bingley in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .
not at all , he replied ; they were brightened by the exercise .
a short pause followed this speech , and mrs. hurst began again : i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it .
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton .
yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside .
that is capital , added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , cried bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied darcy .
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations .
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep , and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself .
on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below , with a book .
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment .
do you prefer reading to cards ?
said he ; that is rather singular .
miss eliza bennet , said miss bingley , despises cards .
she is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else .
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried elizabeth ; i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things .
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , said bingley ; and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well .
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying .
he immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library afforded .
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever looked into .
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .
i am astonished , said miss bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr. darcy !
it ought to be good , he replied , it has been the work of many generations .
and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .
neglect !
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley .
i wish it may .
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire .
with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it .
i am talking of possibilities , charles .
upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation .
elizabeth was so much caught with what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the cardtable , and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .
is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?
said miss bingley ; will she be as tall as i am ?
i think she will .
she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height , or rather taller .
how i long to see her again !
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .
such a countenance , such manners !
and so extremely accomplished for her age !
her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite .
it is amazing to me , said bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are .
all young ladies accomplished !
my dear charles , what do you mean ?
yes , all of them , i think .
they all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses .
i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .
your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said darcy , has too much truth .
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen .
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .
i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .
nor i , i am sure , said miss bingley .
then , observed elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .
yes , i do comprehend a great deal in it .
oh !
certainly , cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but halfdeserved .
all this she must possess , added darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .
i rather wonder now at your knowing any .
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ?
i never saw such a woman .
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe united .
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr. hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .
elizabeth bennet , said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .
undoubtedly , replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .
bingley urged mr. jones being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .
this she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal ; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better .
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgement of her situation .
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .
mrs. bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs. bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .
she would not listen , therefore , to her daughters proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingleys appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .
indeed i have , sir , was her answer .
she is a great deal too ill to be moved .
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her .
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness .
removed !
cried bingley .
it must not be thought of .
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal .
you may depend upon it , madam , said miss bingley , with cold civility , that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us .
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .
i am sure , she added , if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i have ever met with .
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .
you have a sweet room here , mr. bingley , and a charming prospect over the gravel walk .
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry , i hope , though you have but a short lease .
whatever i do is done in a hurry , replied he ; and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here .
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , said elizabeth .
you begin to comprehend me , do you ?
cried he , turning towards her .
oh !
yesi understand you perfectly .
i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful .
that is as it happens .
it does not follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .
lizzy , cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .
i did not know before , continued bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .
it must be an amusing study .
yes , but intricate characters are the most amusing .
they have at least that advantage .
the country , said darcy , can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study .
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .
but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .
yes , indeed , cried mrs. bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .
everybody was surprised , and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .
mrs. bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places .
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is it not , mr. bingley ?
when i am in the country , he replied , i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either .
ayethat is because you have the right disposition .
but that gentleman , looking at darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .
indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
you quite mistook mr. darcy .
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town , which you must acknowledge to be true .
certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
i know we dine with fourandtwenty families .
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eyes towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile .
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away .
yes , she called yesterday with her father .
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr. bingley , is not he ?
so much the man of fashion !
so genteel and easy !
he has always something to say to everybody .
that is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important , and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .
did charlotte dine with you ?
no , she would go home .
i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies .
for my part , mr. bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up very differently .
but everybody is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are a very good sort of girls , i assure you .
it is a pity they are not handsome !
not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend .
she seems a very pleasant young woman .
oh !
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain .
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me janes beauty .
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , janeone does not often see anybody better looking .
it is what everybody says .
i do not trust my own partiality .
when she was only fifteen , there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .
but , however , he did not .
perhaps he thought her too young .
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .
and so ended his affection , said elizabeth impatiently .
there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way .
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said darcy .
of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .
everything nourishes what is strong already .
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .
darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .
mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs. bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .
lydia was a stout , wellgrown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural selfconsequence , which the attention of the officers , to whom her uncles good dinners , and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .
she was very equal , therefore , to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear : i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball .
but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill .
lydia declared herself satisfied .
oh !
yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .
and when you have given your ball , she added , i shall insist on their giving one also .
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes .
the day passed much as the day before had done .
mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom .
the lootable , however , did not appear .
mr. darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .
mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet , and mrs. hurst was observing their game .
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .
the perpetual commendations of the lady , either on his handwriting , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in union with her opinion of each .
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter !
he made no answer .
you write uncommonly fast .
you are mistaken .
i write rather slowly .
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year !
letters of business , too !
how odious i should think them !
it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours .
pray tell your sister that i long to see her .
i have already told her so once , by your desire .
i am afraid you do not like your pen .
let me mend it for you .
i mend pens remarkably well .
thank youbut i always mend my own .
how can you contrive to write so even ?
he was silent .
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp ; and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys .
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?
at present i have not room to do them justice .
oh !
it is of no consequence .
i shall see her in january .
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr. darcy ?
they are generally long ; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine .
it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease , cannot write ill .
that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , cried her brother , because he does not write with ease .
he studies too much for words of four syllables .
do not you , darcy ?
my style of writing is very different from yours .
oh !
cried miss bingley , charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .
your humility , mr. bingley , said elizabeth , must disarm reproof .
nothing is more deceitful , said darcy , than the appearance of humility .
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?
the indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .
the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ?
nay , cried bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .
and yet , upon my honour , i believe what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies .
i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , bingley , you had better stay till next week , you would probably do it , you would probably not goand at another word , might stay a month .
you have only proved by this , cried elizabeth , that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself .
i am exceedingly gratified , said bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could .
would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?
upon my word , i cannot exactly explain the matter ; darcy must speak for himself .
you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged .
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .
to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .
you appear to me , mr. darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley .
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?
will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?
by all means , cried bingley ; let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .
i assure you , that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening , when he has nothing to do .
mr. darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended , and therefore checked her laugh .
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .
i see your design , bingley , said his friend .
you dislike an argument , and want to silence this .
perhaps i do .
arguments are too much like disputes .
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me .
what you ask , said elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter .
mr. darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music .
miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte ; and , after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .
mrs. hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed , elizabeth could not help observing , as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr. darcys eyes were fixed on her .
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .
she could only imagine , however , at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .
the supposition did not pain her .
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr. darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her : do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?
she smiled , but made no answer .
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .
oh !
said she , i heard you before , but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .
you wanted me , i know , to say yes , that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .
i have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare .
indeed i do not dare .
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
i hope , said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your motherinlaw a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after officers .
and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .
have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ?
oh !
yes .
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .
put them next to your greatuncle the judge .
they are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines .
as for your elizabeths picture , you must not have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?
it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .
i did not know that you intended to walk , said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
you used us abominably ill , answered mrs. hurst , running away without telling us that you were coming out .
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .
the path just admitted three .
mr. darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said : this walk is not wide enough for our party .
we had better go into the avenue .
but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered : no , no ; stay where you are .
you are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage .
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
goodbye .
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawingroom , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
their powers of conversation were considerable .
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object ; miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
he addressed himself to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad ; but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation .
he was full of joy and attention .
the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be further from the door .
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else .
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .
when tea was over , mr. hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain .
she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her .
mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep .
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs. hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet .
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcys progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book !
when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library .
no one made any reply .
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said : by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?
i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .
if you mean darcy , cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it beginsbut as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough , i shall send round my cards .
i should like balls infinitely better , she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day .
much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .
miss bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room .
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .
in the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more , and , turning to elizabeth , said : miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .
elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr. darcy looked up .
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .
what could he mean ?
she was dying to know what could be his meaning ?
andasked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?
not at all , was her answer ; but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it .
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i would be completely in your way , and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire .
oh !
shocking !
cried miss bingley .
i never heard anything so abominable .
how shall we punish him for such a speech ?
nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said elizabeth .
we can all plague and punish one another .
tease himlaugh at him .
intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .
but upon my honour , i do not .
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .
tease calmness of manner and presence of mind !
no , no ; i feel he may defy us there .
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .
mr. darcy may hug himself .
mr .
darcy is not to be laughed at !
cried elizabeth .
that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances .
i dearly love a laugh .
miss bingley , said he , has given me more credit than can be .
the wisest and the best of mennay , the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .
certainly , replied elizabeththere are such people , but i hope i am not one of them .
i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good .
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can .
but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without .
perhaps that is not possible for anyone .
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .
such as vanity and pride .
yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .
but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .
your examination of mr. darcy is over , i presume , said miss bingley ; and pray what is the result ?
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect .
he owns it himself without disguise .
no , said darcy , i have made no such pretension .
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding .
my temper i dare not vouch for .
it is , i believe , too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world .
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offenses against myself .
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .
my good opinion once lost , is lost forever .
that is a failing indeed !
cried elizabeth .
implacable resentment is a shade in a character .
but you have chosen your fault well .
i really cannot laugh at it .
you are safe from me .
there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evila natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .
and your defect is to hate everybody .
and yours , he replied with a smile , is willfully to misunderstand them .
do let us have a little music , cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
louisa , you will not mind my waking mr. hurst ?
her sister had not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .
but mrs. bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish janes week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeths wishes , for she was impatient to get home .
mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr. bingleys carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow their going was deferred .
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .
she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her , and more teasing than usual to himself .
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits .
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .
mrs. bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth .
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature ; and had some extracts to admire , and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to .
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .
i hope , my dear , said mr. bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner today , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party .
who do you mean , my dear ?
i know of nobody that is coming , i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for her .
i do not believe she often sees such at home .
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman , and a stranger .
mrs. bennets eyes sparkled .
a gentleman and a stranger !
it is mr. bingley , i am sure !
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley .
butgood lord !
how unlucky !
there is not a bit of fish to be got today .
lydia , my love , ring the belli must speak to hill this moment .
it is not mr. bingley , said her husband ; it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life .
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once .
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained : about a month ago i received this letter ; and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .
it is from my cousin , mr. collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .
oh !
my dear , cried his wife , i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .
pray do not talk of that odious man .
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure , if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .
jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail .
they had often attempted to do it before , but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason , and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said mr. bennet , and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .
no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .
i hate such false friends .
why could he not keep on quarreling with you , as his father did before him ?
why , indeed ; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .
hunsford , near westerham , kent , 15th october .
dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .
there ,mrs. bennet .
mymind , however , is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch .
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafter .
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four oclock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .
iremain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your wellwisher and friend , william collins at four oclock , therefore , we may expect this peacemaking gentleman , said mr. bennet , as he folded up the letter .
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word , and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .
there is some sense in what he says about the girls , however , and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him .
though it is difficult , said jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .
elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
he must be an oddity , i think , said she .
i cannot make him out .
thereis something very pompous in his style .
andwhat can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail ?
wecannot suppose he would help it if he could .
couldhe be a sensible man , sir ?
no , my dear , i think not .
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .
there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter , which promises well .
i am impatient to see him .
in point of composition , said mary , the letter does not seem defective .
the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed .
to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .
as for their mother , mr. collinss letter had done away much of her illwill , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
mr. collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .
mr. bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .
he was a tall , heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty .
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters ; said he had heard much of their beauty , but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage .
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but mrs. bennet , who quarreled with no compliments , answered most readily .
you are very kind , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough .
things are settled so oddly .
you allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate .
ah !
sir , i do indeed .
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .
not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things i know are all chance in this world .
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .
i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .
at present i will not say more ; but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .
they were not the only objects of mr. collinss admiration .
the hall , the diningroom , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennets heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing .
but he was set right there by mrs. bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
he begged pardon for having displeased her .
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .
during dinner , mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .
mr. bennet could not have chosen better .
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise .
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen anything but affability in her .
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs .
that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , said mrs. bennet , and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .
does she live near you , sir ?
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyships residence .
i think you said she was a widow , sir ?
has she any family ?
she has only one daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property .
ah !
said mrs. bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .
and what sort of young lady is she ?
is she handsome ?
she is a most charming young lady indeed .
lady catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex , because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth .
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of , as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .
has she been presented ?
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court .
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .
you judge very properly , said mr. bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .
mr. bennets expectations were fully answered .
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .
by teatime , however , the dose had been enough , and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again , and , when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .
mr. collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but , on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library , he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .
kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .
other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons .
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with : do you know , mamma , that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard ; and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town .
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr. collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said : i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .
it amazes me , i confess ; for , certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .
but i will no longer importune my young cousin .
then turning to mr. bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .
mr. bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr. collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr. bennet , and prepared for backgammon .
mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his right as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , selfimportance and humility .
having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .
his plan did not vary on seeing them .
miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hours ttette with mrs. bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .
as to her younger daughters , she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire .
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces .
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr. collins was to attend them , at the request of mr. bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast ; and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr. bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .
such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly .
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr. collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely pleased to close his large book , and go .
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton .
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them .
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentlemanlike appearance , walking with another officer on the other side of the way .
the officer was the very mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .
all were struck with the strangers air , all wondered who he could be ; and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen , turning back , had reached the same spot .
mr. denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr. wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .
mr. wickham , after a few moments , touched his hata salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return .
what could be the meaning of it ?
it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .
in another minute , mr. bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. phillips house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in , and even in spite of mrs. phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation .
mrs. phillips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr. joness shopboy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by janes introduction of him .
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .
mrs. phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other ; of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire .
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr. wickham appeared , kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers , who , in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .
some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .
this was agreed to , and mrs. phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .
mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be in the wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. phillipss manners and politeness .
he protested that , except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .
something , he supposed , might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt , and all mr. collinss scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawingroom , that mr. wickham had accepted their uncles invitation , and was then in the house .
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. phillips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms , and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room .
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. phillips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .
it was over at last , however .
the gentlemen did approach , and when mr. wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentlemanlike set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broadfaced , stuffy uncle phillips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. phillips , and was by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .
when the cardtables were placed , he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn , by sitting down to whist .
i know little of the game at present , said he , but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation in life mrs. phillips was very glad for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .
mr. wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular .
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy .
she dared not even mention that gentleman .
her curiosity , however , was unexpectedly relieved .
mr. wickham began the subject himself .
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there .
about a month , said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand .
yes , replied mr. wickham ; his estate there is a noble one .
a clear ten thousand per annum .
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself , for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .
elizabeth could not but look surprised .
you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .
are you much acquainted with mr. darcy ?
as much as i ever wish to be , cried elizabeth very warmly .
i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable .
i have no right to give my opinion , said wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .
i am not qualified to form one .
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .
it is impossible for me to be impartial .
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .
here you are in your own family .
upon my word , i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .
everybody is disgusted with his pride .
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone .
i cannot pretend to be sorry , said wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him i believe it does not often happen .
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen .
i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an illtempered man .
wickham only shook his head .
i wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .
i do not at all know ; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .
oh !
noit is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy .
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world , a sense of very great illusage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .
his father , miss bennet , the late mr. darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry .
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .
it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the shire .
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them .
society , i own , is necessary to me .
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .
i must have employment and society .
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .
the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .
indeed !
yesthe late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .
i cannot do justice to his kindness .
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .
good heavens !
cried elizabeth ; but how could that be ?
how could his will be disregarded ?
why did you not seek legal redress ?
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr. darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudencein short anything or nothing .
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may have spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .
i can recall nothing worse .
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .
this is quite shocking !
he deserves to be publicly disgraced .
some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me .
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him .
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
but what , said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?
a thorough , determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .
had the late mr. darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him , i believe , very early in life .
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me .
i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him .
i had not thought so very ill of him .
i had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this .
after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .
his disposition must be dreadful .
i will not trust myself on the subject , replied wickham ; i can hardly be just to him .
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , to treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father !
she could have added , a young man , too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with , and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner !
we were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr. phillips , appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence , and when , immediately before my fathers death , mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of his affection to myself .
how strange !
cried elizabeth .
how abominable !
i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you !
if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it .
it is wonderful , replied wickham , for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride had often been his best friend .
it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling .
but we are none of us consistent , and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride .
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ?
yes .
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
family pride , and filial pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave done this .
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .
he has also brotherly pride , which , with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister , and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .
what sort of girl is miss darcy ?
he shook his head .
i wish i could call her amiable .
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .
but she is too much like her brothervery , very proud .
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .
but she is nothing to me now .
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , i understand , highly accomplished .
since her fathers death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying : i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley !
how can mr. bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?
how can they suit each other ?
do you know mr. bingley ?
not at all .
he is a sweettempered , amiable , charming man .
he cannot know what mr. darcy is .
probably not ; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses .
he does not want abilities .
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberalminded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure .
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. phillips .
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs. phillips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged that she would not make herself uneasy .
i know very well , madam , said he , that when persons sit down to a cardtable , they must take their chances of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .
mr. wickhams attention was caught ; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .
lady catherine de bourgh , she replied , has very lately given him a living .
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy .
no , indeed , i did not .
i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections .
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .
her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already selfdestined for another .
mr .
collins , said she , speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .
i believe her to be both in a great degree , replied wickham ; i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride for her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together , with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards , and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickhams attentions .
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. phillipss supper party , but his manners recommended him to everybody .
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ; and mr. collins in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. phillips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingleys regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .
the possibility of his having endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing remained therefore to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained .
they have both , said she , been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .
very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .
laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner , one whom his father had promised to provide for .
it is impossible .
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?
oh !
no .
i can much more easily believe mr. bingleys being imposed on , than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony .
if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it .
besides , there was truth in his looks .
it is difficult indeedit is distressing .
one does not know what to think .
i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think .
but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennets civilities .
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcys look and behaviour .
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball .
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
while i can have my mornings to myself , said she , it is enoughi think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody .
elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingleys invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .
i am by no means of the opinion , i assure you , said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
she had fully proposed being engaged by mr. wickham for those very dances ; and to have mr. collins instead !
her liveliness had never been worse timed .
there was no help for it , however .
mr. wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer , and mr. collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more .
it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her .
elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy .
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday , and monday endurable to kitty and lydia .
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield , and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here .
this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and , as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
attendance , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .
the first two dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
the moment of her release from him was ecstasy .
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .
when those dances were over , she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her : i dare say you will find him very agreeable .
heaven forbid !
that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
do not wish me such an evil .
when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence .
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours looks , their equal amazement in beholding it .
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .
he replied , and was again silent .
after a pause of some minutes , she addressed him a second time with :it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .
i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .
he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
very well .
that reply will do for the present .
perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
but now we may be silent .
do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ?
sometimes .
one must speak a little , you know .
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?
both , replied elizabeth archly ; for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb .
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , said he .
how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say .
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .
i must not decide on my own performance .
he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .
the effect was immediate .
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , mr .
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
at that moment , sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy , he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
such very superior dancing is not often seen .
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place .
what congratulations will then flow in !
i appeal to mr. darcy :but let me not interrupt you , sir .
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .
i do not think we were speaking at all .
sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine .
what think you of books ?
said he , smiling .
booksoh !
no .
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .
i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .
we may compare our different opinions .
noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom ; my head is always full of something else .
the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it ?
said he , with a look of doubt .
yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created ?
i am , said he , with a firm voice .
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?
i hope not .
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .
may i ask to what these questions tend ?
merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
i am trying to make it out .
and what is your success ?
she shook her head .
i do not get on at all .
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .
i can readily believe , answered he gravely , that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .
but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity .
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied .
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; and on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .
they had not long separated , when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her : so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you , among his other communication , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcys steward .
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcys using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourites guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better .
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , said elizabeth angrily ; for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcys steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself .
i beg your pardon , replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant .
insolent girl !
said elizabeth to herself .
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy .
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness .
i want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters , what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon .
no , replied jane , i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity , and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcys regard .
mr .
bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ?
no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton .
this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
i am satisfied .
but what does he say of the living ?
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .
i have not a doubt of mr. bingleys sincerity , said elizabeth warmly ; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
mr. bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one , i dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before .
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr. bingleys regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
i have found out , said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy !
indeed i am .
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew .
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight .
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme , assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ; and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .
mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus : my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ; but permit me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology , hunsford , and lady catherine de bourgh .
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .
mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
i have no reason , i assure you , said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
it was really a very handsome thought .
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him .
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
she saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters .
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely , openly , and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr. bingley .
it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of selfgratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life .
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for , to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .
for heavens sake , madam , speak lower .
what advantage can it be for you to offend mr. darcy ?
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing !
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
at length , however , mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
elizabeth now began to revive .
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for , when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations , and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving , amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .
elizabeth was in agonies .
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued , however , imperturbably grave .
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , that will do extremely well , child .
you have delighted us long enough .
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her fathers speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
others of the party were now applied to .
if i , said mr. collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
i do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
the rector of a parish has much to do .
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family .
and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
many staredmany smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .
to elizabeth it appeared that , had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations , was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
she was teased by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
he assured her , that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
there was no arguing upon such a project .
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and goodnaturedly engaged mr. collinss conversation to herself .
she was at least free from the offense of mr. darcys further notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart , and , by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet , had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths , except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
darcy said nothing at all .
mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .
mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord , how tired i am !
accompanied by a violent yawn .
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn , and addressed herself especially to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied , and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months .
of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .
mr. collins made his declaration in form .
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances , which he supposed a regular part of the business .
on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words : may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?
before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet answered instantly , oh dear !
yescertainly .
i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection .
come , kitty , i want you up stairs .
and , gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out : dear madam , do not go .
i beg you will not go .
mr. collins must excuse me .
he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear .
i am going away myself .
no , no , nonsense , lizzy .
i desire you to stay where you are .
and upon elizabeths seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added : lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr. collins .
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again and tried to conceal , by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone , mr. collins began .
believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that i have your respected mothers permission for this address .
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
almost as soon as i entered the house , i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand , moreover , for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did .
the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing , that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further , and he continued : my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too !
on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool , that she said , mr .
collins , you must marry .
a clergyman like you must marry .
choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .
this is my advice .
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .
allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , i think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i can assure you there are many amiable young women .
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who , however , may live many years longer , i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes placewhich , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mothers decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
you are too hasty , sir , she cried .
you forget that i have made no answer .
let me do it without further loss of time .
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them .
i am not now to learn , replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time .
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .
upon my word , sir , cried elizabeth , your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration .
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .
you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so .
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .
were it certain that lady catherine would think so , said mr. collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again , i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualification .
indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any selfreproach .
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had mr. collins not thus addressed her : when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .
really , mr. collins , cried elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one .
you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration , that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .
i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
my feelings in every respect forbid it .
can i speak plainer ?
do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you , but as a rational creature , speaking the truth from her heart .
you are uniformly charming !
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfastroom , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .
but , depend upon it , mr. collins , she added , that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
i will speak to her about it directly .
she is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it .
pardon me for interrupting you , madam , cried mr. collins ; but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .
sir , you quite misunderstand me , said mrs. bennet , alarmed .
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived .
i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure .
she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , oh !
mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
i have not the pleasure of understanding you , said he , when she had finished her speech .
of what are you talking ?
of mr. collins and lizzy .
lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy .
and what am i to do on the occasion ?
it seems an hopeless business .
speak to lizzy about it yourself .
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .
let her be called down .
she shall hear my opinion .
mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .
come here , child , cried her father as she appeared .
i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .
is it true ?
elizabeth replied that it was .
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused ?
i have , sir .
very well .
we now come to the point .
your mother insists upon your accepting it .
is it not so , mrs. bennet ?
yes , or i will never see her again .
an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do .
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning , but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .
what do you mean , mr. bennet , in talking this way ?
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him .
my dear , replied her husband , i have two small favours to request .
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .
not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest ; but jane , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and elizabeth , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to her attacks .
though her manner varied , however , her determination never did .
mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !
what do you think has happened this morning ?
mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him .
charlotte hardly had time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
pray do , my dear miss lucas , she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me .
i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .
charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
aye , there she comes , continued mrs. bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .
but i tell you , miss lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .
i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you .
i have done with you from this very day .
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
not that i have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody .
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
nobody can tell what i suffer !
but it is always so .
those who do not complain are never pitied .
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation .
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them , till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered the room with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let me and mr. collins have a little conversation together .
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet began the projected conversation : oh !
mr. collins !
my dear madam , replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .
far be it from me , he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
you will not , i hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
my conduct may , i fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own .
but we are all liable to error .
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise .
the discussion of mr. collinss offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother .
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennets illhumour or ill health .
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he meant to stay .
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .
he joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation , and the concern of everybody , was well talked over .
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed .
i found , said he , as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .
she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her .
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield .
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hotpressed paper , well covered with a ladys fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
when they had gained their own room , jane , taking out the letter , said : this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains has surprised me a good deal .
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back again .
you shall hear what she says .
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .
the next was in these words : i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
i depend on you for that .
to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingleys being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .
it is unlucky , said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them .
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .
i will read it to you : when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter ; i wish that i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i despair .
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you .
it is evident by this , added jane , that he comes back no more this winter .
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should .
why will you think so ?
it must be his own doing .
he is his own master .
but you do not know all .
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
i will have no reserves from you .
mr .
darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and , to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject ; but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
my brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sisters partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart .
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?
what do you think of this sentence , my dear lizzy ?
said jane as she finished it .
is it not clear enough ?
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means most kindly !
to put me on my guard ?
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?
yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .
will you hear it ?
most willingly .
you shall have it in a few words .
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .
she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .
jane shook her head .
indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection .
miss bingley , i am sure , cannot .
she is not such a simpleton .
could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
but the case is this : we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .
if we thought alike of miss bingley , replied jane , your representation of all this might make me quite easy .
but i know the foundation is unjust .
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself .
that is right .
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .
believe her to be deceived , by all means .
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .
but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?
you must decide for yourself , said elizabeth ; and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him .
how can you talk so ?
said jane , faintly smiling .
you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate .
i did not think you would ; and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion .
but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .
a thousand things may arise in six months !
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
janes temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .
after lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .
it keeps him in good humour , said she , and i am more obliged to you than i can express .
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
this was very amiable , but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr. collinss addresses , by engaging them towards herself .
such was miss lucass scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .
his reception , however , was of the most flattering kind .
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .
in as short a time as mr. collinss long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .
mr. collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .
lady lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st .
jamess .
the whole family , in short , were properly overjoyed on the occasion .
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid .
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .
her reflections were in general satisfactory .
mr. collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
but still he would be her husband .
without thinking highly either of men or matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twentyseven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation .
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins , when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them .
my dear madam , he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .
they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said : but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here , my good sir ?
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness .
my dear sir , replied mr. collins , i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence .
you cannot be too much upon your guard .
risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .
believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth .
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return .
mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion .
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
the possibility of mr. collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out : engaged to mr. collins !
my dear charlotteimpossible !
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied : why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?
do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?
but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
i see what you are feeling , replied charlotte .
you must be surprised , very much surprisedso lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .
but when you have had time to think it over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .
i am not romantic , you know ; i never was .
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collinss character , connection , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly ; and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
the strangeness of mr. collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
charlotte the wife of mr. collins was a most humiliating picture !
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family .
with many compliments to them , and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed : good lord !
sir william , how can you tell such a story ?
do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ?
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
nothing could console and nothing could appease her .
nor did that day wear out her resentment .
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
mr. bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted .
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
mr. collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
on the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingleys continued absence .
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness , and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently occurring .
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than elizabeths , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .
it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company .
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
whenever charlotte came to see them , she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
indeed , mr. bennet , said she , it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take her place in it !
my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .
let us hope for better things .
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor .
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before .
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .
if it was not for the entail , i should not mind it .
what should not you mind ?
i should not mind anything at all .
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .
i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for anything about the entail .
how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters , i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr. collins too !
why should he have it more than anybody else ?
i leave it to yourself to determine , said mr. bennet .
miss bingleys letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it .
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr. darcys house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all others .
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination .
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best , but her sisters was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .
she could think of nothing else ; and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends interference ; whether he had been aware of janes attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whatever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sisters situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last , on mrs. bennets leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying : oh , that my dear mother had more command over herself !
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .
but i will not repine .
it cannot last long .
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .
you doubt me , cried jane , slightly colouring ; indeed , you have no reason .
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .
thank god !
i have not that pain .
a little time , thereforei shall certainly try to get the better .
with a stronger voice she soon added , i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself .
my dear jane !
exclaimed elizabeth , you are too good .
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection .
nay , said elizabeth , this is not fair .
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody .
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill .
you need not .
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense .
i have met with two instances lately , one i will not mention ; the other is charlottes marriage .
it is unaccountable !
in every view it is unaccountable !
my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .
they will ruin your happiness .
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .
consider mr. collinss respectability , and charlottes steady , prudent character .
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybodys sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .
to oblige you , i would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart .
my dear jane , mr. collins is a conceited , pompous , narrowminded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking .
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness .
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , replied jane ; and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together .
but enough of this .
you alluded to something else .
you mentioned two instances .
i cannot misunderstand you , but i entreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .
women fancy admiration means more than it does .
and men take care that they should .
if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .
i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingleys conduct to design , said elizabeth ; but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other peoples feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .
and do you impute it to either of those ?
yes ; to the last .
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .
stop me whilst you can .
you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ?
yes , in conjunction with his friend .
i cannot believe it .
why should they try to influence him ?
they can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .
your first position is false .
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .
beyond a doubt , they do wish him to choose miss darcy , replied jane ; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers .
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .
by supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .
do not distress me by the idea .
i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor , at least , it is light , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr. bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .
mrs. bennets best comfort was that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer .
mr. bennet treated the matter differently .
so , lizzy , said he one day , your sister is crossed in love , i find .
i congratulate her .
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then .
it is something to think of , and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .
when is your turn to come ?
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .
now is your time .
here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .
let wickham be your man .
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .
thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
we must not all expect janes good fortune .
true , said mr. bennet , but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it .
mr. wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr. darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known anything of the matter .
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride ; as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .
on the following monday , mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .
mr. gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so wellbred and agreeable .
mrs. gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. phillips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a particular regard .
they had frequently been staying with her in town .
the first part of mrs. gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .
when this was done she had a less active part to play .
it became her turn to listen .
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .
they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister .
two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .
i do not blame jane , she continued , for jane would have got mr. bingley if she could .
but lizzy !
oh , sister !
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collinss wife by this time , had it not been for her own perverseness .
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .
they are all for what they can get .
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .
mrs. gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and , in compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation .
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , said she .
i am sorry it went off .
but these things happen so often !
a young man , such as you describe mr. bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent .
an excellent consolation in its way , said elizabeth , but it will not do for us .
we do not suffer by accident .
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .
pray , how violent was mr. bingleys love ?
i never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance ; and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .
could there be finer symptoms ?
is not general incivility the very essence of love ?
oh , yes !
ofthat kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .
poor jane !
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .
it had better have happened to you , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ?
change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything .
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence .
i hope , added mrs. gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable that they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .
and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?
mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him .
so much the better .
i hope they will not meet at all .
but does not jane correspond with his sister ?
she will not be able to help calling .
she will drop the acquaintance entirely .
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be reanimated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions .
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time , than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn ; and what with the phillipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of itof which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation , narrowly observed them both .
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged .
they had , therefore , many acquaintances in common ; and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring .
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well .
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .
on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcys treatment of him , she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it , and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , illnatured boy .
mrs. gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .
i have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .
but as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you .
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure .
you must not disappoint your father .
my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .
yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise .
well , then , you need not be under any alarm .
i will take care of myself , and of mr. wickham too .
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it .
elizabeth , you are not serious now .
i beg your pardon , i will try again .
at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ; no , i certainly am not .
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not .
i see the imprudence of it .
oh !
that abominable mr. darcy !
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour , and i should be miserable to forfeit it .
my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .
in short , i will do my best .
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often .
at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him .
as i did the other day , said elizabeth with a conscious smile : very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .
you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be the wisest ; and now i hope you are satisfied .
her aunt assured her that she was , and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet .
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an illnatured tone , that she wished they might be happy .
thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .
as they went downstairs together , charlotte said : i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza .
that you certainly shall .
and i have another favour to ask you .
will you come and see me ?
we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire .
i am not likely to leave kent for some time .
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford .
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .
my father and maria are coming to me in march , added charlotte , and i hope you will consent to be of the party .
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome as either of them .
the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and everybody had as much to say , or to hear , on the subject as usual .
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging .
it was mr. collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest .
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline .
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost .
my aunt , she continued , is going tomorrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street .
she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley .
i did not think caroline in spirits , were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .
i was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her .
i inquired after their brother , of course .
he was well , but so much engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him .
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .
i wish i could see her .
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out .
i dare say i shall see them soon here .
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sisters being in town .
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him .
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention .
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt .
my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me .
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again .
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the meantime .
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her .
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side .
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
i need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago .
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .
i cannot understand it .
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happyyour affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .
let me hear from you very soon .
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .
we had better not mention it .
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .
yours ,etc .
this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .
she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions .
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcys sister , as by wickhams account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards miss king .
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .
there can be no love in all this .
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain .
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away .
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr. collins .
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .
everything , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch .
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a goodhumoured girl , but as emptyheaded as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir williams too long .
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon .
as they drove to mr. gardiners door , jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .
all was joy and kindness .
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .
their first object was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .
it was reasonable , however , to hope that they would not continue long .
mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .
but my dear elizabeth , she added , what sort of girl is miss king ?
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .
pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think .
she is a very good kind of girl , i believe .
i know no harm of her .
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune .
nowhy should he ?
if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?
but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event .
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .
if she does not object to it , why should we ?
her not objecting does not justify him .
it only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling .
well , cried elizabeth , have it as you choose .
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .
no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose .
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire .
oh !
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .
i am sick of them all .
thank heaven !
i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .
take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment .
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
we have not determined how far it shall carry us , said mrs. gardiner , but , perhaps , to the lakes .
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .
oh , my dear , dear aunt , she rapturously cried , what delight !
what felicity !
you give me fresh life and vigour .
adieu to disappointment and spleen .
what are young men to rocks and mountains ?
oh !
what hours of transport we shall spend !
and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything .
we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen .
lakes , mountains , and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarreling about its relative situation .
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side .
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .
at length the parsonage was discernible .
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales , and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving .
mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received .
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family .
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment .
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .
but though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance , and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion .
when mr. collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .
to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country or kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .
from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help .
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .
when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really an air of great comfort throughout , and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr. collins joining in , observed : yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .
her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us .
i should say , one of her ladyships carriages , for she has several .
lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .
very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had already been written ; and when it closed , elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .
a lively imagination soon settled it all .
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out oh , my dear eliza !
pray make haste and come into the diningroom , for there is such a sight to be seen !
i will not tell you what it is .
make haste , and come down this moment .
elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the diningroom , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .
and is this all ?
cried elizabeth .
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter .
la !
my dear , said maria , quite shocked at the mistake , it is not lady catherine .
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson , who lives with them ; the other is miss de bourgh .
only look at her .
she is quite a little creature .
who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ?
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .
why does she not come in ?
oh , charlotte says she hardly ever does .
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in .
i like her appearance , said elizabeth , struck with other ideas .
she looks sickly and cross .
yes , she will do for him very well .
she will make him a very proper wife .
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeths high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .
mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .
mr. collinss triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete .
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherines condescension , as he knew not how to admire enough .
i confess , said he , that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation , moreover , including the whole party so immediately after your arrival !
i am the less surprised at what has happened , replied sir william , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings .
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner , might not wholly overpower them .
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter .
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more .
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .
while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .
such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st .
jamess .
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .
every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .
when they ascended the steps to the hall , marias alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .
elizabeths courage did not fail her .
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .
from the entrancehall , of which mr. collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and the finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs. jenkinson were sitting .
her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .
in spite of having been at st .
jamess , sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with stronglymarked features , which might once have been handsome .
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her selfimportance , and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeths mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented .
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small .
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies .
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs. jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyships desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .
the party did not supply much conversation .
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime .
mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she was indisposed .
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner , as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted .
she inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs. collins was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .
she asked her , at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mothers maiden name ?
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly .
lady catherine then observed , your fathers estate is entailed on mr. collins , i think .
for your sake , turning to charlotte , i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family .
do you play and sing , miss bennet ?
a little .
oh !
thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you .
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior toyou shall try it some day .
do your sisters play and sing ?
one of them does .
why did not you all learn ?
you ought all to have learned .
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours .
do you draw ?
no , not at all .
what , none of you ?
not one .
that is very strange .
but i suppose you had no opportunity .
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .
my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london .
has your governess left you ?
we never had any governess .
no governess !
how was that possible ?
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !
i never heard of such a thing .
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case .
then , who taught you ?
who attended to you ?
without a governess , you must have been neglected .
compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means .
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .
those who chose to be idle , certainly might .
aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .
four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .
mrs. collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me ?
she finds miss pope a treasure .
lady catherine , said she , you have given me a treasure .
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?
yes , maam , all .
all !
what , all five out at once ?
very odd !
and you only the second .
the younger ones out before the elder ones are married !
your younger sisters must be very young ?
yes , my youngest is not sixteen .
perhaps she is full young to be much in company .
but really , maam , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .
the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first .
and to be kept back on such a motive !
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .
upon my word , said her ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .
pray , what is your age ?
with three younger sisters grown up , replied elizabeth , smiling , your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age .
i am not oneandtwenty .
when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the cardtables were placed .
lady catherine , sir william , and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party .
their table was superlatively stupid .
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .
a great deal more passed at the other table .
lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .
mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .
sir william did not say much .
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broken up , the carriage was offered to mrs. collins , gratefully accepted and immediately ordered .
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed .
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlottes sake , she made more favourable than it really was .
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr. collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands .
sir william stayed only a week at hunsford , but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .
while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing , and looking out of the window in his own bookroom , which fronted the road .
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a more pleasant aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out .
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture ; or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collinss joints of meat were too large for her family .
elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one cardtable in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .
their other engagements were few , as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collinss reach .
this , however , was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity .
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage ; for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it , and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle lord  , and , to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him .
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding : i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .
mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the doorbell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .
mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs. collins , and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word .
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody .
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moments pause , added : my eldest sister has been in town these three months .
have you never happened to see her there ?
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane , and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings .
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easterday , almost a week after the gentlemens arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .
for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter .
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr. darcy they had seen only at church .
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom .
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out : what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?
what is it you are talking of ?
what are you telling miss bennet ?
let me hear what it is .
we are speaking of music , madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
of music !
then pray speak aloud .
it is of all subjects my delight .
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music .
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient .
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .
how does georgiana get on , darcy ?
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency .
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said lady catherine ; and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal .
i assure you , madam , he replied , that she does not need such advice .
she practises very constantly .
so much the better .
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice .
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well unless she practises more ; and though mrs. collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in mrs. jenkinsons room .
she would be in nobodys way , you know , in that part of the house .
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding , and made no answer .
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .
he drew a chair near her .
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance .
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said : you mean to frighten me , mr. darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?
i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .
my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me .
i shall not say you are mistaken , he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .
indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand , give me leave to say , very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear .
i am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly .
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried colonel fitzwilliam .
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers .
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful .
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a balland at this ball , what do you think he did ?
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .
mr. darcy , you cannot deny the fact .
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .
true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom .
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ?
my fingers wait your orders .
perhaps , said darcy , i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction ; but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers .
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?
i can answer your question , said fitzwilliam , without applying to him .
it is because he will not give himself the trouble .
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said darcy , of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done .
my fingers , said elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do .
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .
but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the trouble of practising .
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution .
darcy smiled and said , you are perfectly right .
you have employed your time much better .
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting .
we neither of us perform to strangers .
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .
elizabeth immediately began playing again .
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy : miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to annes .
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility , and , at the request of the gentlemen , remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home .
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and , to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within .
they then sat down , and when her inquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed : how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ?
perfectly so , i thank you .
she found that she was to receive no other answer , and , after a short pause added : i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?
i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future .
he has many friends , and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .
if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
but , perhaps , mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle .
i should not be surprised , said darcy , if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers .
elizabeth made no answer .
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
he took the hint , and soon began with , this seems a very comfortable house .
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford .
i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .
mr .
collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife .
yes , indeed , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .
my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her .
it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .
an easy distance , do you call it ?
it is nearly fifty miles .
and what is fifty miles of good road ?
little more than half a days journey .
yes , i call it a very easy distance .
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , cried elizabeth .
i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family .
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far .
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered : i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .
where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .
but that is not the case here .
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .
you cannot have been always at longbourn .
elizabeth looked surprised .
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and glancing over it , said , in a colder voice : are you pleased with kent ?
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from her walk .
the ttette surprised them .
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody , went away .
what can be the meaning of this ?
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
my dear , eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called us in this familiar way .
but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlottes wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .
all field sports were over .
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiardtable , but gentlemen cannot always be within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .
he seldom appeared really animated .
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out .
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friends dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .
more than once did elizabeth , in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought , and , to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
how it could occur a second time , therefore , was very odd !
yet it did , and even a third .
it seemed like wilful illnature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collinss happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
his words seemed to imply it .
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
she supposed , if he meant anything , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
she was engaged one day as she walked , in perusing janes last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said : i did not know before that you ever walked this way .
i have been making the tour of the park , he replied , as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .
are you going much farther ?
no , i should have turned in a moment .
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .
do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?
said she .
yesif darcy does not put it off again .
but i am at his disposal .
he arranges the business just as he pleases .
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice .
i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy .
he likes to have his own way very well , replied colonel fitzwilliam .
but so we all do .
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .
i speak feelingly .
a younger son , you know , must be inured to selfdenial and dependence .
in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
now seriously , what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence ?
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring anything you had a fancy for ?
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from want of money .
younger sons cannot marry where they like .
unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do .
our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .
is this , thought elizabeth , meant for me ?
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , and pray , what is the usual price of an earls younger son ?
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .
he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said : i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal .
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
but , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .
no , said colonel fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy .
are you indeed ?
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
does your charge give you much trouble ?
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly ; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
she directly replied : you need not be frightened .
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
i think i have heard you say that you know them .
i know them a little .
their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys .
oh !
yes , said elizabeth drily ; mr .
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .
care of him !
yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
it was all conjecture .
what is it you mean ?
it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the ladys family , it would be an unpleasant thing .
you may depend upon my not mentioning it .
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
what he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .
did mr. darcy give you reasons for this interference ?
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .
and what arts did he use to separate them ?
he did not talk to me of his own arts , said fitzwilliam , smiling .
he only told me what i have now told you .
elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
i am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she .
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings .
why was he to be the judge ?
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?
i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination , or why , upon his own judgement alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy .
but , she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .
that is not an unnatural surmise , said fitzwilliam , but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly .
this was spoken jestingly ; but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer , and therefore , abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage .
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause , of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
there were some very strong objections against the lady , were colonel fitzwilliams words ; and those strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .
to jane herself , she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection ; all loveliness and goodness as she is !
herunderstanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .
when she thought of her mother , her confidence gave way a little ; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening , that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home .
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone , had been scarcely ever clouded .
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
mr. darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings .
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the nextand , a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her .
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
she answered him with cold civility .
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up , walked about the room .
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .
after a silence of several minutes , he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began : in vain i have struggled .
it will not do .
my feelings will not be repressed .
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you .
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression .
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .
this he considered sufficient encouragement ; and the avowal of all that he felt , and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
he spoke well ; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed ; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and , when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said : in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .
but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone .
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .
mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it .
the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful .
at length , with a voice of forced calmness , he said : and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .
but it is of small importance .
i might as well inquire , replied she , why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?
but i have other provocations .
you know i have .
had not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?
as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued : i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
you dare not , you cannot deny , that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
can you deny that you have done it ?
she repeated .
with assumed tranquillity he then replied : i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself .
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .
but it is not merely this affair , she continued , on which my dislike is founded .
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided .
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
on this subject , what can you have to say ?
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ?
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns , said darcy , in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?
his misfortunes !
repeated darcy contemptuously ; yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .
and of your infliction , cried elizabeth with energy .
you have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty .
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him .
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
you have done all this !
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule .
and this , cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !
this is the estimation in which you hold me !
i thank you for explaining it so fully .
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
but perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offenses might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything .
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
they were natural and just .
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
tocongratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said : you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner .
she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued : you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
she went on : from the very beginningfrom the first moment , i may almost sayof my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry .
you have said quite enough , madam .
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .
and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
the tumult of her mind , was now painfully great .
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour .
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost incredible !
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
but his pride , his abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation , and hurried her away to her room .
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of anything else ; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved , soon after breakfast , to indulge herself in air and exercise .
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcys sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led farther from the turnpikeroad .
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and , fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .
she had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .
he had by that time reached it also , and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?
and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and , to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper , written quite through , in a very close hand .
the envelope itself was likewise full .
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .
it was dated from rosings , at eight oclock in the morning , and was as follows : be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you .
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .
two offenses of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in the future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
if , in the explanation of them , which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , i can only say that i am sorry .
the necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd .
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .
i had often seen him in love before .
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucass accidental information , that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .
your sister i also watched .
her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in error .
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
these causes must be stated , though briefly .
the situation of your mothers family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .
pardon me .
it pains me to offend you .
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .
the part which i acted is now to be explained .
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered , and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .
we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice .
i described , and enforced them earnestly .
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving , of your sisters indifference .
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own .
to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town .
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
perhaps this concealment , this disguise was beneath me ; it is done , however , and it was done for the best .
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .
if i have wounded your sisters feelings , it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
mr .
wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on george wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education .
my father was not only fond of this young mans society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell .
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive .
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowand if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant .
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .
he had some intention , he added , of studying law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman ; the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions .
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition to it .
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself .
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped .
how he lived i know not .
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
mr. wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement .
his revenge would have been complete indeed .
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ; but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
for the truth of everything here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and , still more , as one of the executors of my fathers will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
i will only add , god bless you .
fitzwilliam darcy if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
but such as they were , it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
it was all pride and insolence .
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , this must be false !
this cannot be !
this must be the grossest falsehood !
andwhen she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .
so far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
but when she read and reread with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success .
on both sides it was only assertion .
again she read on ; but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr. darcys conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr. wickhams charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring .
his countenance , voice , and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
but no such recollection befriended her .
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .
but , alas !
the story which followed , of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration .
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. phillipss .
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcythat mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .
she remembered also that , till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcys character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son .
how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned !
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything .
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown .
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling ; that had his actions been what mr. wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
how despicably i have acted !
she cried ; i , who have prided myself on my discernment !
i , who have valued myself on my abilities !
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust !
how humiliating is this discovery !
yet , how just a humiliation !
had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind !
but vanity , not love , has been my folly .
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .
till this moment i never knew myself .
from herself to janefrom jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient , and she read it again .
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?
he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment ; and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been .
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .
she felt that janes feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility .
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt .
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thoughtreconsidering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself , as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr. darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object ; she could think only of her letter .
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning , and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .
to rosings he then hastened , to console lady catherine and her daughter ; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyships indignation would have been .
what would she have said ?
how would she have behaved ?
were questions with which she amused herself .
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .
i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , said lady catherine ; i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do .
but i am particularly attached to these young men , and know them to be so much attached to me !
they were excessively sorry to go !
but so they always are .
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more , i think , than last year .
his attachment to rosings certainly increases .
mr. collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it by herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added : but if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer .
mrs. collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure .
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .
i must be in town next saturday .
why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .
i expected you to stay two months .
i told mrs. collins so before you came .
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .
mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .
but my father cannot .
he wrote last week to hurry my return .
oh !
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox , there will be very good room for one of youand indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .
you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan .
lady catherine seemed resigned .
mrs .
collins , you must send a servant with them .
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .
it is highly improper .
you must contrive to send somebody .
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two menservants go with her .
miss darcy , the daughter of mr. darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .
i am excessively attentive to all those things .
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs. collins .
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .
my uncle is to send a servant for us .
oh !
your uncle !
he keeps a manservant , does he ?
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things .
where shall you change horses ?
oh !
bromley , of course .
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to .
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .
mr. darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .
she studied every sentence ; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
they were hopeless of remedy .
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?
catherine , weakspirited , irritable , and completely under lydias guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , selfwilled and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .
they were ignorant , idle , and vain .
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there forever .
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern ; and mr. darcys explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost .
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !
when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first .
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .
i know not , miss elizabeth , said he , whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .
we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode .
our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .
mr. collins was gratified , and with a more smiling solemnity replied : it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and , from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .
our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .
you see on what a footing we are .
you see how continually we are engaged there .
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings .
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .
you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .
lady catherines great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent .
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .
we seem to have been designed for each other .
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang .
poor charlotte !
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !
but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins , and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner , though unknown .
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings .
but , he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .
elizabeth made no objection ; the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .
good gracious !
cried maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !
and yet how many things have happened !
a great many indeed , said her companion with a sigh .
we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !
how much i shall have to tell !
elizabeth added privately , and how much i shall have to conceal !
their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiners house , where they were to remain a few days .
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .
it was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. darcys proposals .
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further .
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of  , in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennets carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachmans punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs .
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a salad and cucumber .
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , is not this nice ?
is not this an agreeable surprise ?
and we mean to treat you all , added lydia , but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .
then , showing her purchaseslook here , i have bought this bonnet .
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not .
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better .
and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , oh !
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable .
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .
are they indeed !
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .
they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !
it would be such a delicious scheme ; and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all .
mamma would like to go too of all things !
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !
yes , thought elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme indeed , and completely do for us at once .
good heaven !
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton !
now i have got some news for you , said lydia , as they sat down at table .
what do you think ?
it is excellent newscapital newsand about a certain person we all like !
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told he need not stay .
lydia laughed , and said : aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .
but he is an ugly fellow !
i am glad he is gone .
i never saw such a long chin in my life .
well , but now for my news ; it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is it not ?
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king .
theres for you !
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool : gone to stay .
wickham is safe .
and mary king is safe !
added elizabeth ; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .
she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said jane .
i am sure there is not on his .
i will answer for it , he never cared three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?
elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal !
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases , were seated in it .
how nicely we are all crammed in , cried lydia .
i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away .
have you seen any pleasant men ?
have you had any flirting ?
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .
she is almost threeandtwenty !
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty !
my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands , you cant think .
she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it .
lord !
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .
dear me !
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters .
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; by the bye , mrs. forster and me are such friends !
and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?
we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun !
not a soul knew of it , but colonel and mrs. forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .
lord !
how i laughed !
and so did mrs. forster .
i thought i should have died .
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .
with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kittys hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name .
their reception at home was most kind .
mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth : i am glad you are come back , lizzy .
their party in the diningroom was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects that occupied them : lady lucas was inquiring of maria , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and , on the other , retailing them all to the younger lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other persons , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her .
oh !
mary , said she , i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !
as we went along , kitty and i drew up the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .
and then when we came away it was such fun !
i thought we never should have got into the coach .
i was ready to die of laughter .
and then we were so merry all the way home !
we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off !
to this mary very gravely replied , far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures !
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .
but i confess they would have no charms for mei should infinitely prefer a book .
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton , and to see how everybody went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .
there was another reason too for her opposition .
she dreaded seeing mr. wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .
the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression .
in a fortnight they were to goand once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length , resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .
she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him .
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong , said she , and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment !
indeed , replied elizabeth , i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?
blame you !
oh , no .
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham ?
noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .
but you will know it , when i tell you what happened the very next day .
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .
what a stroke was this for poor jane !
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .
nor was darcys vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear the one without involving the other .
this will not do , said elizabeth ; you never will be able to make both of them good for anything .
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all darcys ; but you shall do as you choose .
it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .
i do not know when i have been more shocked , said she .
wickham so very bad !
it is almost past belief .
and poor mr. darcy !
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .
such a disappointment !
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too !
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
it is really too distressing .
i am sure you must feel it so .
oh !
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .
poor wickham !
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !
such an openness and gentleness in his manner !
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .
i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .
it is such a spur to ones genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind .
one may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .
lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .
indeed , i could not .
i was uncomfortable enough , i may say unhappy .
and with no one to speak to about what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !
oh !
how i wanted you !
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .
certainly .
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
there is one point on which i want your advice .
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand wickhams character .
miss bennet paused a little , and then replied , surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
what is your opinion ?
that it ought not to be attempted .
mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
on the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
i am not equal to it .
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is .
some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
at present i will say nothing about it .
you are quite right .
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
he is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to reestablish a character .
we must not make him desperate .
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation .
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure .
she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcys letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend .
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery .
and then , said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits .
jane was not happy .
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and , from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
well , lizzy , said mrs. bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes ?
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
i told my sister phillips so the other day .
but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london .
well , he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know .
i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more .
oh well !
it is just as he chooses .
nobody wants him to come .
though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart ; and then he will be sorry for what he has done .
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
well , lizzy , continued her mother , soon afterwards , and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?
well , well , i only hope it will last .
and what sort of table do they keep ?
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say .
no , nothing at all .
a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
yes , yes .
they will take care not to outrun their income .
they will never be distressed for money .
well , much good may it do them !
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
they look upon it as quite their own , i dare say , whenever that happens .
it was a subject which they could not mention before me .
no ; it would have been strange if they had ; but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves .
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .
the first week of their return was soon gone .
the second began .
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
the dejection was almost universal .
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family .
good heaven !
what is to become of us ?
what are we to do ?
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , fiveandtwenty years ago .
i am sure , said she , i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away .
i thought i should have broken my heart .
i am sure i shall break mine , said lydia .
if one could but go to brighton !
observed mrs. bennet .
oh , yes !
ifone could but go to brighton !
but papa is so disagreeable .
a little seabathing would set me up forever .
and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , added kitty .
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house .
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcys objections ; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two .
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyones congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia , said she , though i am not her particular friend .
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older .
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .
he heard her attentively , and then said : lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .
if you were aware , said elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent mannernay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair .
already arisen ?
repeated mr. bennet .
what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
poor little lizzy !
but do not be cast down .
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret .
come , let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly .
indeed you are mistaken .
i have no such injuries to resent .
it is not of particular , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .
our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character .
excuse me , for i must speak plainly .
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .
in this danger kitty also is comprehended .
she will follow wherever lydia leads .
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled !
oh !
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject , and affectionately taking her hand said in reply : do not make yourself uneasy , my love .
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say , threevery silly sisters .
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .
let her go , then .
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody .
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .
the officers will find women better worth their notice .
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life .
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them .
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .
in lydias imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .
she saw , with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers .
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .
she saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and , to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .
had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself .
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of lydias leaving home .
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time .
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .
on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton , he dined , with other of the officers , at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr. darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him , if he was acquainted with the former .
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moments recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him .
her answer was warmly in his favour .
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added : how long did you say he was at rosings ?
nearly three weeks .
and you saw him frequently ?
yes , almost every day .
his manners are very different from his cousins .
yes , very different .
but i think mr. darcy improves upon acquaintance .
indeed !
cried mr. wickham with a look which did not escape her .
and pray , may i ask ?
but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , is it in address that he improves ?
has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ?
fori dare not hope , he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .
oh , no !
said elizabeth .
in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was .
while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added : when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent , till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents : you , who so well know my feeling towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe .
his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart .
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .
mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .
her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .
respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .
but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband .
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents ; talents , which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .
their parties abroad were less varied than before , and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp .
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .
but it is fortunate , thought she , that i have something to wish for .
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised .
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn .
everything wore a happier aspect .
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .
mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of june , kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching , and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month , and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour , and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire .
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough .
but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected .
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .
but surely , said she , i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .
the period of expectation was now doubled .
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival .
but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them , playing with them , and loving them .
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenilworth , birmingham , etc .
are sufficiently known .
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiners former residence , and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated .
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .
mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .
my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?
said her aunt ; a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected .
wickham passed all his youth there , you know .
elizabeth was distressed .
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .
she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she , i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .
they have some of the finest woods in the country .
elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce .
the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .
it would be dreadful !
she blushed at the very idea , and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk .
but against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered .
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place ?
what was the name of its proprietor ?
and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer ?
a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent .
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .
they gradually ascended for halfamile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .
it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned .
elizabeth was delighted .
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned .
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .
the housekeeper came ; a respectablelooking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .
they followed her into the diningparlour .
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .
the hill , crowned with wood , which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .
and of this place , thought she , i might have been mistress !
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .
but no ,recollecting herselfthat could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; i should not have been allowed to invite them .
this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like regret .
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent , but had not the courage for it .
at length however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied that he was , adding , but we expect him tomorrow , with a large party of friends .
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .
she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantelpiece .
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late masters steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense .
he is now gone into the army , she added ; but i am afraid he has turned out very wild .
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .
and that , said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my masterand very like him .
it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago .
i have heard much of your masters fine person , said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; it is a handsome face .
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .
mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
does that young lady know mr. darcy ?
elizabeth coloured , and said : a little .
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , maam ?
yes , very handsome .
i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .
this room was my late masters favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .
he was very fond of them .
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickhams being among them .
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ?
said mrs. gardiner .
oh !
yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !
sheplays and sings all day long .
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master ; she comes here tomorrow with him .
mr. gardiner , whose manners were very easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs. reynolds , either by pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?
not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months .
except , thought elizabeth , when she goes to ramsgate .
if your master would marry , you might see more of him .
yes , sir ; but i do not know when that will be .
i do not know who is good enough for him .
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled .
elizabeth could not help saying , it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so .
i say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , replied the other .
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , i have never known a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old .
this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion .
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying : there are very few people of whom so much can be said .
you are lucky in having such a master .
yes , sir , i know i am .
if i were to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .
but i have always observed , that they who are goodnatured when children , are goodnatured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetesttempered , most generoushearted boy in the world .
elizabeth almost stared at her .
can this be mr. darcy ?
thought she .
his father was an excellent man , said mrs. gardiner .
yes , maam , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor .
elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .
mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point .
she related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .
mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase .
he is the best landlord , and the best master , said she , that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves .
there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name .
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw anything of it .
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .
in what an amiable light does this place him !
thought elizabeth .
this fine account of him , whispered her aunt as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .
perhaps we might be deceived .
that is not very likely ; our authority was too good .
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley .
he is certainly a good brother , said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight , when she should enter the room .
and this is always the way with him , she added .
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment .
there is nothing he would not do for her .
the picturegallery , and two or three of the principal bedrooms , were all that remained to be shown .
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her .
she stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
mrs. reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime .
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeths mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance .
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship !
howmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow !
howmuch of good or evil must be done by him !
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned downstairs , and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the halldoor .
as they walked across the hall towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush .
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .
she had instinctively turned away ; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardeners expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .
amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life .
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her having stayed in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
at length every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .
the others then joined her , and expressed admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most illjudged thing in the world !
how strange it must appear to him !
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
oh !
why did she come ?
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ; for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
and his behaviour , so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean ?
that he should even speak to her was amazing !
butto speak with such civility , to inquire after her family !
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park , when he put his letter into her hand !
she knew not what to think , or how to account for it .
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .
she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him .
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease .
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; when , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .
mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round .
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts .
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it .
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .
the walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
with a glance , she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words delightful , and charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed .
her colour changed , and she said no more .
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself .
what will be his surprise , thought she , when he knows who they are ?
he takes them now for people of fashion .
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it , and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
that he was surprised by the connection was evident ; he sustained it , however , with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .
the conversation soon turned upon fishing ; and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
mrs. gardiner , who was walking arminarm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of wonder .
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .
her astonishment , however , was extreme , and continually was she repeating , why is he so altered ?
from what can it proceed ?
it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
it is impossible that he should still love me .
after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant , there chanced to be a little alteration .
it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husbands .
mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
after a short silence , the lady first spoke .
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper , she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .
he acknowledged the truth of it all , and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
they will join me early tomorrow , he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr .
bingley and his sisters .
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them ; and , if she might judge by his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .
there is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you .
will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?
the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother , and , without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
they now walked on in silence , each of them deep in thought .
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind .
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
at such a time much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .
she wanted to talk , but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject .
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the ttette was over .
on mr. and mrs. gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with utmost politeness .
mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ; and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected .
he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , said her uncle .
there is something a little stately in him , to be sure , replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it .
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling .
to be sure , lizzy , said her aunt , he is not so handsome as wickham ; or , rather , he has not wickhams countenance , for his features are perfectly good .
but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ?
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle .
your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .
elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character , but said nothing .
from what we have seen of him , continued mrs. gardiner , i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham .
he has not an illnatured look .
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .
but , to be sure , the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character !
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickhams so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else .
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcys civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton , these visitors came .
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street .
elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece .
while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing .
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse .
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy .
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .
she was less handsome than her brother ; but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .
they had not long been together before mr. darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .
all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away ; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again .
he inquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done .
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .
they had long wished to see him .
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry ; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors ; she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and , oh !
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner .
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival to jane .
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; and , before she could reply , he added , it is above eight months .
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield .
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn .
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .
their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour ; and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .
presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .
eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .
but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiners curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry .
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .
they could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy .
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight .
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit .
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a wellknown fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out .
she certainly did not hate him .
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked .
it was gratitude ; gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .
such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses .
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .
they were , therefore , to go .
elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon .
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed .
on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .
in this house they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .
georgianas reception of them was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved .
mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and , on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .
it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeablelooking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard .
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
her own thoughts were employing her .
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family .
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .
there was now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches soon collected them round the table .
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .
he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
miss darcy , on her brothers entrance , exerted herself much more to talk , and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility : pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ?
they must be a great loss to your family .
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress ; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone .
while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy , with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement .
to no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
elizabeths collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person , behaviour , and dress .
but georgiana would not join her .
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour ; his judgement could not err .
and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , she cried ; i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .
she is grown so brown and coarse !
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again .
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
for my own part , she rejoined , i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines .
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i could never see anything extraordinary in them .
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .
he was resolutely silent , however , and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued : i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , she a beauty !
ishould as soon call her mother a wit .
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .
yes , replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when i first saw her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .
the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruitof everything but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject .
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .
the one missent must first be attended to ; it had been written five days ago .
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .
it was to this effect : since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well .
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !
imagine our surprise .
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
i am very , very sorry .
so imprudent a match on both sides !
but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart .
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .
our poor mother is sadly grieved .
my father bears it better .
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .
the express was sent off directly .
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written .
without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .
by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .
imprudent as the marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .
though lydias short letter to mrs. f .
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w .
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f .
 ,who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from b .
intending to trace their route .
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no further ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .
i know not what to think .
after making every possible inquiry on that side london , colonel f .
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through .
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f .
 ,but no one can throw any blame on them .
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to everything ?
impossible !
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f .
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w .
was not a man to be trusted .
my poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room .
could she exert herself , it would be better ; but this is not to be expected .
and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one cannot wonder .
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ?
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .
adieu !
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not ; but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible .
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .
what he means to do i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening .
in such an exigence , my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness .
oh !
where , where is my uncle ?
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant , and mr. darcy appeared .
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation , hastily exclaimed , i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .
i must find mr. gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose .
good god !
what is the matter ?
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , i will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant go after mr. and mrs. gardiner .
you are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself .
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home instantly .
on his quitting the room she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , let me call your maid .
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ?
a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ?
you are very ill .
no , i thank you , she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .
there is nothing the matter with me .
i am quite well ; i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn .
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .
at length she spoke again .
i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .
it cannot be concealed from anyone .
my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped ; has thrown herself into the power ofof mr. wickham .
they are gone off together from brighton .
you know him too well to doubt the rest .
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever .
darcy was fixed in astonishment .
when i consider , she added in a yet more agitated voice , that i might have prevented it !
i who knew what he was .
had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt , to my own family !
had his character been known , this could not have happened .
but it is allall too late now .
i am grieved indeed , cried darcy ; grievedshocked .
but is it certainabsolutely certain ?
oh , yes !
they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland .
and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?
my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance ; and we shall be off , i hope , in halfanhour .
but nothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done .
how is such a man to be worked on ?
how are they even to be discovered ?
i have not the smallest hope .
it is every way horrible !
darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence .
when my eyes were opened to his real characteroh !
had i known what i ought , what i dared to do !
but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much .
wretched , wretched mistake !
darcy made no answer .
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation , his brow contracted , his air gloomy .
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .
her power was sinking ; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .
lydiathe humiliation , the misery she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern .
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress !
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today .
oh , yes .
be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy .
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible , i know it cannot be long .
he readily assured her of his secrecy ; again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting look , went away .
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
but if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
never , since reading janes second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her .
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .
surprise was the least of her feelings on this development .
while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible .
but now it was all too natural .
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him ; but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody .
sometimes one officer , sometimes another , had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .
her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object .
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh !
how acutely did she now feel it !
she was wild to be at hometo hear , to see , to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged , a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room her impatience was severe .
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy .
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted .
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner promised every assistance in his power .
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , everything relating to their journey was speedily settled .
they were to be off as soon as possible .
but what is to be done about pemberley ?
cried mrs. gardiner .
john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ?
yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .
that is all settled .
what is all settled ?
repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ?
oh , that i knew how it was !
but wishes were vain , or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .
i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter .
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonels family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?
his temptation is not adequate to the risk !
do you really think so ?
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
upon my word , said mrs. gardiner , i begin to be of your uncles opinion .
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of .
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .
can you yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?
not , perhaps , of neglecting his own interest ; but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .
if , indeed , it should be so !
but i dare not hope it .
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case ?
in the first place , replied mr. gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland .
oh !
but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption !
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road .
well , thensupposing them to be in london .
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purpose .
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london than in scotland .
but why all this secrecy ?
why any fear of detection ?
why must their marriage be private ?
oh , no , nothis is not likely .
his most particular friend , you see by janes account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
he cannot afford it .
and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth , health , and good humour that could make him , for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my fathers behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .
but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage ?
it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
but , really , i know not what to say .
perhaps i am not doing her justice .
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last halfyear , nay , for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head .
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greaterwhat shall i call it ?
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .
but you see that jane , said her aunt , does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt .
of whom does jane ever think ill ?
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating .
and do you really know all this ?
cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
i do indeed , replied elizabeth , colouring .
i told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
yet he knew to the contrary himself .
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .
but does lydia know nothing of this ?
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ?
oh , yes !
that ,that is the worst of all .
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time .
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ?
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
that such a consequence as this could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts .
when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other ?
not the slightest .
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away .
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .
it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent .
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , selfreproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
they travelled as expeditiously as possible , and , sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day .
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ; and , when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them a hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down from her mothers apartment , immediately met her .
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .
not yet , replied jane .
but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well .
is my father in town ?
yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word .
and have you heard from him often ?
we have heard only twice .
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention .
and my motherhow is she ?
how are you all ?
my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .
she does not yet leave her dressingroom .
mary and kitty , thank heaven , are quite well .
but youhow are you ?
cried elizabeth .
you look pale .
how much you must have gone through !
her sister , however , assured her of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party .
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .
when they were all in the drawingroom , the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce their marriage .
mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage ; blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing .
if i had been able , said she , to carry my point in going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after .
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was overruled , as i always am .
poor dear child !
and now heres mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do .
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .
do not give way to useless alarm , added he ; though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .
in a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .
oh !
my dear brother , replied mrs. bennet , that is exactly what i could most wish for .
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married .
and , above all , keep mr. bennet from fighting .
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
oh , brother , how kind you are !
i know you will contrive it all .
but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fear ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table , they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty .
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table : this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of .
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation .
then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible , the former continued the subject , by saying , but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard .
give me further particulars .
what did colonel forster say ?
had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ?
they must have seen them together for ever .
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydias side , but nothing to give him any alarm .
i am so grieved for him !
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?
did he know of their intending to go off ?
had colonel forster seen denny himself ?
yes ; but , when questioned by him , denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it .
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .
and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ?
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ?
i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .
my father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .
but not before they went to brighton ?
no , i believe not .
and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself ?
does he know his real character ?
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false .
oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !
perhaps it would have been better , replied her sister .
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .
we acted with the best intentions .
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife ?
he brought it with him for us to see .
jane then took it from her pocketbook , and gave it to elizabeth .
these were the contents : my dear harriet , you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning , as soon as i am missed .
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham .
what a good joke it will be !
i can hardly write for laughing .
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him tonight .
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up .
goodbye .
give my love to colonel forster .
i hope you will drink to our good journey .
your affectionate friend , lydia bennet .
oh !
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia !
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .
what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment !
but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey .
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .
my poor father !
how he must have felt it !
i never saw anyone so shocked .
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !
oh !
jane , cried elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?
i do not know .
i hope there was .
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult .
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties .
your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
you do not look well .
oh that i had been with you !
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .
mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure ; but i did not think it right for either of them .
kitty is slight and delicate ; and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .
she was of great use and comfort to us all .
and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they should be of use to us .
she had better have stayed at home , cried elizabeth ; perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of ones neighbours .
assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable .
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .
he meant i believe , replied jane , to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them .
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham .
if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .
his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion .
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel .
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom .
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough , as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesmans family .
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday his wife received a letter from him ; it told them that , on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street ; that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon .
there was also a postscript to this effect : i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself .
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .
at present we have nothing to guide us .
colonel forster will , i dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head .
but , on second thoughts , perhaps , lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person .
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved .
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .
the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience .
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .
it was as follows : my dear sir , i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind .
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ?
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last november ; for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .
let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
i am , dear sir , etc .
 ,etc .
mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .
his former acquaintances had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .
there was no one , therefore , who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him .
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount .
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton .
he owed a good deal in town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family .
jane heard them with horror .
a gamester !
she cried .
this is wholly unexpected .
i had not an idea of it .
mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .
rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ?
she cried .
sure he will not leave london before he has found them .
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and the children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world .
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley .
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better .
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
it was not till the afternoon , when he had joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , say nothing of that .
who should suffer but myself ?
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it .
you must not be too severe upon yourself , replied elizabeth .
you may well warn me against such an evil .
human nature is so prone to fall into it !
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .
it will pass away soon enough .
do you suppose them to be in london ?
yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ?
and lydia used to want to go to london , added kitty .
she is happy then , said her father drily ; and her residence there will probably be of some duration .
then after a short silence he continued : lizzy , i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind .
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mothers tea .
this is a parade , he cried , which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can ; or , perhaps , i may defer it till kitty runs away .
i am not going to run away , papa , said kitty fretfully .
if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia .
you go to brighton .
i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds !
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .
no officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village .
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .
well , well , said he , do not make yourself unhappy .
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them .
two days after mr. bennets return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask .
what do you mean , hill ?
we have heard nothing from town .
dear madam , cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , dont you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?
he has been here this halfhour , and master has had a letter .
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said : if you are looking for my master , maam , he is walking towards the little copse .
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
jane , who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out : oh , papa , what newswhat news ?
have you heard from my uncle ?
yes i have had a letter from him by express .
well , and what news does it bringgood or bad ?
what is there of good to be expected ?
said he , taking the letter from his pocket .
but perhaps you would like to read it .
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
jane now came up .
read it aloud , said their father , for i hardly know myself what it is about .
gracechurch street , monday , august 2 .
my dear brother , at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope it will give you satisfaction .
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .
the particulars i reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered .
i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped , cried jane ; they are married !
elizabeth read on : i have seen them both .
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .
these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .
send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .
she comes to us today .
i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on .
yours , etc .
 ,edw .
gardiner .
is it possible ?
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .
can it be possible that he will marry her ?
wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , said her sister .
my dear father , i congratulate you .
and have you answered the letter ?
cried elizabeth .
no ; but it must be done soon .
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .
oh !
my dear father , she cried , come back and write immediately .
consider how important every moment is in such a case .
let me write for you , said jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .
i dislike it very much , he replied ; but it must be done .
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .
and may i ask said elizabeth ; but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with .
complied with !
i am only ashamed of his asking so little .
and they must marry !
yet he is such a man !
yes , yes , they must marry .
there is nothing else to be done .
but there are two things that i want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am i ever to pay him .
money !
my uncle !
cried jane , what do you mean , sir ?
i mean , that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone .
that is very true , said elizabeth ; though it had not occurred to me before .
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !
oh !
it must be my uncles doings !
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .
a small sum could not do all this .
no , said her father ; wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .
ten thousand pounds !
heaven forbid !
how is half such a sum to be repaid ?
mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .
their father then went on to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfastroom .
and they are really to be married !
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .
how strange this is !
and for this we are to be thankful .
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice .
oh , lydia !
i comfort myself with thinking , replied jane , that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her .
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced .
he has children of his own , and may have more .
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?
if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been , said elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .
by this time she is actually with them !
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said jane : i hope and trust they will yet be happy .
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .
their conduct has been such , replied elizabeth , as neither you , nor i , nor anybody can ever forget .
it is useless to talk of it .
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .
he was writing and , without raising his head , coolly replied : just as you please .
may we take my uncles letter to read to her ?
take whatever you like , and get away .
elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable , and they went up stairs together .
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .
mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiners hope of lydias being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation .
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
my dear , dear lydia !
she cried .
this is delightful indeed !
she will be married !
i shall see her again !
she will be married at sixteen !
my good , kind brother !
i knew how it would be .
i knew he would manage everything !
how i long to see her !
and to see dear wickham too !
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .
stay , stay , i will go myself .
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .
i will put on my things in a moment .
my dear , dear lydia !
how merry we shall be together when we meet !
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiners behaviour laid them all under .
for we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added , in a great measure to his kindness .
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money .
well , cried her mother , it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents .
well !
i am so happy !
in a short time i shall have a daughter married .
mrs. wickham !
how well it sounds !
and she was only sixteen last june .
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i cant write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately .
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted .
one days delay , she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
other schemes , too , came into her head .
i will go to meryton , said she , as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .
kitty , run down and order the carriage .
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .
girls , can i do anything for you in meryton ?
oh !
here comes hill !
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding .
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .
poor lydias situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister , in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .
he now wished it more than ever .
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place .
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .
when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless , for , of course , they were to have a son .
the son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydias birth , had been certain that he would .
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents .
this was one point , with regard to lydia , at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement .
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands , lydias expenses had been very little within that sum .
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
his letter was soon dispatched ; for , though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother , but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her .
the good news spread quickly through the house , and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .
to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farmhouse .
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her ; and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband her misery was considered certain .
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
haye park might do , said she , if the gouldings could quit itor the great house at stoke , if the drawingroom were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for pulvis lodge , the attics are dreadful .
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained .
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her : mrs .
bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance .
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn .
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm .
it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion .
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it .
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all she could believe possible .
she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place .
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means .
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself , for , at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where , to every other objection , would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned .
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet .
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been most gladly and gratefully received !
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex ; but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .
to mr. bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
it was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .
and i think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my nieces .
it is mr. wickhams intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment , now quartered in the north .
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
he promises fairly ; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information ?
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us .
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south .
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .
yours ,etc .
 ,e .
gardiner .
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .
but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it .
lydias being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites .
she is so fond of mrs. forster , said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment .
his daughters request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative .
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north .
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
their sisters wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
the carriage was sent to meet them at  , and they were to return in it by dinnertime .
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets , and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
they came .
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them .
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand , with an affectionate smile , to wickham , who followed his lady ; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .
their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour .
there was no want of discourse .
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
only think of its being three months , she cried , since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
good gracious !
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again !
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was .
her father lifted up his eyes .
jane was distressed .
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , oh !
mamma , do the people hereabouts know i am married today ?
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the sideglass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like anything .
elizabeth could bear it no longer .
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mothers right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , ah !
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman .
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .
her ease and good spirits increased .
she longed to see mrs. phillips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called mrs .
wickham by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to show her ring , and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?
is not he a charming man ?
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .
i only hope they may have half my good luck .
they must all go to brighton .
that is the place to get husbands .
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .
very true ; and if i had my will , we should .
but my dear lydia , i dont at all like your going such a way off .
must it be so ?
oh , lord !
yes ;there is nothing in that .
i shall like it of all things .
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all .
i should like it beyond anything !
said her mother .
and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .
i thank you for my share of the favour , said elizabeth ; but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydias for him .
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth : lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe .
you were not by , when i told mamma and the others all about it .
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?
no really , replied elizabeth ; i think there cannot be too little said on the subject .
la !
you are so strange !
but i must tell you how it went off .
we were married , you know , at st .
clements , because wickhams lodgings were in that parish .
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock .
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !
i was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
if youll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
not one party , or scheme , or anything .
to be sure london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open .
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .
however , i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well .
mr .
darcy !
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .
oh , yes !
hewas to come there with wickham , you know .
but gracious me !
i quite forgot !
i ought not to have said a word about it .
i promised them so faithfully !
what will wickham say ?
it was to be such a secret !
if it was to be secret , said jane , say not another word on the subject .
you may depend upon my seeking no further .
oh !
certainly , said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; we will ask you no questions .
thank you , said lydia , for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry .
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
mr. darcy had been at her sisters wedding .
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
you may readily comprehend , she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .
pray write instantly , and let me understand itunless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .
not that i shall , though , she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ;till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could .
she was no sooner in possession of it than , hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
gracechurch street , sept .
6 .
my dear niece , i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .
dont think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side .
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done .
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .
mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been .
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; wickham repeatedly , lydia once .
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him .
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world .
his character was to speak for itself .
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself .
if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .
she then took a large house in edwardstreet , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town .
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction .
they were in  street .
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
she cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving wickham .
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been his design .
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone .
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
mr .
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country .
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
everything being settled between them , mr. darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former .
he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
on saturday he came again .
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
but our visitor was very obstinate .
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all .
he has been accused of many faults at different times , but this is the true one .
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .
it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickhams character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybodys reserve , can be answerable for the event .
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
i believe i have now told you every thing .
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by janes letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain .
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
mr .
darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him .
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .
i thought him very sly ;he hardly ever mentioned your name .
but slyness seems the fashion .
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p .
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .
but i must write no more .
the children have been wanting me this half hour .
yours , very sincerely , m .
gardiner .
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match , which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her .
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
brotherinlaw of wickham !
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
he had , to be sure , done much .
she was ashamed to think how much .
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing , to him .
oh !
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again .
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some ones approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?
said he , as he joined her .
you certainly do , she replied with a smile ; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .
i should be sorry indeed , if it were .
we were always good friends ; and now we are better .
true .
are the others coming out ?
i do not know .
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .
and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley .
she replied in the affirmative .
i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .
but of course she did not mention my name to you .
yes , she did .
and what did she say ?
that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid hadnot turned out well .
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented .
certainly , he replied , biting his lips .
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said : i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .
we passed each other several times .
i wonder what he can be doing there .
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , said elizabeth .
it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .
undoubtedly .
did you see him while you were at lambton ?
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had .
yes ; he introduced us to his sister .
and do you like her ?
very much .
i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .
i am very glad you liked her .
i hope she will turn out well .
i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age .
did you go by the village of kympton ?
i do not recollect that we did .
i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .
a most delightful place !
excellentparsonage house !
it would have suited me in every respect .
how should you have liked making sermons ?
exceedingly well .
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .
one ought not to repine ;but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !
the quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness !
but it was not to be .
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ?
i have heard from authority , which i thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .
you have .
yes , there was something in that ; i told you so from the first , you may remember .
i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .
you did !
and it was not wholly without foundation .
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it .
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling , for her sisters sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a goodhumoured smile : come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .
do not let us quarrel about the past .
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind .
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
the day of his and lydias departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
oh !
my dear lydia , she cried , when shall we meet again ?
oh , lord !
i dont know .
not these two or three years , perhaps .
write to me very often , my dear .
as often as i can .
but you know married women have never much time for writing .
my sisters may write to me .
they will have nothing else to do .
mr. wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes .
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
he is as fine a fellow , said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever i saw .
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
i am prodigiously proud of him .
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw .
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .
i often think , said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends .
one seems so forlorn without them .
this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , said elizabeth .
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .
it is no such thing .
lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off .
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation .
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .
she looked at jane , and smiled and shook her head by turns .
well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister , for mrs. phillips first brought her the news .
well , so much the better .
not that i care about it , though .
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again .
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .
and who knows what may happen ?
but that is nothing to us .
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ?
you may depend on it , replied the other , for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .
she was going to the butchers , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed .
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said : i saw you look at me today , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .
but dont imagine it was from any silly cause .
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at .
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .
not that i am afraid of myself , but i dread other peoples remarks .
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission , or being bold enough to come without it .
yet it is hard , she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !
i will leave him to himself .
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .
as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear , said mrs. bennet , you will wait on him of course .
no , no .
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fools errand again .
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .
tis an etiquette i despise , said he .
if he wants our society , let him seek it .
he knows where we live .
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again .
well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
but , however , that shant prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley , in consequence of it , before they did .
as the day of his arrival drew near , i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said jane to her sister .
it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much i suffer from what she says .
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !
i wish i could say anything to comfort you , replied elizabeth ; but it is wholly out of my power .
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .
mr. bingley arrived .
mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could .
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him , from her dressingroom window , enter the paddock and ride towards the house .
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the windowshe looked ,she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .
there is a gentleman with him , mamma , said kitty ; who can it be ?
some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know .
la !
replied kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .
mr. whatshisname .
that tall , proud man .
good gracious !
mr. darcy !
andso it does , i vow .
well , any friend of mr. bingleys will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him .
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingleys friend , without being heard by either of them .
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiners letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley .
her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .
but she would not be secure .
let me first see how he behaves , said she ; it will then be early enough for expectation .
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .
on the gentlemens appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance .
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .
he looked serious , as usual ; and , she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .
but , perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .
elizabeth , particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .
darcy , after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely anything .
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed .
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
could i expect it to be otherwise !
said she .
yet why did he come ?
she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
she inquired after his sister , but could do no more .
it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away , said mrs. bennet .
he readily agreed to it .
i began to be afraid you would never come back again .
people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .
miss lucas is married and settled .
and one of my own daughters .
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .
it was only said , lately , george wickham , esq .
to miss lydia bennet , without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
did you see it ?
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .
how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother , but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay i do not know how long .
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .
thank heaven !
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
a few weeks , he believed .
when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley , said her mother , i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennets manor .
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .
elizabeths misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
at that instant , she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .
the first wish of my heart , said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this !
let me never see either one or the other again !
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover .
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .
you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley , she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business .
they then went away .
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
mr. darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her .
why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she , did he come at all ?
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .
he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?
if he fears me , why come hither ?
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?
teasing , teasing , man !
i will think no more about him .
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which showed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .
now , said she , that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .
it will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .
yes , very indifferent indeed , said elizabeth , laughingly .
oh , jane , take care .
my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now ?
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hours visit , had revived .
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .
when they repaired to the diningroom , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .
he placed himself by her .
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of halflaughing alarm .
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , janes happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .
mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them .
he was on one side of her mother .
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did .
her mothers ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind ; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawingroom , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil .
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .
if he does not come to me , then , said she , i shall give him up for ever .
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair .
and on the gentlemens approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper : the men shant come and part us , i am determined .
we want none of them ; do we ?
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .
she followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !
a man who has once been refused !
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying : is your sister at pemberley still ?
yes , she will remain there till christmas .
and quite alone ?
have all her friends left her ?
mrs .
annesley is with her .
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks .
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .
when the teathings were removed , and the cardtables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
well girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , what say you to the day ?
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .
the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch .
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .
mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .
and what do you think she said besides ?
ah !
mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last .
she did indeed .
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously .
mrs. bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .
it has been a very agreeable day , said miss bennet to elizabeth .
the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .
i hope we may often meet again .
elizabeth smiled .
lizzy , you must not do so .
you must not suspect me .
it mortifies me .
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .
i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man .
you are very cruel , said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .
how hard it is in some cases to be believed !
and how impossible in others !
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ?
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
next time you call , said she , i hope we shall be more lucky .
he should be particularly happy at any time , etc .
etc .
 ;and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
can you come tomorrow ?
yes , he had no engagement at all for tomorrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
he came , and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed .
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out : my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .
he is comemr .
bingley is come .
he is , indeed .
make haste , make haste .
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .
never mind miss lizzys hair .
we will be down as soon as we can , said jane ; but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .
oh !
hang kitty !
what has she to do with it ?
come be quick , be quick !
where is your sash , my dear ?
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening .
after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , what is the matter mamma ?
what do you keep winking at me for ?
what am i to do ?
nothing child , nothing .
i did not wink at you .
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , come here , my love , i want to speak to you , took her out of the room .
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that she would not give in to it .
in a few minutes , mrs. bennet halfopened the door and called out : lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you .
elizabeth was forced to go .
we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; said her mother , as soon as she was in the hall .
kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressingroom .
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawingroom .
mrs. bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual .
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennets means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time .
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence .
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him .
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes .
but on returning to the drawingroom , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both , as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other , would have told it all .
their situation was awkward enough ; but hers she thought was still worse .
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
tis too much !
she added , by far too much .
i do not deserve it .
oh !
why is not everybody as happy ?
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said for the present .
i must go instantly to my mother ; she cried .
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself .
he is gone to my father already .
oh !
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !
how shall i bear so much happiness !
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .
and this , said she , is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection !
of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance !
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
where is your sister ?
said he hastily , as he opened the door .
with my mother up stairs .
she will be down in a moment , i dare say .
he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of janes perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and superexcellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .
mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter , and said : jane , i congratulate you .
you will be a very happy woman .
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
you are a good girl ; he replied , and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
your tempers are by no means unlike .
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .
i hope not so .
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me .
exceed their income !
my dear mr. bennet , cried his wife , what are you talking of ?
why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more .
then addressing her daughter , oh !
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !
i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night .
i knew how it would be .
i always said it must be so , at last .
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together .
oh !
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .
at that moment , she cared for no other .
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept .
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
he has made me so happy , said she , one evening , by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
i had not believed it possible .
i suspected as much , replied elizabeth .
but how did he account for it ?
it must have been his sisters doing .
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other .
that is the most unforgiving speech , said elizabeth , that i ever heard you utter .
good girl !
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard .
would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again !
he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty .
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !
cried jane .
oh !
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !
if i could but see you as happy !
if there were but such another man for you !
if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time .
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. phillips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .
one morning , about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered .
it was lady catherine de bourgh .
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .
mrs. bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , i hope you are well , miss bennet .
that lady , i suppose , is your mother .
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .
and that i suppose is one of your sisters .
yes , madam , said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to lady catherine .
she is my youngest girl but one .
my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family .
you have a very small park here , returned lady catherine after a short silence .
it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass .
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west .
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner , and then added : may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well .
yes , very well .
i saw them the night before last .
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything ; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth , miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .
go , my dear , cried her mother , and show her ladyship about the different walks .
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage .
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs .
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it .
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .
how could i ever think her like her nephew ?
said she , as she looked in her face .
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come .
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
indeed , you are mistaken , madam .
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .
miss bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago .
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy .
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you .
if you believed it impossible to be true , said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .
what could your ladyship propose by it ?
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .
your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , said elizabeth coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence .
if !
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?
i never heard that it was .
and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer .
this is not to be borne .
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .
it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .
you may have drawn him in .
if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it .
miss bennet , do you know who i am ?
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .
but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .
let me be rightly understood .
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .
no , never .
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .
now what have you to say ?
only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied : the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of hers .
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?
yes , and i had heard it before .
but what is that to me ?
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage .
its completion depended on others .
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ?
because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him .
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .
these are heavy misfortunes , replied elizabeth .
but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .
obstinate , headstrong girl !
i am ashamed of you !
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
is nothing due to me on that score ?
let us sit down .
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .
i have not been used to submit to any persons whims .
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .
that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me .
i will not be interrupted .
hear me in silence .
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the fathers , from respectable , honourable , and ancientthough untitledfamilies .
their fortune on both sides is splendid .
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .
is this to be endured !
but it must not , shall not be .
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up .
in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentlemans daughter ; so far we are equal .
true .
you are a gentlemans daughter .
but who was your mother ?
who are your uncles and aunts ?
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .
whatever my connections may be , said elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .
tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moments deliberation : i am not .
lady catherine seemed pleased .
and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?
i will make no promise of the kind .
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require .
and i certainly never shall give it .
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable ?
supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged .
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .
not so hasty , if you please .
i have by no means done .
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement .
i know it all ; that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business , at the expence of your father and uncles .
and is such a girl to be my nephews sister ?
is her husband , who is the son of his late fathers steward , to be his brother ?
heaven and earth !
ofwhat are you thinking ?
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ?
you can now have nothing further to say , she resentfully answered .
you have insulted me in every possible method .
i must beg to return to the house .
and she rose as she spoke .
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .
her ladyship was highly incensed .
you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
unfeeling , selfish girl !
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?
lady catherine , i have nothing further to say .
you know my sentiments .
you are then resolved to have him ?
i have said no such thing .
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .
it is well .
you refuse , then , to oblige me .
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .
neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .
and this is your real opinion !
this is your final resolve !
very well .
i shall now know how to act .
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
i came to try you .
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , i will carry my point .
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added , i take no leave of you , miss bennet .
i send no compliments to your mother .
you deserve no such attention .
i am most seriously displeased .
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
she did not choose it , said her daughter , she would go .
she is a very finelooking woman !
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ?
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she , for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .
lady catherine , it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
it was a rational scheme , to be sure !
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea .
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore for through their communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine , had only set that down as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
in revolving lady catherines expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain that , in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
in that case he would return no more .
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , she added , i shall know how to understand it .
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all .
the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennets curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject .
the next morning , as she was going downstairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
lizzy , said he , i was going to look for you ; come into my room .
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .
he then said , i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest .
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued : you look conscious .
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
this letter is from mr. collins .
from mr. collins !
and what can he have to say ?
something very much to the purpose of course .
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the goodnatured , gossiping lucases .
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .
what relates to yourself , is as follows : having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .
can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ?
this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire ,splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .
have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
but now it comes out : my motive for cautioning you is as follows .
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .
mr .
darcy , you see , is the man !
now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !
it is admirable !
elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
are you not diverted ?
oh !
yes .
pray read on .
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .
mr. collins moreover adds , i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
you ought certainly to forgive them , as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .
that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation , and his expectation of a young olivebranch .
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?
oh !
cried elizabeth , i am excessively diverted .
but it is so strange !
yesthat is what makes it amusing .
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collinss correspondence for any consideration .
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw .
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
did she call to refuse her consent ?
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcys indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit .
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .
it was agreed to .
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking ; mary could never spare time ; but the remaining five set off together .
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other .
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said : mr .
darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding yours .
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express .
i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted .
you must not blame my aunt .
lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .
if you will thank me , he replied , let it be for yourself alone .
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
but your family owe me nothing .
much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of you .
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
after a short pause , her companion added , you are too generous to trifle with me .
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .
my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .
elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .
they walked on , without knowing in what direction .
there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which , in her ladyships apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give .
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
it taught me to hope , said he , as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly .
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .
what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
for , though your accusations were illfounded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof .
it was unpardonable .
i cannot think of it without abhorrence .
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said elizabeth .
the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility .
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner .
those were your words .
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ;though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice .
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .
i can easily believe it .
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me .
oh !
do not repeat what i then said .
these recollections will not do at all .
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it .
darcy mentioned his letter .
did it , said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
i knew , said he , that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .
i hope you have destroyed the letter .
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .
the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .
when i wrote that letter , replied darcy , i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .
the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .
the adieu is charity itself .
but think no more of the letter .
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten .
you must learn some of my philosophy .
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
but with me , it is not so .
painful recollections will intrude which cannot , which ought not , to be repelled .
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper .
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child , i was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !
what do i not owe you !
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
by you , i was properly humbled .
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .
had you then persuaded yourself that i should ?
indeed i had .
what will you think of my vanity ?
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .
my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you .
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .
how you must have hated me after that evening ?
hate you !
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at pemberley .
you blamed me for coming ?
no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise .
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due .
my object then , replied darcy , was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you .
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know anything about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .
what could become of mr. bingley and jane !
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
i must ask whether you were surprised ?
said elizabeth .
not at all .
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen .
that is to say , you had given your permission .
i guessed as much .
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
on the evening before my going to london , said he , i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
his surprise was great .
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together .
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
did you speak from your own observation , said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?
from the former .
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here ; and i was convinced of her affection .
and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .
it did .
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy .
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .
he was angry .
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments .
he has heartily forgiven me now .
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin .
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
in the hall they parted .
my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary .
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
at night she opened her heart to jane .
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
you are joking , lizzy .
this cannot be !
engagedto mr. darcy !
no , no , you shall not deceive me .
i know it to be impossible .
this is a wretched beginning indeed !
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .
yet , indeed , i am in earnest .
i speak nothing but the truth .
he still loves me , and we are engaged .
jane looked at her doubtingly .
oh , lizzy !
it cannot be .
i know how much you dislike him .
you know nothing of the matter .
that is all to be forgot .
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself .
miss bennet still looked all amazement .
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
good heaven !
can it be really so !
yet now i must believe you , cried jane .
my dear , dear lizzy , i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain ?
forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?
there can be no doubt of that .
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
but are you pleased , jane ?
shall you like to have such a brother ?
very , very much .
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .
and do you really love him quite well enough ?
oh , lizzy !
do anything rather than marry without affection .
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?
oh , yes !
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all .
what do you mean ?
why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley .
i am afraid you will be angry .
my dearest sister , now be serious .
i want to talk very seriously .
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
will you tell me how long you have loved him ?
it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley .
another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish .
now i am quite happy , said she , for you will be as happy as myself .
i always had a value for him .
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingleys friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
i owe all that i know of it to another , not to you .
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage .
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .
good gracious !
cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
i had no notion but he would go ashooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
what shall we do with him ?
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingleys way .
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , mrs .
bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today ?
i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , said mrs. bennet , to walk to oakham mount this morning .
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view .
it may do very well for the others , replied mr. bingley ; but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .
wont it , kitty ?
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying : i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for janes sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience .
during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers .
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
she did not fear her fathers opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy ; and that it should be through her meansthat she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper , go to your father , he wants you in the library .
she was gone directly .
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
lizzy , said he , what are you doing ?
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?
have not you always hated him ?
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .
or , in other words , you are determined to have him .
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
but will they make you happy ?
have you any other objection , said elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?
none at all .
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him .
i do , i do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes , i love him .
indeed he has no improper pride .
he is perfectly amiable .
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .
lizzy , said her father , i have given him my consent .
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask .
i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .
but let me advise you to think better of it .
i know your disposition , lizzy .
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
you know not what you are about .
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her fathers incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .
well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking , i have no more to say .
if this be the case , he deserves you .
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to anyone less worthy .
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
he heard her with astonishment .
this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellows debts , and got him his commission !
so much the better .
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
had it been your uncles doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
i shall offer to pay him tomorrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collinss letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to gosaying , as she quitted the room , if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure .
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .
nor was it under many , many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
good gracious !
lord bless me !
only think !
dear me !
mr. darcy !
who would have thought it !
and is it really true ?
oh !
my sweetest lizzy !
how rich and how great you will be !
what pinmoney , what jewels , what carriages you will have !
janes is nothing to itnothing at all .
i am so pleasedso happy .
such a charming man !
sohandsome !
so tall !
oh ,my dear lizzy !
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .
i hope he will overlook it .
dear , dear lizzy .
a house in town !
every thing that is charming !
three daughters married !
ten thousand a year !
oh , lord !
what will become of me .
i shall go distracted .
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
my dearest child , she cried , i can think of nothing else !
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !
tis as good as a lord !
and a special licence .
you must and shall be married by a special licence .
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it tomorrow .
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations consent , there was still something to be wished for .
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly , said he .
wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes .
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
how could you begin ?
said she .
i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ?
i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
it is too long ago .
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun .
my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ?
for the liveliness of your mind , i did .
you may as well call it impertinence at once .
it was very little less .
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them .
had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
to be sure , you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield ?
dearest jane !
who could have done less for her ?
but make a virtue of it by all means .
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?
because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .
but i was embarrassed .
and so was i .
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .
a man who had felt less , might .
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you !
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .
too much , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ?
for i ought not to have mentioned the subject .
this will never do .
you need not distress yourself .
the moral will be perfectly fair .
lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts .
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours .
my aunts intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing .
lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?
my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made .
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her ?
i am more likely to want more time than courage , elizabeth .
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .
and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been overrated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiners long letter ; but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .
you supposed more than really existed .
but now suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose rein to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
your idea of the ponies is delightful .
we will go round the park every day .
i am the happiest creature in the world .
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me .
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .
yours , etc .
mr. darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style ; and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .
dear sir , i must trouble you once more for congratulations .
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .
console lady catherine as well as you can .
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .
he has more to give .
yours sincerely , etc .
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brothers in sending it .
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
he bore it , however , with admirable calmness .
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st .
jamess , with very decent composure .
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
mrs. phillipss vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater , tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. phillips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley , and talked of mrs. darcy , may be guessed .
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , wellinformed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ; and , removed from the influence of lydias example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .
from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennets being quite unable to sit alone .
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
the letter was to this effect : my dear lizzy , i wish you joy .
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .
yours , etc .
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; hers lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeths sake , he assisted him further in his profession .
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingleys good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .
pemberley was now georgianas home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended .
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
by elizabeths instructions , she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
but at length , by elizabeths persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
squire trelawney , dr .
livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , i take up my pen in the year of grace 17 and go back to the time when my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof .
i remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his seachest following behind him in a handbarrowa tall , strong , heavy , nutbrown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white .
i remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old seasong that he sang so often afterwards : fifteen men on the dead man's chest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars .
then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum .
this , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard .
this is a handy cove , says he at length ; and a pleasant sittyated grogshop .
much company , mate ?
my father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity .
well , then , said he , this is the berth for me .
here you , matey , he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; bring up alongside and help up my chest .
i'll stay here a bit , he continued .
i'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what i want , and that head up there for to watch ships off .
what you mought call me ?
you mought call me captain .
oh , i see what you're atthere ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold .
you can tell me when i've worked through that , says he , looking as fierce as a commander .
and indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke , he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast , but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike .
the man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the royal george , that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast , and hearing ours well spoken of , i suppose , and described as lonely , had chosen it from the others for his place of residence .
and that was all we could learn of our guest .
he was a very silent man by custom .
all day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope ; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong .
mostly he would not speak when spoken to , only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a foghorn ; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be .
every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road .
at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question , but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them .
when a seaman did put up at the admiral benbow as now and then some did , making by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour ; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present .
for me , at least , there was no secret about the matter , for i was , in a way , a sharer in his alarms .
he had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if i would only keep my weathereye open for a seafaring man with one leg and let him know the moment he appeared .
often enough when the first of the month came round and i applied to him for my wage , he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down , but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it , bring me my fourpenny piece , and repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg .
how that personage haunted my dreams , i need scarcely tell you .
on stormy nights , when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs , i would see him in a thousand forms , and with a thousand diabolical expressions .
now the leg would be cut off at the knee , now at the hip ; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg , and that in the middle of his body .
to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares .
and altogether i paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece , in the shape of these abominable fancies .
but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg , i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him .
there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry ; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked , old , wild seasongs , minding nobody ; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing .
often i have heard the house shaking with yohoho , and a bottle of rum , all the neighbours joining in for dear life , with the fear of death upon them , and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark .
for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known ; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round ; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question , or sometimes because none was put , and so he judged the company was not following his story .
nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed .
his stories were what frightened people worst of all .
dreadful stories they wereabout hanging , and walking the plank , and storms at sea , and the dry tortugas , and wild deeds and places on the spanish main .
by his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allowed upon the sea , and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described .
my father was always saying the inn would be ruined , for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down , and sent shivering to their beds ; but i really believe his presence did us good .
people were frightened at the time , but on looking back they rather liked it ; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life , and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him , calling him a true seadog and a real old salt and such like names , and saying there was the sort of man that made england terrible at sea .
in one way , indeed , he bade fair to ruin us , for he kept on staying week after week , and at last month after month , so that all the money had been long exhausted , and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more .
if ever he mentioned it , the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared , and stared my poor father out of the room .
i have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff , and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death .
all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker .
one of the cocks of his hat having fallen down , he let it hang from that day forth , though it was a great annoyance when it blew .
i remember the appearance of his coat , which he patched himself upstairs in his room , and which , before the end , was nothing but patches .
he never wrote or received a letter , and he never spoke with any but the neighbours , and with these , for the most part , only when drunk on rum .
the great seachest none of us had ever seen open .
he was only once crossed , and that was towards the end , when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off .
dr .
livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient , took a bit of dinner from my mother , and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet , for we had no stabling at the old benbow .
i followed him in , and i remember observing the contrast the neat , bright doctor , with his powder as white as snow and his bright , black eyes and pleasant manners , made with the coltish country folk , and above all , with that filthy , heavy , bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours , sitting , far gone in rum , with his arms on the table .
suddenly hethe captain , that isbegan to pipe up his eternal song : fifteen men on the dead man's chest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
drink and the devil had done for the rest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
at first i had supposed the dead man's chest to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room , and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the onelegged seafaring man .
but by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song ; it was new , that night , to nobody but dr .
livesey , and on him i observed it did not produce an agreeable effect , for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor , the gardener , on a new cure for the rheumatics .
in the meantime , the captain gradually brightened up at his own music , and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence .
the voices stopped at once , all but dr .
livesey's ; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two .
the captain glared at him for a while , flapped his hand again , glared still harder , and at last broke out with a villainous , low oath , silence , there , between decks !
were you addressing me , sir ?
says the doctor ; and when the ruffian had told him , with another oath , that this was so , i have only one thing to say to you , sir , replies the doctor , that if you keep on drinking rum , the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel !
the old fellow's fury was awful .
he sprang to his feet , drew and opened a sailor's claspknife , and balancing it open on the palm of his hand , threatened to pin the doctor to the wall .
the doctor never so much as moved .
he spoke to him as before , over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice , rather high , so that all the room might hear , but perfectly calm and steady : if you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket , i promise , upon my honour , you shall hang at the next assizes .
then followed a battle of looks between them , but the captain soon knuckled under , put up his weapon , and resumed his seat , grumbling like a beaten dog .
and now , sir , continued the doctor , since i now know there's such a fellow in my district , you may count i'll have an eye upon you day and night .
i'm not a doctor only ; i'm a magistrate ; and if i catch a breath of complaint against you , if it's only for a piece of incivility like tonight's , i'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this .
let that suffice .
soon after , dr .
livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away , but the captain held his peace that evening , and for many evenings to come .
it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain , though not , as you will see , of his affairs .
it was a bitter cold winter , with long , hard frosts and heavy gales ; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring .
he sank daily , and my mother and i had all the inn upon our hands , and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest .
it was one january morning , very earlya pinching , frosty morningthe cove all grey with hoarfrost , the ripple lapping softly on the stones , the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward .
the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach , his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat , his brass telescope under his arm , his hat tilted back upon his head .
i remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off , and the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation , as though his mind was still running upon dr .
livesey .
well , mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the breakfasttable against the captain's return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before .
he was a pale , tallowy creature , wanting two fingers of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter .
i had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and i remember this one puzzled me .
he was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too .
i asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as i was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near .
i paused where i was , with my napkin in my hand .
come here , sonny , says he .
come nearer here .
i took a step nearer .
is this here table for my mate bill ?
he asked with a kind of leer .
i told him i did not know his mate bill , and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain .
well , said he , my mate bill would be called the captain , as like as not .
he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , has my mate bill .
we'll put it , for argument like , that your captain has a cut on one cheekand we'll put it , if you like , that that cheek's the right one .
ah , well !
i told you .
now , is my mate bill in this here house ?
i told him he was out walking .
which way , sonny ?
which way is he gone ?
and when i had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return , and how soon , and answered a few other questions , ah , said he , this'll be as good as drink to my mate bill .
the expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant , and i had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken , even supposing he meant what he said .
but it was no affair of mine , i thought ; and besides , it was difficult to know what to do .
the stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door , peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse .
once i stepped out myself into the road , but he immediately called me back , and as i did not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change came over his tallowy face , and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump .
as soon as i was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me i was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me .
i have a son of my own , said he , as like you as two blocks , and he's all the pride of my 'art .
but the great thing for boys is discipline , sonnydiscipline .
now , if you had sailed along of bill , you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twicenot you .
that was never bill's way , nor the way of sich as sailed with him .
and here , sure enough , is my mate bill , with a spyglass under his arm , bless his old 'art , to be sure .
you and me'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we'll give bill a little surprisebless his 'art , i say again .
so saying , the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door .
i was very uneasy and alarmed , as you may fancy , and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself .
he cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat .
at last in strode the captain , slammed the door behind him , without looking to the right or left , and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him .
bill , said the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make bold and big .
the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us ; all the brown had gone out of his face , and even his nose was blue ; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost , or the evil one , or something worse , if anything can be ; and upon my word , i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick .
come , bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , bill , surely , said the stranger .
the captain made a sort of gasp .
black dog !
said he .
and who else ?
returned the other , getting more at his ease .
black dog as ever was , come for to see his old shipmate billy , at the admiral benbow inn .
ah , bill , bill , we have seen a sight of times , us two , since i lost them two talons , holding up his mutilated hand .
now , look here , said the captain ; you've run me down ; here i am ; well , then , speak up ; what is it ?
that's you , bill , returned black dog , you're in the right of it , billy .
i'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , as i've took such a liking to ; and we'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmates .
when i returned with the rum , they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfasttableblack dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , as i thought , on his retreat .
he bade me go and leave the door wide open .
none of your keyholes for me , sonny , he said ; and i left them together and retired into the bar .
for a long time , though i certainly did my best to listen , i could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voices began to grow higher , and i could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain .
no , no , no , no ; and an end of it !
he cried once .
and again , if it comes to swinging , swing all , say i .
then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noisesthe chair and table went over in a lump , a clash of steel followed , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant i saw black dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursuing , both with drawn cutlasses , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder .
just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of admiral benbow .
you may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day .
that blow was the last of the battle .
once out upon the road , black dog , in spite of his wound , showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute .
the captain , for his part , stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man .
then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house .
jim , says he , rum ; and as he spoke , he reeled a little , and caught himself with one hand against the wall .
are you hurt ?
cried i .
rum , he repeated .
i must get away from here .
rum !
rum !
i ran to fetch it , but i was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and i broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while i was still getting in my own way , i heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor .
at the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me .
between us we raised his head .
he was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour .
dear , deary me , cried my mother , what a disgrace upon the house !
and your poor father sick !
in the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his deathhurt in the scuffle with the stranger .
i got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron .
it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in , on his visit to my father .
oh , doctor , we cried , what shall we do ?
where is he wounded ?
wounded ?
a fiddlestick's end !
said the doctor .
no more wounded than you or i .
the man has had a stroke , as i warned him .
now , mrs. hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it .
for my part , i must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life ; jim , you get me a basin .
when i got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm .
it was tattooed in several places .
here's luck , a fair wind , and billy bones his fancy , were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from itdone , as i thought , with great spirit .
prophetic , said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger .
and now , master billy bones , if that be your name , we'll have a look at the colour of your blood .
jim , he said , are you afraid of blood ?
no , sir , said i .
well , then , said he , you hold the basin ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein .
a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
first he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved .
but suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , where's black dog ?
there is no black dog here , said the doctor , except what you have on your own back .
you have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as i told you ; and i have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave .
now , mr. bones that's not my name , he interrupted .
much i care , returned the doctor .
it's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and i call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what i have to say to you is this ; one glass of rum won't kill you , but if you take one you'll take another and another , and i stake my wig if you don't break off short , you'll diedo you understand that ?
die ,and go to your own place , like the man in the bible .
come , now , make an effort .
i'll help you to your bed for once .
between us , with much trouble , we managed to hoist him upstairs , and laid him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting .
now , mind you , said the doctor , i clear my consciencethe name of rum for you is death .
and with that he went off to see my father , taking me with him by the arm .
this is nothing , he said as soon as he had closed the door .
i have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he isthat is the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him .
about noon i stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks and medicines .
he was lying very much as we had left him , only a little higher , and he seemed both weak and excited .
jim , he said , you're the only one here that's worth anything , and you know i've been always good to you .
never a month but i've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
and now you see , mate , i'm pretty low , and deserted by all ; and jim , you'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , won't you , matey ?
the doctor i began .
but he broke in cursing the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily .
doctors is all swabs , he said ; and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?
i been in places hot as pitch , and mates dropping round with yellow jack , and the blessed land aheaving like the sea with earthquakeswhat to the doctor know of lands like that ?
andi lived on rum , i tell you .
it's been meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if i'm not to have my rum now i'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood'll be on you , jim , and that doctor swab ; and he ran on again for a while with curses .
look , jim , how my fingers fidges , he continued in the pleading tone .
i can't keep 'em still , not i .
i haven't had a drop this blessed day .
that doctor's a fool , i tell you .
if i don't have a dram o' rum , jim , i'll have the horrors ; i seen some on 'em already .
i seen old flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain as print , i seen him ; and if i get the horrors , i'm a man that has lived rough , and i'll raise cain .
your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn't hurt me .
i'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , jim .
he was growing more and more excited , and this alarmed me for my father , who was very low that day and needed quiet ; besides , i was reassured by the doctor's words , now quoted to me , and rather offended by the offer of a bribe .
i want none of your money , said i , but what you owe my father .
i'll get you one glass , and no more .
when i brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out .
aye , aye , said he , that's some better , sure enough .
and now , matey , did that doctor say how long i was to lie here in this old berth ?
a week at least , said i .
thunder !
he cried .
a week !
i can't do that ; they'd have the black spot on me by then .
the lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another's .
is that seamanly behaviour , now , i want to know ?
but i'm a saving soul .
i never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and i'll trick 'em again .
i'm not afraid on 'em .
i'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again .
as he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight .
his words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered .
he paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
that doctor's done me , he murmured .
my ears is singing .
lay me back .
before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent .
jim , he said at length , you saw that seafaring man today ?
black dog ?
i asked .
ah !
black dog , says he .
he's a bad un ; but there's worse that put him on .
now , if i can't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it's my old seachest they're after ; you get on a horseyou can , can't you ?
well , then , you get on a horse , and go towell , yes , i will !
tothat eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all handsmagistrates and sichand he'll lay 'em aboard at the admiral benbowall old flint's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that's left .
i was first mate , i was , old flint's first mate , and i'm the on'y one as knows the place .
he gave it me at savannah , when he lay adying , like as if i was to now , you see .
but you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me , or unless you see that black dog again or a seafaring man with one leg , jimhim above all .
but what is the black spot , captain ?
i asked .
that's a summons , mate .
i'll tell you if they get that .
but you keep your weathereye open , jim , and i'll share with you equals , upon my honour .
he wandered a little longer , his voice growing weaker ; but soon after i had given him his medicine , which he took like a child , with the remark , if ever a seaman wanted drugs , it's me , he fell at last into a heavy , swoonlike sleep , in which i left him .
what i should have done had all gone well i do not know .
probably i should have told the whole story to the doctor , for i was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me .
but as things fell out , my poor father died quite suddenly that evening , which put all other matters on one side .
our natural distress , the visits of the neighbours , the arranging of the funeral , and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that i had scarcely time to think of the captain , far less to be afraid of him .
he got downstairs next morning , to be sure , and had his meals as usual , though he ate little and had more , i am afraid , than his usual supply of rum , for he helped himself out of the bar , scowling and blowing through his nose , and no one dared to cross him .
on the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever ; and it was shocking , in that house of mourning , to hear him singing away at his ugly old seasong ; but weak as he was , we were all in the fear of death for him , and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father's death .
i have said the captain was weak , and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength .
he clambered up and down stairs , and went from the parlour to the bar and back again , and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea , holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain .
he never particularly addressed me , and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences ; but his temper was more flighty , and allowing for his bodily weakness , more violent than ever .
he had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table .
but with all that , he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering .
once , for instance , to our extreme wonder , he piped up to a different air , a kind of country lovesong that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea .
so things passed until , the day after the funeral , and about three o'clock of a bitter , foggy , frosty afternoon , i was standing at the door for a moment , full of sad thoughts about my father , when i saw someone drawing slowly near along the road .
he was plainly blind , for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose ; and he was hunched , as if with age or weakness , and wore a huge old tattered seacloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed .
i never saw in my life a more dreadfullooking figure .
he stopped a little from the inn , and raising his voice in an odd singsong , addressed the air in front of him , will any kind friend inform a poor blind man , who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country , englandand god bless king george !
whereor in what part of this country he may now be ?
you are at the admiral benbow , black hill cove , my good man , said i .
i hear a voice , said he , a young voice .
will you give me your hand , my kind young friend , and lead me in ?
i held out my hand , and the horrible , softspoken , eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise .
i was so much startled that i struggled to withdraw , but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm .
now , boy , he said , take me in to the captain .
sir , said i , upon my word i dare not .
oh , he sneered , that's it !
take me in straight or i'll break your arm .
and he gave it , as he spoke , a wrench that made me cry out .
sir , said i , it is for yourself i mean .
the captain is not what he used to be .
he sits with a drawn cutlass .
another gentleman come , now , march , interrupted he ; and i never heard a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly as that blind man's .
it cowed me more than the pain , and i began to obey him at once , walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer was sitting , dazed with rum .
the blind man clung close to me , holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry .
lead me straight up to him , and when i'm in view , cry out , 'here's a friend for you , bill .
'if you don't , i'll do this , and with that he gave me a twitch that i thought would have made me faint .
between this and that , i was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain , and as i opened the parlour door , cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice .
the poor captain raised his eyes , and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober .
the expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness .
he made a movement to rise , but i do not believe he had enough force left in his body .
now , bill , sit where you are , said the beggar .
if i can't see , i can hear a finger stirring .
business is business .
hold out your left hand .
boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right .
we both obeyed him to the letter , and i saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's , which closed upon it instantly .
and now that's done , said the blind man ; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skipped out of the parlour and into the road , where , as i still stood motionless , i could hear his stick go taptaptapping into the distance .
it was some time before either i or the captain seemed to gather our senses , but at length , and about at the same moment , i released his wrist , which i was still holding , and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm .
ten o'clock !
he cried .
six hours .
we'll do them yet , and he sprang to his feet .
even as he did so , he reeled , put his hand to his throat , stood swaying for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor .
i ran to him at once , calling to my mother .
but haste was all in vain .
the captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy .
it is a curious thing to understand , for i had certainly never liked the man , though of late i had begun to pity him , but as soon as i saw that he was dead , i burst into a flood of tears .
it was the second death i had known , and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart .
i lost no time , of course , in telling my mother all that i knew , and perhaps should have told her long before , and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position .
some of the man's moneyif he had anywas certainly due to us , but it was not likely that our captain's shipmates , above all the two specimens seen by me , black dog and the blind beggar , would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts .
the captain's order to mount at once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected , which was not to be thought of .
indeed , it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house ; the fall of coals in the kitchen grate , the very ticking of the clock , filled us with alarms .
the neighbourhood , to our ears , seemed haunted by approaching footsteps ; and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return , there were moments when , as the saying goes , i jumped in my skin for terror .
something must speedily be resolved upon , and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet .
no sooner said than done .
bareheaded as we were , we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog .
the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away , though out of view , on the other side of the next cove ; and what greatly encouraged me , it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned .
we were not many minutes on the road , though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken .
but there was no unusual soundnothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood .
it was already candlelight when we reached the hamlet , and i shall never forget how much i was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows ; but that , as it proved , was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter .
foryou would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselvesno soul would consent to return with us to the admiral benbow .
the more we told of our troubles , the moreman , woman , and childthey clung to the shelter of their houses .
the name of captain flint , though it was strange to me , was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror .
some of the men who had been to fieldwork on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered , besides , to have seen several strangers on the road , and taking them to be smugglers , to have bolted away ; and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called kitt's hole .
for that matter , anyone who was a comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death .
and the short and the long of the matter was , that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to dr .
livesey's , which lay in another direction , not one would help us to defend the inn .
they say cowardice is infectious ; but then argument is , on the other hand , a great emboldener ; and so when each had said his say , my mother made them a speech .
she would not , she declared , lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy ; if none of the rest of you dare , she said , jim and i dare .
back we will go , the way we came , and small thanks to you big , hulking , chickenhearted men .
we'll have that chest open , if we die for it .
and i'll thank you for that bag , mrs. crossley , to bring back our lawful money in .
of course i said i would go with my mother , and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness , but even then not a man would go along with us .
all they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked , and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return , while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance .
my heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture .
a full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog , and this increased our haste , for it was plain , before we came forth again , that all would be as bright as day , and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers .
we slipped along the hedges , noiseless and swift , nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors , till , to our relief , the door of the admiral benbow had closed behind us .
i slipped the bolt at once , and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark , alone in the house with the dead captain's body .
then my mother got a candle in the bar , and holding each other's hands , we advanced into the parlour .
he lay as we had left him , on his back , with his eyes open and one arm stretched out .
draw down the blind , jim , whispered my mother ; they might come and watch outside .
and now , said she when i had done so , we have to get the key off that ; and who's to touch it , i should like to know !
and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words .
i went down on my knees at once .
on the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper , blackened on the one side .
i could not doubt that this was the black spot ; and taking it up , i found written on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : you have till ten tonight .
he had till ten , mother , said i ; and just as i said it , our old clock began striking .
this sudden noise startled us shockingly ; but the news was good , for it was only six .
now , jim , she said , that key .
i felt in his pockets , one after another .
a few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and i began to despair .
perhaps it's round his neck , suggested my mother .
overcoming a strong repugnance , i tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which i cut with his own gully , we found the key .
at this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival .
it was like any other seaman's chest on the outside , the initial b burned on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long , rough usage .
give me the key , said my mother ; and though the lock was very stiff , she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling .
a strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior , but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brushed and folded .
they had never been worn , my mother said .
under that , the miscellany begana quadrant , a tin canikin , several sticks of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistols , a piece of bar silver , an old spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compasses mounted with brass , and five or six curious west indian shells .
i have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunted life .
in the meantime , we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets , and neither of these were in our way .
underneath there was an old boatcloak , whitened with seasalt on many a harbourbar .
my mother pulled it up with impatience , and there lay before us , the last things in the chest , a bundle tied up in oilcloth , and looking like papers , and a canvas bag that gave forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold .
i'll show these rogues that i'm an honest woman , said my mother .
i'll have my dues , and not a farthing over .
hold mrs. crossley's bag .
and she began to count over the amount of the captain's score from the sailor's bag into the one that i was holding .
it was a long , difficult business , for the coins were of all countries and sizesdoubloons , and louis d'ors , and guineas , and pieces of eight , and i know not what besides , all shaken together at random .
the guineas , too , were about the scarcest , and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count .
when we were about halfway through , i suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for i had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouththe taptapping of the blind man's stick upon the frozen road .
it drew nearer and nearer , while we sat holding our breath .
then it struck sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter ; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without .
at last the tapping recommenced , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard .
mother , said i , take the whole and let's be going , for i was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet's nest about our ears , though how thankful i was that i had bolted it , none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man .
but my mother , frightened as she was , would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less .
it was not yet seven , she said , by a long way ; she knew her rights and she would have them ; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill .
that was enough , and more than enough , for both of us .
i'll take what i have , she said , jumping to her feet .
and i'll take this to square the count , said i , picking up the oilskin packet .
next moment we were both groping downstairs , leaving the candle by the empty chest ; and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat .
we had not started a moment too soon .
the fog was rapidly dispersing ; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side ; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape .
far less than halfway to the hamlet , very little beyond the bottom of the hill , we must come forth into the moonlight .
nor was this all , for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears , and as we looked back in their direction , a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern .
my dear , said my mother suddenly , take the money and run on .
i am going to faint .
this was certainly the end for both of us , i thought .
how i cursed the cowardice of the neighbours ; how i blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed , for her past foolhardiness and present weakness !
we were just at the little bridge , by good fortune ; and i helped her , tottering as she was , to the edge of the bank , where , sure enough , she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder .
i do not know how i found the strength to do it at all , and i am afraid it was roughly done , but i managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch .
farther i could not move her , for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it .
so there we had to staymy mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn .
my curiosity , in a sense , was stronger than my fear , for i could not remain where i was , but crept back to the bank again , whence , sheltering my head behind a bush of broom , i might command the road before our door .
i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive , seven or eight of them , running hard , their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front .
three men ran together , hand in hand ; and i made out , even through the mist , that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar .
the next moment his voice showed me that i was right .
down with the door !
he cried .
aye , aye , sir !
answered two or three ; and a rush was made upon the admiral benbow , the lanternbearer following ; and then i could see them pause , and hear speeches passed in a lower key , as if they were surprised to find the door open .
but the pause was brief , for the blind man again issued his commands .
his voice sounded louder and higher , as if he were afire with eagerness and rage .
in , in , in !
he shouted , and cursed them for their delay .
four or five of them obeyed at once , two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar .
there was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , bill's dead .
but the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , he cried .
i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it .
promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him .
pew , he cried , they've been before us .
someone's turned the chest out alow and aloft .
is it there ?
roared pew .
the money's there .
the blind man cursed the money .
flint's fist , i mean , he cried .
we don't see it here nohow , returned the man .
here , you below there , is it on bill ?
cried the blind man again .
at that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain's body , came to the door of the inn .
bill's been overhauled a'ready , said he ; nothin' left .
it's these people of the innit's that boy .
i wish i had put his eyes out !
cried the blind man , pew .
there were no time agothey had the door bolted when i tried it .
scatter , lads , and find 'em .
sure enough , they left their glim here , said the fellow from the window .
scatter and find 'em !
rout the house out !
reiterated pew , striking with his stick upon the road .
then there followed a great todo through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks reechoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found .
and just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated .
i had thought it to be the blind man's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but i now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger .
there's dirk again , said one .
twice !
we'll have to budge , mates .
budge , you skulk !
cried pew .
dirk was a fool and a coward from the firstyou wouldn't mind him .
they must be close by ; they can't be far ; you have your hands on it .
scatter and look for them , dogs !
oh , shiver my soul , he cried , if i had eyes !
this appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but halfheartedly , i thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road .
you have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg !
you'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it's here , and you stand there skulking .
there wasn't one of you dared face bill , and i did ita blind man !
and i'm to lose my chance for you !
i'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when i might be rolling in a coach !
if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still .
hang it , pew , we've got the doubloons !
grumbled one .
they might have hid the blessed thing , said another .
take the georges , pew , and don't stand here squalling .
squalling was the word for it ; pew's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one .
these , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp .
this quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamletthe tramp of horses galloping .
almost at the same time a pistolshot , flash and report , came from the hedge side .
and that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but pew .
him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades .
finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , johnny , black dog , dirk , and other names , you won't leave old pew , matesnot old pew !
just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope .
at this pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled .
but he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses .
the rider tried to save him , but in vain .
down went pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by .
he fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more .
i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders .
they were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and i soon saw what they were .
one , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to dr .
livesey's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once .
some news of the lugger in kitt's hole had found its way to supervisor dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and i owed our preservation from death .
pew was dead , stone dead .
as for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money .
in the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to kitt's hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in .
he hailed her .
a voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm .
soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared .
mr. dance stood there , as he said , like a fish out of water , and all he could do was to dispatch a man to b to warn the cutter .
and that , said he , is just about as good as nothing .
they've got off clean , and there's an end .
only , he added , i'm glad i trod on master pew's corns , for by this time he had heard my story .
i went back with him to the admiral benbow , and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's moneybag and a little silver from the till , i could see at once that we were ruined .
mr. dance could make nothing of the scene .
they got the money , you say ?
well , then , hawkins , what in fortune were they after ?
more money , i suppose ?
no , sir ; not money , i think , replied i .
in fact , sir , i believe i have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , i should like to get it put in safety .
to be sure , boy ; quite right , said he .
i'll take it , if you like .
i thought perhaps dr .
livesey i began .
perfectly right , he interrupted very cheerily , perfectly righta gentleman and a magistrate .
and , now i come to think of it , i might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire .
master pew's dead , when all's done ; not that i regret it , but he's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his majesty's revenue , if make it out they can .
now , i'll tell you , hawkins , if you like , i'll take you along .
i thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were .
by the time i had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle .
dogger , said mr. dance , you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you .
as soon as i was mounted , holding on to dogger's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to dr .
livesey's house .
we rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr .
livesey's door .
the house was all dark to the front .
mr. dance told me to jump down and knock , and dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by .
the door was opened almost at once by the maid .
is dr .
livesey in ?
i asked .
no , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire .
so there we go , boys , said mr. dance .
this time , as the distance was short , i did not mount , but ran with dogger's stirrupleather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens .
here mr. dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house .
the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and dr .
livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire .
i had never seen the squire so near at hand .
he was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , roughandready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels .
his eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high .
come in , mr. dance , says he , very stately and condescending .
good evening , dance , says the doctor with a nod .
and good evening to you , friend jim .
what good wind brings you here ?
the supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest .
when they heard how my mother went back to the inn , dr .
livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried bravo !
and broke his long pipe against the grate .
long before it was done , mr. trelawney that , you will remember , was the squire's name had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own closecropped black poll .
at last mr. dance finished the story .
mr .
dance , said the squire , you are a very noble fellow .
and as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , i regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach .
this lad hawkins is a trump , i perceive .
hawkins , will you ring that bell ?
mr. dance must have some ale .
and so , jim , said the doctor , you have the thing that they were after , have you ?
here it is , sir , said i , and gave him the oilskin packet .
the doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat .
squire , said he , when dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his majesty's service ; but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , i propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup .
as you will , livesey , said the squire ; hawkins has earned better than cold pie .
so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and i made a hearty supper , for i was as hungry as a hawk , while mr. dance was further complimented and at last dismissed .
and now , squire , said the doctor .
and now , livesey , said the squire in the same breath .
one at a time , one at a time , laughed dr .
livesey .
you have heard of this flint , i suppose ?
heard of him !
cried the squire .
heard of him , you say !
he was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
blackbeard was a child to flint .
the spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , i tell you , sir , i was sometimes proud he was an englishman .
i've seen his topsails with these eyes , off trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rumpuncheon that i sailed with put backput back , sir , into port of spain .
well , i've heard of him myself , in england , said the doctor .
but the point is , had he money ?
money !
cried the squire .
have you heard the story ?
what were these villains after but money ?
what do they care for but money ?
for what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ?
that we shall soon know , replied the doctor .
but you are so confoundedly hotheaded and exclamatory that i cannot get a word in .
what i want to know is this : supposing that i have here in my pocket some clue to where flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ?
amount , sir !
cried the squire .
it will amount to this : if we have the clue you talk about , i fit out a ship in bristol dock , and take you and hawkins here along , and i'll have that treasure if i search a year .
very well , said the doctor .
now , then , if jim is agreeable , we'll open the packet ; and he laid it before him on the table .
the bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors .
it contained two thingsa book and a sealed paper .
first of all we'll try the book , observed the doctor .
the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for dr .
livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the sidetable , where i had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search .
on the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice .
one was the same as the tattoo mark , billy bones his fancy ; then there was mr .
w .
bones , mate , no more rum , off palm key he got itt , and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible .
i could not help wondering who it was that had got itt , and what itt was that he got .
a knife in his back as like as not .
not much instruction there , said dr .
livesey as he passed on .
the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries .
there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common accountbooks , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two .
on the 12th of june , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause .
in a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as offe caraccas , or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as 62o 17' 20 , 19o 2' 40 .
the record lasted over nearly twenty years , the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , bones , his pile .
i can't make head or tail of this , said dr .
livesey .
the thing is as clear as noonday , cried the squire .
this is the blackhearted hound's accountbook .
these crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered .
the sums are the scoundrel's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer .
'offe caraccas ,' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast .
god help the poor souls that manned hercoral long ago .
right !
said the doctor .
see what it is to be a traveller .
right !
and the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank .
there was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing french , english , and spanish moneys to a common value .
thrifty man !
cried the doctor .
he wasn't the one to be cheated .
and now , said the squire , for the other .
the paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that i had found in the captain's pocket .
the doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores .
it was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine landlocked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked the spyglass .
there were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red inktwo on the north part of the island , one in the southwestand beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain's tottery characters , these words : bulk of treasure here .
over on the back the same hand had written this further information : tall tree , spyglass shoulder , bearing a point to the n .
of n .
n .
e .
skeleton island e .
s .

and by e .
ten feet .
the bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it .
the arms are easy found , in the sandhill , n .
point of north inlet cape , bearing e .
and a quarter n .
j .
f .
that was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and dr .
livesey with delight .
livesey , said the squire , you will give up this wretched practice at once .
tomorrow i start for bristol .
in three weeks' timethree weeks !
twoweeksten dayswe'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in england .
hawkins shall come as cabinboy .
you'll make a famous cabinboy , hawkins .
you , livesey , are ship's doctor ; i am admiral .
we'll take redruth , joyce , and hunter .
we'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after .
trelawney , said the doctor , i'll go with you ; and i'll go bail for it , so will jim , and be a credit to the undertaking .
there's only one man i'm afraid of .
and who's that ?
cried the squire .
name the dog , sir !
you , replied the doctor ; for you cannot hold your tongue .
we are not the only men who know of this paper .
these fellows who attacked the inn tonightbold , desperate blades , for sureand the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , i dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they'll get that money .
we must none of us go alone till we get to sea .
jim and i shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you'll take joyce and hunter when you ride to bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found .
livesey , returned the squire , you are always in the right of it .
i'll be as silent as the grave .
it was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plansnot even dr .
livesey's , of keeping me beside himcould be carried out as we intended .
the doctor had to go to london for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at bristol ; and i lived on at the hall under the charge of old redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of seadreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures .
i brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which i well remembered .
sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room , i approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; i explored every acre of its surface ; i climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the spyglass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects .
sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures .
so the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to dr .
livesey , with this addition , to be opened , in the case of his absence , by tom redruth or young hawkins .
obeying this order , we found , or rather i foundfor the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but printthe following important news : old anchor inn , bristol , march 1 , 17 dear liveseyas i do not know whether you are at the hall or still in london , i send this in double to both places .
the ship is bought and fitted .
she lies at anchor , ready for sea .
you never imagined a sweeter schoonera child might sail hertwo hundred tons ; name , hispaniola .
i got her through my old friend , blandly , who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump .
the admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest , and so , i may say , did everyone in bristol , as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed fortreasure , i mean .
redruth , said i , interrupting the letter , dr .
livesey will not like that .
the squire has been talking , after all .
well , who's a better right ?
growled the gamekeeper .
a pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for dr .
livesey , i should think .
at that i gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on : blandly himself found the hispaniola , and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle .
there is a class of men in bristol monstrously prejudiced against blandly .
they go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the hispaniola belonged to him , and that he sold it me absurdly highthe most transparent calumnies .
none of them dare , however , to deny the merits of the ship .
so far there was not a hitch .
the workpeople , to be sureriggers and what notwere most annoyingly slow ; but time cured that .
it was the crew that troubled me .
i wished a round score of menin case of natives , buccaneers , or the odious frenchand i had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that i required .
i was standing on the dock , when , by the merest accident , i fell in talk with him .
i found he was an old sailor , kept a publichouse , knew all the seafaring men in bristol , had lost his health ashore , and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again .
he had hobbled down there that morning , he said , to get a smell of the salt .
i was monstrously touchedso would you have beenand , out of pure pity , i engaged him on the spot to be ship's cook .
long john silver , he is called , and has lost a leg ; but that i regarded as a recommendation , since he lost it in his country's service , under the immortal hawke .
he has no pension , livesey .
imagine the abominable age we live in !
well , sir , i thought i had only found a cook , but it was a crew i had discovered .
between silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginablenot pretty to look at , but fellows , by their faces , of the most indomitable spirit .
i declare we could fight a frigate .
long john even got rid of two out of the six or seven i had already engaged .
he showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of freshwater swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance .
i am in the most magnificent health and spirits , eating like a bull , sleeping like a tree , yet i shall not enjoy a moment till i hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan .
seaward , ho !
hang the treasure !
it's the glory of the sea that has turned my head .
so now , livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me .
let young hawkins go at once to see his mother , with redruth for a guard ; and then both come full speed to bristol .
john trelawney postscripti did not tell you that blandly , who , by the way , is to send a consort after us if we don't turn up by the end of august , had found an admirable fellow for sailing mastera stiff man , which i regret , but in all other respects a treasure .
long john silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate , a man named arrow .
i have a boatswain who pipes , livesey ; so things shall go mano'war fashion on board the good ship hispaniola .
i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of substance ; i know of my own knowledge that he has a banker's account , which has never been overdrawn .
he leaves his wife to manage the inn ; and as she is a woman of colour , a pair of old bachelors like you and i may be excused for guessing that it is the wife , quite as much as the health , that sends him back to roving .
j .
t .

s .
hawkinsmay stay one night with his mother .
j .
t .
you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me .
i was half beside myself with glee ; and if ever i despised a man , it was old tom redruth , who could do nothing but grumble and lament .
any of the undergamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him ; but such was not the squire's pleasure , and the squire's pleasure was like law among them all .
nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble .
the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow , and there i found my mother in good health and spirits .
the captain , who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort , was gone where the wicked cease from troubling .
the squire had had everything repaired , and the public rooms and the sign repainted , and had added some furnitureabove all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar .
he had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while i was gone .
it was on seeing that boy that i understood , for the first time , my situation .
i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me , not at all of the home that i was leaving ; and now , at sight of this clumsy stranger , who was to stay here in my place beside my mother , i had my first attack of tears .
i am afraid i led that boy a dog's life , for as he was new to the work , i had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down , and i was not slow to profit by them .
the night passed , and the next day , after dinner , redruth and i were afoot again and on the road .
i said goodbye to mother and the cove where i had lived since i was born , and the dear old admiral benbowsince he was repainted , no longer quite so dear .
one of my last thoughts was of the captain , who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat , his sabrecut cheek , and his old brass telescope .
next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight .
the mail picked us up about dusk at the royal george on the heath .
i was wedged in between redruth and a stout old gentleman , and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air , i must have dozed a great deal from the very first , and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage , for when i was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs , and i opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time .
where are we ?
i asked .
bristol , said tom .
get down .
mr. trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner .
thither we had now to walk , and our way , to my great delight , lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations .
in one , sailors were singing at their work , in another there were men aloft , high over my head , hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's .
though i had lived by the shore all my life , i seemed never to have been near the sea till then .
the smell of tar and salt was something new .
i saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean .
i saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy seawalk ; and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could not have been more delighted .
and i was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pigtailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !
while i was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met squire trelawney , all dressed out like a seaofficer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk .
here you are , he cried , and the doctor came last night from london .
bravo !
the ship's company complete !
oh , sir , cried i , when do we sail ?
sail !
says he .
we sail tomorrow !
when i had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to john silver , at the sign of the spyglass , and told me i should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign .
i set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until i found the tavern in question .
it was a bright enough little place of entertainment .
the sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded .
there was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke .
the customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that i hung at the door , almost afraid to enter .
as i was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance i was sure he must be long john .
his left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird .
he was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a hamplain and pale , but intelligent and smiling .
indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests .
now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of long john in squire trelawney's letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very onelegged sailor whom i had watched for so long at the old benbow .
but one look at the man before me was enough .
i had seen the captain , and black dog , and the blind man , pew , and i thought i knew what a buccaneer was likea very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasanttempered landlord .
i plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer .
mr .
silver , sir ?
i asked , holding out the note .
yes , my lad , said he ; such is my name , to be sure .
and who may you be ?
and then as he saw the squire's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start .
oh !
said he , quite loud , and offering his hand .
i see .
you are our new cabinboy ; pleased i am to see you .
and he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
it was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment .
but his hurry had attracted my notice , and i recognized him at glance .
it was the tallowfaced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the admiral benbow .
oh , i cried , stop him !
it's black dog !
i don't care two coppers who he is , cried silver .
but he hasn't paid his score .
harry , run and catch him .
one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score , cried silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , who did you say he was ?
he asked .
black what ?
dog , sir , said i .
has mr. trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?
he was one of them .
so ?
cried silver .
in my house !
ben , run and help harry .
one of those swabs , was he ?
was that you drinking with him , morgan ?
step up here .
the man whom he called morganan old , greyhaired , mahoganyfaced sailorcame forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid .
now , morgan , said long john very sternly , you never clapped your eyes on that blackblack dog before , did you , now ?
not i , sir , said morgan with a salute .
you didn't know his name , did you ?
no , sir .
by the powers , tom morgan , it's as good for you !
exclaimed the landlord .
if you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that .
and what was he saying to you ?
i don't rightly know , sir , answered morgan .
do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed deadeye ?
cried long john .
don't rightly know , don't you !
perhaps you don't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?
come , now , what was he jawingv'yages , cap'ns , ships ?
pipe up !
what was it ?
we was atalkin' of keelhauling , answered morgan .
keelhauling , was you ?
and a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that .
get back to your place for a lubber , tom .
and then , as morgan rolled back to his seat , silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as i thought , he's quite an honest man , tom morgan , on'y stupid .
and now , he ran on again , aloud , let's seeblack dog ?
no , i don't know the name , not i .
yet i kind of think i'veyes , i've seen the swab .
he used to come here with a blind beggar , he used .
that he did , you may be sure , said i .
i knew that blind man too .
his name was pew .
it was !
cried silver , now quite excited .
pew !
that were his name for certain .
ah , he looked a shark , he did !
if we run down this black dog , now , there'll be news for cap'n trelawney !
ben's a good runner ; few seamen run better than ben .
he should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !
he talked o' keelhauling , did he ?
i'll keelhaul him !
all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge or a bow street runner .
my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding black dog at the spyglass , and i watched the cook narrowly .
but he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , i would have gone bail for the innocence of long john silver .
see here , now , hawkins , said he , here's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ain't it ?
there's cap'n trelawneywhat's he to think ?
here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum !
here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights !
now , hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n .
you're a lad , you are , but you're as smart as paint .
i see that when you first come in .
now , here it is : what could i do , with this old timber i hobble on ?
when i was an a b master mariner i'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , i would ; but now and then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something .
the score !
he burst out .
three goes o' rum !
why , shiver my timbers , if i hadn't forgotten my score !
and falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks .
i could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again .
why , what a precious old seacalf i am !
he said at last , wiping his cheeks .
you and me should get on well , hawkins , for i'll take my davy i should be rated ship's boy .
but come now , stand by to go about .
this won't do .
dooty is dooty , messmates .
i'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to cap'n trelawney , and report this here affair .
for mind you , it's serious , young hawkins ; and neither you nor me's come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit .
nor you neither , says you ; not smartnone of the pair of us smart .
but dash my buttons !
that was a good un about my score .
and he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though i did not see the joke as he did , i was again obliged to join him in his mirth .
on our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forwardhow one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for seaand every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had learned it perfectly .
i began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates .
when we got to the inn , the squire and dr .
livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection .
long john told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth .
that was how it were , now , weren't it , hawkins ?
he would say , now and again , and i could always bear him entirely out .
the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , long john took up his crutch and departed .
all hands aboard by four this afternoon , shouted the squire after him .
aye , aye , sir , cried the cook , in the passage .
well , squire , said dr .
livesey , i don't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but i will say this , john silver suits me .
the man's a perfect trump , declared the squire .
and now , added the doctor , jim may come on board with us , may he not ?
to be sure he may , says squire .
take your hat , hawkins , and we'll see the ship .
sthe hispaniola lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us .
at last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , mr. arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint .
he and the squire were very thick and friendly , but i soon observed that things were not the same between mr. trelawney and the captain .
this last was a sharplooking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us .
captain smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , said he .
i am always at the captain's orders .
show him in , said the squire .
the captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him .
well , captain smollett , what have you to say ?
all well , i hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ?
well , sir , said the captain , better speak plain , i believe , even at the risk of offence .
i don't like this cruise ; i don't like the men ; and i don't like my officer .
that's short and sweet .
perhaps , sir , you don't like the ship ?
inquired the squire , very angry , as i could see .
i can't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , said the captain .
she seems a clever craft ; more i can't say .
possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ?
says the squire .
but here dr .
livesey cut in .
stay a bit , said he , stay a bit .
no use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
the captain has said too much or he has said too little , and i'm bound to say that i require an explanation of his words .
you don't , you say , like this cruise .
now , why ?
i was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , said the captain .
so far so good .
but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i do .
i don't call that fair , now , do you ?
no , said dr .
livesey , i don't .
next , said the captain , i learn we are going after treasurehear it from my own hands , mind you .
now , treasure is ticklish work ; i don't like treasure voyages on any account , and i don't like them , above all , when they are secret and when begging your pardon , mr. trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot .
silver's parrot ?
asked the squire .
it's a way of speaking , said the captain .
blabbed , i mean .
it's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but i'll tell you my way of itlife or death , and a close run .
that is all clear , and , i dare say , true enough , replied dr .
livesey .
we take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us .
next , you say you don't like the crew .
are they not good seamen ?
i don't like them , sir , returned captain smollett .
and i think i should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that .
perhaps you should , replied the doctor .
my friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional .
and you don't like mr. arrow ?
i don't , sir .
i believe he's a good seaman , but he's too free with the crew to be a good officer .
a mate should keep himself to himselfshouldn't drink with the men before the mast !
do you mean he drinks ?
cried the squire .
no , sir , replied the captain , only that he's too familiar .
well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ?
asked the doctor .
tell us what you want .
well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ?
like iron , answered the squire .
very good , said the captain .
then , as you've heard me very patiently , saying things that i could not prove , hear me a few words more .
they are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?
firstpoint .
then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward .
why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
secondpoint .
any more ?
asked mr. trelawney .
one more , said the captain .
there's been too much blabbing already .
far too much , agreed the doctor .
i'll tell you what i've heard myself , continued captain smollett : that you have a map of an island , that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies and then he named the latitude and longitude exactly .
i never told that , cried the squire , to a soul !
the hands know it , sir , returned the captain .
livesey , that must have been you or hawkins , cried the squire .
it doesn't much matter who it was , replied the doctor .
and i could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr. trelawney's protestations .
neither did i , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case i believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island .
well , gentlemen , continued the captain , i don't know who has this map ; but i make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and mr. arrow .
otherwise i would ask you to let me resign .
i see , said the doctor .
you wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board .
in other words , you fear a mutiny .
sir , said captain smollett , with no intention to take offence , i deny your right to put words into my mouth .
no captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that .
as for mr. arrow , i believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what i know .
but i am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her .
i see things going , as i think , not quite right .
and i ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth .
and that's all .
captain smollett , began the doctor with a smile , did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?
you'll excuse me , i dare say , but you remind me of that fable .
when you came in here , i'll stake my wig , you meant more than this .
doctor , said the captain , you are smart .
when i came in here i meant to get discharged .
i had no thought that mr. trelawney would hear a word .
no more i would , cried the squire .
had livesey not been here i should have seen you to the deuce .
as it is , i have heard you .
i will do as you desire , but i think the worse of you .
that's as you please , sir , said the captain .
you'll find i do my duty .
and with that he took his leave .
trelawney , said the doctor , contrary to all my notions , i believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with youthat man and john silver .
silver , if you like , cried the squire ; but as for that intolerable humbug , i declare i think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright unenglish .
well , says the doctor , we shall see .
when we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yohoing at their work , while the captain and mr. arrow stood by superintending .
the new arrangement was quite to my liking .
the whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the afterpart of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
it had been originally meant that the captain , mr. arrow , hunter , joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths .
now redruth and i were to get two of them and mr. arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a roundhouse .
very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement .
even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion .
we were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and long john along with them , came off in a shoreboat .
the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , so ho , mates !
says he .
what's this ?
we're achanging of the powder , jack , answers one .
why , by the powers , cried long john , if we do , we'll miss the morning tide !
my orders !
said the captain shortly .
you may go below , my man .
hands will want supper .
aye , aye , sir , answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley .
that's a good man , captain , said the doctor .
very likely , sir , replied captain smollett .
easy with that , meneasy , he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , here you , ship's boy , he cried , out o' that !
off with you to the cook and get some work .
and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , i'll have no favourites on my ship .
i assure you i was quite of the squire's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply .
all that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire's friends , mr. blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return .
we never had a night at the admiral benbow when i had half the work ; and i was dogtired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstanbars .
i might have been twice as weary , yet i would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to methe brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns .
now , barbecue , tip us a stave , cried one voice .
the old one , cried another .
aye , aye , mates , said long john , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words i knew so well : fifteen men on the dead man's chest and then the whole crew bore chorus : yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
and at the third ho !
drove the bars before them with a will .
even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old admiral benbow in a second , and i seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus .
but soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before i could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyage to the isle of treasure .
i am not going to relate that voyage in detail .
it was fairly prosperous .
the ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business .
but before we came the length of treasure island , two or three things had happened which require to be known .
mr. arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared .
he had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him .
but that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness .
time after time he was ordered below in disgrace .
sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
in the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink .
that was the ship's mystery .
watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water .
he was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more .
overboard !
said the captain .
well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons .
but there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men .
the boatswain , job anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate .
mr. trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather .
and the coxswain , israel hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything .
he was a great confidant of long john silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook , barbecue , as the men called him .
aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible .
it was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore .
still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck .
he had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaceslong john's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk .
yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced .
he's no common man , barbecue , said the coxswain to me .
he had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and bravea lion's nothing alongside of long john !
i seen him grapple four and knock their heads togetherhim unarmed .
all the crew respected and even obeyed him .
he had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service .
to me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner .
come away , hawkins , he would say ; come and have a yarn with john .
nobody more welcome than yourself , my son .
sit you down and hear the news .
here's cap'n flinti calls my parrot cap'n flint , after the famous buccaneerhere's cap'n flint predicting success to our v'yage .
wasn't you , cap'n ?
and the parrot would say , with great rapidity , pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till john threw his handkerchief over the cage .
now , that bird , he would say , is , maybe , two hundred years old , hawkinsthey live forever mostly ; and if anybody's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself .
she's sailed with england , the great cap'n england , the pirate .
she's been at madagascar , and at malabar , and surinam , and providence , and portobello .
she was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships .
it's there she learned 'pieces of eight ,' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , hawkins !
she was at the boarding of the viceroy of the indies out of goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby .
but you smelt powderdidn't you , cap'n ?
stand by to go about , the parrot would scream .
ah , she's a handsome craft , she is , the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness .
there , john would add , you can't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad .
here's this poor old innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that .
she would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain .
and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men .
in the meantime , the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another .
the squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain .
the captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted .
he owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well .
as for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her .
she'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir .
but , he would add , all i say is , we're not home again , and i don't like the cruise .
the squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air .
a trifle more of that man , he would say , and i shall explode .
we had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the hispaniola .
every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since noah put to sea .
double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy .
never knew good come of it yet , the captain said to dr .
livesey .
spoil forecastle hands , make devils .
that's my belief .
but good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery .
this was how it came about .
we had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were afteri am not allowed to be more plainand now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
it was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the treasure island .
we were heading s .
s .
w .
and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
the hispaniola rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray .
all was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and i was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that i should like an apple .
i ran on deck .
the watch was all forward looking out for the island .
the man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship .
in i got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , i had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by .
the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak .
it was silver's voice , and before i had heard a dozen words , i would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone .
no , not i , said silver .
flint was cap'n ; i was quartermaster , along of my timber leg .
the same broadside i lost my leg , old pew lost his deadlights .
it was a master surgeon , him that ampytated meout of college and alllatin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sundried like the rest , at corso castle .
that was roberts' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their shipsroyal fortune and so on .
now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , i says .
so it was with the cassandra , as brought us all safe home from malabar , after england took the viceroy of the indies ; so it was with the old walrus , flint's old ship , as i've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold .
ah !
cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration .
he was the flower of the flock , was flint !
davis was a man too , by all accounts , said silver .
i never sailed along of him ; first with england , then with flint , that's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking .
i laid by nine hundred safe , from england , and two thousand after flint .
that ain't bad for a man before the mastall safe in bank .
'tain't earning now , it's saving does it , you may lay to that .
where's all england's men now ?
i dunno .
where's flint's ?
why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duffbeen begging before that , some on 'em .
old pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in parliament .
where is he now ?
well , he's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !
he begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers !
well , it ain't much use , after all , said the young seaman .
'tain't much use for fools , you may lay to itthat , nor nothing , cried silver .
but now , you look here : you're young , you are , but you're as smart as paint .
i see that when i set my eyes on you , and i'll talk to you like a man .
you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
i think , if i had been able , that i would have killed him through the barrel .
meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard .
here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
they lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fightingcocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets .
now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts .
but that's not the course i lay .
i puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion .
i'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , i set up gentleman in earnest .
time enough too , says you .
ah , but i've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o' nothing heart desires , and slep' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea .
and how did i begin ?
before the mast , like you !
well , said the other , but all the other money's gone now , ain't it ?
you daren't show face in bristol after this .
why , where might you suppose it was ?
asked silver derisively .
at bristol , in banks and places , answered his companion .
it were , said the cook ; it were when we weighed anchor .
but my old missis has it all by now .
and the spyglass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl's off to meet me .
i would tell you where , for i trust you , but it'd make jealousy among the mates .
and can you trust your missis ?
asked the other .
gentlemen of fortune , returned the cook , usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it .
but i have a way with me , i have .
when a mate brings a slip on his cableone as knows me , i meanit won't be in the same world with old john .
there was some that was feared of pew , and some that was feared of flint ; but flint his own self was feared of me .
feared he was , and proud .
they was the roughest crew afloat , was flint's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them .
well now , i tell you , i'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy i keep company , but when i was quartermaster , lambs wasn't the word for flint's old buccaneers .
ah , you may be sure of yourself in old john's ship .
well , i tell you now , replied the lad , i didn't half a quarter like the job till i had this talk with you , john ; but there's my hand on it now .
and a brave lad you were , and smart too , answered silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune i never clapped my eyes on .
by this time i had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
by a gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that i had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest handsperhaps of the last one left aboard .
but on this point i was soon to be relieved , for silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party .
dick's square , said silver .
oh , i know'd dick was square , returned the voice of the coxswain , israel hands .
he's no fool , is dick .
and he turned his quid and spat .
but look here , he went on , here's what i want to know , barbecue : how long are we agoing to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?
i've had a'most enough o' cap'n smollett ; he's hazed me long enough , by thunder !
i want to go into that cabin , i do .
i want their pickles and wines , and that .
israel , said silver , your head ain't much account , nor ever was .
but you're able to hear , i reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough .
now , here's what i say : you'll berth forward , and you'll live hard , and you'll speak soft , and you'll keep sober till i give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son .
well , i don't say no , do i ?
growled the coxswain .
what i say is , when ?
that's what i say .
when !
by the powers !
cried silver .
well now , if you want to know , i'll tell you when .
the last moment i can manage , and that's when .
here's a firstrate seaman , cap'n smollett , sails the blessed ship for us .
here's this squire and doctor with a map and suchi don't know where it is , do i ?
no more do you , says you .
well then , i mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers .
then we'll see .
if i was sure of you all , sons of double dutchmen , i'd have cap'n smollett navigate us halfway back again before i struck .
why , we're all seamen aboard here , i should think , said the lad dick .
we're all forecastle hands , you mean , snapped silver .
we can steer a course , but who's to set one ?
that's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last .
if i had my way , i'd have cap'n smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day .
but i know the sort you are .
i'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon's the blunt's on board , and a pity it is .
but you're never happy till you're drunk .
split my sides , i've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you !
easy all , long john , cried israel .
who's acrossin' of you ?
why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have i seen laid aboard ?
and how many brisk lads drying in the sun at execution dock ?
cried silver .
and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
you hear me ?
i seen a thing or two at sea , i have .
if you would on'y lay your course , and a p'int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would .
but not you !
i know you .
you'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang .
everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , john ; but there's others as could hand and steer as well as you , said israel .
they liked a bit o' fun , they did .
they wasn't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one .
so ?
says silver .
well , and where are they now ?
pew was that sort , and he died a beggarman .
flint was , and he died of rum at savannah .
ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !
on'y , where are they ?
but , asked dick , when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ?
there's the man for me !
cried the cook admiringly .
that's what i call business .
well , what would you think ?
put 'em ashore like maroons ?
that would have been england's way .
or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
that would have been flint's , or billy bones's .
billy was the man for that , said israel .
'dead men don't bite ,' says he .
well , he's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was billy .
right you are , said silver ; rough and ready .
but mark you here , i'm an easy mani'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it's serious .
dooty is dooty , mates .
i give my votedeath .
when i'm in parlyment and riding in my coach , i don't want none of these sealawyers in the cabin acoming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers .
wait is what i say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip !
john , cries the coxswain , you're a man !
you'll say so , israel when you see , said silver .
only one thing i claimi claim trelawney .
i'll wring his calf's head off his body with these hands , dick !
he added , breaking off .
you just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like .
you may fancy the terror i was in !
i should have leaped out and run for it if i had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me .
i heard dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of hands exclaimed , oh , stow that !
don't you get sucking of that bilge , john .
let's have a go of the rum .
dick , said silver , i trust you .
i've a gauge on the keg , mind .
there's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up .
terrified as i was , i could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how mr. arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him .
dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence israel spoke straight on in the cook's ear .
it was but a word or two that i could catch , and yet i gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : not another man of them'll jine .
hence there were still faithful men on board .
when dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drankone to luck , another with a here's to old flint , and silver himself saying , in a kind of song , here's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff .
just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , i found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzentop and shining white on the luff of the foresail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , land ho !
there was a great rush of feet across the deck .
i could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , i dived behind the foresail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join hunter and dr .
livesey in the rush for the weather bow .
there all hands were already congregated .
a belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
away to the southwest of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog .
all three seemed sharp and conical in figure .
so much i saw , almost in a dream , for i had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before .
and then i heard the voice of captain smollett issuing orders .
the hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east .
and now , men , said the captain , when all was sheeted home , has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ?
i have , sir , said silver .
i've watered there with a trader i was cook in .
the anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , i fancy ?
asked the captain .
yes , sir ; skeleton island they calls it .
it were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it .
that hill to the nor'ard they calls the foremast hill ; there are three hills in a row running south'ardfore , main , and mizzen , sir .
but the mainthat's the big un , with the cloud on itthey usually calls the spyglass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon .
i have a chart here , says captain smollett .
see if that's the place .
long john's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment .
this was not the map we found in billy bones's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all thingsnames and heights and soundingswith the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes .
sharp as must have been his annoyance , silver had the strength of mind to hide it .
yes , sir , said he , this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out .
who might have done that , i wonder ?
the pirates were too ignorant , i reckon .
aye , here it is : 'capt .
kidd's anchorage'just the name my shipmate called it .
there's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor'ard up the west coast .
right you was , sir , says he , to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island .
leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ain't no better place for that in these waters .
thank you , my man , says captain smollett .
i'll ask you later on to give us a help .
you may go .
i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge of the island , and i own i was halffrightened when i saw him drawing nearer to myself .
he did not know , to be sure , that i had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet i had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that i could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm .
ah , says he , this here is a sweet spot , this islanda sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on .
you'll bathe , and you'll climb trees , and you'll hunt goats , you will ; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself .
why , it makes me young again .
i was going to forget my timber leg , i was .
it's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that .
when you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old john , and he'll put up a snack for you to take along .
and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below .
captain smollett , the squire , and dr .
livesey were talking together on the quarterdeck , and anxious as i was to tell them my story , i durst not interrupt them openly .
while i was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , dr .
livesey called me to his side .
he had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that i should fetch it ; but as soon as i was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , i broke immediately , doctor , let me speak .
get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me .
i have terrible news .
the doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself .
thank you , jim , said he quite loudly , that was all i wanted to know , as if he had asked me a question .
and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two .
they spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that dr .
livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that i heard was the captain giving an order to job anderson , and all hands were piped on deck .
my lads , said captain smollett , i've a word to say to you .
this land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for .
mr. trelawney , being a very openhanded gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as i was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as i never ask to see it done better , why , he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck , and you'll have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck .
i'll tell you what i think of this : i think it handsome .
and if you think as i do , you'll give a good seacheer for the gentleman that does it .
the cheer followedthat was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood .
one more cheer for cap'n smollett , cried long john when the first had subsided .
and this also was given with a will .
on the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin .
i found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , i knew , was a sign that he was agitated .
the stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake .
now , hawkins , said the squire , you have something to say .
speak up .
i did as i was bid , and as short as i could make it , told the whole details of silver's conversation .
nobody interrupted me till i was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last .
jim , said dr .
livesey , take a seat .
and they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage .
now , captain , said the squire , you were right , and i was wrong .
i own myself an ass , and i await your orders .
no more an ass than i , sir , returned the captain .
i never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according .
but this crew , he added , beats me .
captain , said the doctor , with your permission , that's silver .
a very remarkable man .
he'd look remarkably well from a yardarm , sir , returned the captain .
but this is talk ; this don't lead to anything .
i see three or four points , and with mr. trelawney's permission , i'll name them .
you , sir , are the captain .
it is for you to speak , says mr. trelawney grandly .
first point , began mr. smollett .
we must go on , because we can't turn back .
if i gave the word to go about , they would rise at once .
second point , we have time before usat least until this treasure's found .
third point , there are faithful hands .
now , sir , it's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what i propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it .
we can count , i take it , on your own home servants , mr. trelawney ?
as upon myself , declared the squire .
three , reckoned the captain ; ourselves make seven , counting hawkins here .
now , about the honest hands ?
most likely trelawney's own men , said the doctor ; those he had picked up for himself before he lit on silver .
nay , replied the squire .
hands was one of mine .
i did think i could have trusted hands , added the captain .
and to think that they're all englishmen !
broke out the squire .
sir , i could find it in my heart to blow the ship up .
well , gentlemen , said the captain , the best that i can say is not much .
we must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout .
it's trying on a man , i know .
it would be pleasanter to come to blows .
but there's no help for it till we know our men .
lay to , and whistle for a wind , that's my view .
jim here , said the doctor , can help us more than anyone .
the men are not shy with him , and jim is a noticing lad .
hawkins , i put prodigious faith in you , added the squire .
i began to feel pretty desperate at this , for i felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came .
in the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twentysix on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen .
the appearance of the island when i came on deck next morning was altogether changed .
although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the southeast of the low eastern coast .
greycoloured woods covered a large part of the surface .
this even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sandbreak in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , outtopping the otherssome singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad .
the hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock .
all were strangely shaped , and the spyglass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on .
the hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell .
the booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory .
i had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though i was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing i never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach .
perhaps it was thisperhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beachat least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , i hated the very thought of treasure island .
we had a dreary morning's work before us , for there was no sign of any wind , and the boats had to be got out and manned , and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind skeleton island .
i volunteered for one of the boats , where i had , of course , no business .
the heat was sweltering , and the men grumbled fiercely over their work .
anderson was in command of my boat , and instead of keeping the crew in order , he grumbled as loud as the worst .
well , he said with an oath , it's not forever .
i thought this was a very bad sign , for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline .
all the way in , long john stood by the steersman and conned the ship .
he knew the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart , john never hesitated once .
there's a strong scour with the ebb , he said , and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade .
we brought up just where the anchor was in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and skeleton island on the other .
the bottom was clean sand .
the plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods , but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent .
the place was entirely landlocked , buried in woods , the trees coming right down to highwater mark , the shores mostly flat , and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there .
two little rivers , or rather two swamps , emptied out into this pond , as you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness .
from the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they were quite buried among trees ; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion , we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas .
there was not a breath of air moving , nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside .
a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchoragea smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks .
i observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone tasting a bad egg .
i don't know about treasure , he said , but i'll stake my wig there's fever here .
if the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat , it became truly threatening when they had come aboard .
they lay about the deck growling together in talk .
the slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed .
even the honest hands must have caught the infection , for there was not one man aboard to mend another .
mutiny , it was plain , hung over us like a thundercloud .
and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger .
long john was hard at work going from group to group , spending himself in good advice , and as for example no man could have shown a better .
he fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility ; he was all smiles to everyone .
if an order were given , john would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheeriest aye , aye , sir !
in the world ; and when there was nothing else to do , he kept up one song after another , as if to conceal the discontent of the rest .
of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst .
we held a council in the cabin .
sir , said the captain , if i risk another order , the whole ship'll come about our ears by the run .
you see , sir , here it is .
i get a rough answer , do i not ?
well , if i speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if i don't , silver will see there's something under that , and the game's up .
now , we've only one man to rely on .
and who is that ?
asked the squire .
silver , sir , returned the captain ; he's as anxious as you and i to smother things up .
this is a tiff ; he'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what i propose to do is to give him the chance .
let's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
if they all go , why we'll fight the ship .
if they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and god defend the right .
if some go , you mark my words , sir , silver'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs .
it was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; hunter , joyce , and redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew .
my lads , said he , we've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts .
a turn ashore'll hurt nobodythe boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon .
i'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown .
i believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage .
the captain was too bright to be in the way .
he whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving silver to arrange the party , and i fancy it was as well he did so .
had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation .
it was as plain as day .
silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it .
the honest handsand i was soon to see it proved that there were such on boardmust have been very stupid fellows .
or rather , i suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleadersonly some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further .
it is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
at last , however , the party was made up .
six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including silver , began to embark .
then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives .
if six men were left by silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance .
it occurred to me at once to go ashore .
in a jiffy i had slipped over the side and curled up in the foresheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off .
no one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , is that you , jim ?
keep your head down .
but silver , from the other boat , looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me ; and from that moment i began to regret what i had done .
the crews raced for the beach , but the boat i was in , having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned , shot far ahead of her consort , and the bow had struck among the shoreside trees and i had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind .
jim , jim !
i heard him shouting .
but you may suppose i paid no heed ; jumping , ducking , and breaking through , i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer .
i was so pleased at having given the slip to long john that i began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that i was in .
i had crossed a marshy tract full of willows , bulrushes , and odd , outlandish , swampy trees ; and i had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating , sandy country , about a mile long , dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees , not unlike the oak in growth , but pale in the foliage , like willows .
on the far side of the open stood one of the hills , with two quaint , craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun .
i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration .
the isle was uninhabited ; my shipmates i had left behind , and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls .
i turned hither and thither among the trees .
here and there were flowering plants , unknown to me ; here and there i saw snakes , and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top .
little did i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle .
then i came to a long thicket of these oaklike treeslive , or evergreen , oaks , i heard afterwards they should be calledwhich grew low along the sand like brambles , the boughs curiously twisted , the foliage compact , like thatch .
the thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls , spreading and growing taller as it went , until it reached the margin of the broad , reedy fen , through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage .
the marsh was steaming in the strong sun , and the outline of the spyglass trembled through the haze .
all at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes ; a wild duck flew up with a quack , another followed , and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air .
i judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen .
nor was i deceived , for soon i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice , which , as i continued to give ear , grew steadily louder and nearer .
this put me in a great fear , and i crawled under cover of the nearest liveoak and squatted there , hearkening , as silent as a mouse .
another voice answered , and then the first voice , which i now recognized to be silver's , once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream , only now and again interrupted by the other .
by the sound they must have been talking earnestly , and almost fiercely ; but no distinct word came to my hearing .
at last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down , for not only did they cease to draw any nearer , but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp .
and now i began to feel that i was neglecting my business , that since i had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes , the least i could do was to overhear them at their councils , and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as i could manage , under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees .
i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly , not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders .
crawling on all fours , i made steadily but slowly towards them , till at last , raising my head to an aperture among the leaves , i could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh , and closely set about with trees , where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation .
the sun beat full upon them .
silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground , and his great , smooth , blond face , all shining with heat , was lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal .
mate , he was saying , it's because i thinks gold dust of yougold dust , and you may lay to that !
if i hadn't took to you like pitch , do you think i'd have been here awarning of you ?
all's upyou can't make nor mend ; it's to save your neck that i'm aspeaking , and if one of the wild uns knew it , where'd i be , tomnow , tell me , where'd i be ?
silver , said the other manand i observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut ropesilver , says he , you're old , and you're honest , or has the name for it ; and you've money too , which lots of poor sailors hasn't ; and you're brave , or i'm mistook .
and will you tell me you'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
not you !
as sure as god sees me , i'd sooner lose my hand .
if i turn agin my dooty and then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
i had found one of the honest handswell , here , at that same moment , came news of another .
far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , longdrawn scream .
the rocks of the spyglass reechoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marshbirds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had reestablished its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon .
tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but silver had not winked an eye .
he stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring .
john !
said the sailor , stretching out his hand .
hands off !
cried silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast .
hands off , if you like , john silver , said the other .
it's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
but in heaven's name , tell me , what was that ?
that ?
returned silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pinpoint in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass .
that ?
oh , i reckon that'll be alan .
and at this point tom flashed out like a hero .
alan !
he cried .
then rest his soul for a true seaman !
and as for you , john silver , long you've been a mate of mine , but you're mate of mine no more .
if i die like a dog , i'll die in my dooty .
you've killed alan , have you ?
kill me too , if you can .
but i defies you .
and with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach .
but he was not destined to go far .
with a cry john seized the branch of a tree , whipped the crutch out of his armpit , and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air .
it struck poor tom , point foremost , and with stunning violence , right between the shoulders in the middle of his back .
his hands flew up , he gave a sort of gasp , and fell .
whether he were injured much or little , none could ever tell .
like enough , to judge from the sound , his back was broken on the spot .
but he had no time given him to recover .
silver , agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch , was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body .
from my place of ambush , i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows .
i do not know what it rightly is to faint , but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist ; silver and the birds , and the tall spyglass hilltop , going round and round and topsyturvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear .
when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head .
just before him tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his bloodstained knife the while upon a wisp of grass .
everything else was unchanged , the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain , and i could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes .
but now john put his hand into his pocket , brought out a whistle , and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air .
i could not tell , of course , the meaning of the signal , but it instantly awoke my fears .
more men would be coming .
i might be discovered .
they had already slain two of the honest people ; after tom and alan , might not i come next ?
instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again , with what speed and silence i could manage , to the more open portion of the wood .
as i did so , i could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades , and this sound of danger lent me wings .
as soon as i was clear of the thicket , i ran as i never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as i ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy .
indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than i ?
when the gun fired , how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ?
would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe's ?
would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ?
it was all over , i thought .
goodbye to the hispaniola ; goodbye to the squire , the doctor , and the captain !
there was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers .
all this while , as i say , i was still running , and without taking any notice , i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the liveoaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions .
mingled with these were a few scattered pines , some fifty , some nearer seventy , feet high .
the air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh .
and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart .
from the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees .
my eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and i saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine .
what it was , whether bear or man or monkey , i could in no wise tell .
it seemed dark and shaggy ; more i knew not .
but the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand .
i was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript .
and immediately i began to prefer the dangers that i knew to those i knew not .
silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and i turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats .
instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off .
i was tired , at any rate ; but had i been as fresh as when i rose , i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary .
from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that i had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran .
yet a man it was , i could no longer be in doubt about that .
i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals .
i was within an ace of calling for help .
but the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of silver began to revive in proportion .
i stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as i was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind .
as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him .
he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as i began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me .
then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication .
at that i once more stopped .
who are you ?
i asked .
ben gunn , he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock .
i'm poor ben gunn , i am ; and i haven't spoke with a christian these three years .
i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing .
his skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face .
of all the beggarmen that i had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness .
he was clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old seacloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin .
about his waist he wore an old brassbuckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement .
three years !
i cried .
were you shipwrecked ?
nay , mate , said he ; marooned .
i had heard the word , and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island .
marooned three years agone , he continued , and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters .
wherever a man is , says i , a man can do for himself .
but , mate , my heart is sore for christian diet .
you mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?
no ?
well , many's the long night i've dreamed of cheesetoasted , mostlyand woke up again , and here i were .
if ever i can get aboard again , said i , you shall have cheese by the stone .
all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature .
but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
if ever you can get aboard again , says you ?
he repeated .
why , now , who's to hinder you ?
not you , i know , was my reply .
and right you was , he cried .
now youwhat do you call yourself , mate ?
jim , i told him .
jim , jim , says he , quite pleased apparently .
well , now , jim , i've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of .
now , for instance , you wouldn't think i had had a pious motherto look at me ?
he asked .
why , no , not in particular , i answered .
ah , well , said he , but i hadremarkable pious .
and i was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you couldn't tell one word from another .
and here's what it come to , jim , and it begun with chuckfarthen on the blessed gravestones !
that's what it begun with , but it went further'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !
but it were providence that put me here .
i've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and i'm back on piety .
you don't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance i have .
i'm bound i'll be good , and i see the way to .
and , jimlooking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisperi'm rich .
i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : rich !
rich !
i says .
and i'll tell you what : i'll make a man of you , jim .
ah , jim , you'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me !
and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes .
now , jim , you tell me true : that ain't flint's ship ?
he asked .
at this i had a happy inspiration .
i began to believe that i had found an ally , and i answered him at once .
it's not flint's ship , and flint is dead ; but i'll tell you true , as you ask methere are some of flint's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us .
not a manwith oneleg ?
he gasped .
silver ?
i asked .
ah , silver !
says he .
that were his name .
he's the cook , and the ringleader too .
he was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring .
if you was sent by long john , he said , i'm as good as pork , and i know it .
but where was you , do you suppose ?
i had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves .
he heard me with the keenest interest , and when i had done he patted me on the head .
you're a good lad , jim , he said ; and you're all in a clove hitch , ain't you ?
well , you just put your trust in ben gunnben gunn's the man to do it .
would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberalminded one in case of helphim being in a clove hitch , as you remark ?
i told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
aye , but you see , returned ben gunn , i didn't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that's not my mark , jim .
what i mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already ?
i am sure he would , said i .
as it was , all hands were to share .
and a passage home ?
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
why , i cried , the squire's a gentleman .
and besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home .
ah , said he , so you would .
and he seemed very much relieved .
now , i'll tell you what , he went on .
so much i'll tell you , and no more .
i were in flint's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six alongsix strong seamen .
they was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old walrus .
one fine day up went the signal , and here come flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf .
the sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater .
but , there he was , you mind , and the six all deaddead and buried .
how he done it , not a man aboard us could make out .
it was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastwayshim against six .
billy bones was the mate ; long john , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was .
'ah ,' says he , 'you can go ashore , if you like , and stay ,' he says ; 'but as for the ship , she'll beat up for more , by thunder !
'that's what he said .
well , i was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island .
'boys ,' said i , 'here's flint's treasure ; let's land and find it .
'the cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed .
twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard .
'as for you , benjamin gunn ,' says they , 'here's a musket ,' they says , 'and a spade , and pickaxe .
you can stay here and find flint's money for yourself ,' they says .
well , jim , three years have i been here , and not a bite of christian diet from that day to this .
but now , you look here ; look at me .
do i look like a man before the mast ?
no , says you .
nor i weren't , neither , i says .
and with that he winked and pinched me hard .
just you mention them words to your squire , jim , he went on .
nor he weren't , neitherthat's the words .
three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she's alive you'll say ; but the most part of gunn's time this is what you'll saythe most part of his time was took up with another matter .
and then you'll give him a nip , like i do .
and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
then , he continued , then you'll up , and you'll say this : gunn is a good man you'll say , and he puts a precious sight more confidencea precious sight , mind thatin a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune , having been one hisself .
well , i said , i don't understand one word that you've been saying .
but that's neither here nor there ; for how am i to get on board ?
ah , said he , that's the hitch , for sure .
well , there's my boat , that i made with my two hands .
i keep her under the white rock .
if the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark .
hi !
he broke out .
what's that ?
for just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon .
they have begun to fight !
i cried .
follow me .
and i began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly .
left , left , says he ; keep to your left hand , mate jim !
under the trees with you !
theer's where i killed my first goat .
they don't come down here now ; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of benjamin gunn .
ah !
and there's the cetemerycemetery , he must have meant .
you see the mounds ?
i come here and prayed , nows and thens , when i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo .
it weren't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , ben gunn was shorthandedno chapling , nor so much as a bible and a flag , you says .
so he kept talking as i ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer .
the cannonshot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , i beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood .
it was about half past onethree bells in the sea phrasethat the two boats went ashore from the hispaniola .
the captain , the squire , and i were talking matters over in the cabin .
had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea .
but the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came hunter with the news that jim hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest .
it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins , but we were alarmed for his safety .
with the men in the temper they were in , it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again .
we ran on deck .
the pitch was bubbling in the seams ; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick ; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery , it was in that abominable anchorage .
the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each , hard by where the river runs in .
one of them was whistling lillibullero .
waiting was a strain , and it was decided that hunter and i should go ashore with the jollyboat in quest of information .
the gigs had leaned to their right , but hunter and i pulled straight in , in the direction of the stockade upon the chart .
the two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance ; lillibullero stopped off , and i could see the pair discussing what they ought to do .
had they gone and told silver , all might have turned out differently ; but they had their orders , i suppose , and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero .
there was a slight bend in the coast , and i steered so as to put it between us ; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs .
i jumped out and came as near running as i durst , with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety .
i had not gone a hundred yards when i reached the stockade .
this was how it was : a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll .
well , on the knoll , and enclosing the spring , they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side .
all round this they had cleared a wide space , and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high , without door or opening , too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers .
the people in the loghouse had them in every way ; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges .
all they wanted was a good watch and food ; for , short of a complete surprise , they might have held the place against a regiment .
what particularly took my fancy was the spring .
for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola , with plenty of arms and ammunition , and things to eat , and excellent wines , there had been one thing overlookedwe had no water .
i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death .
i was not new to violent deathi have served his royal highness the duke of cumberland , and got a wound myself at fontenoybut i know my pulse went dot and carry one .
jim hawkins is gone , was my first thought .
it is something to have been an old soldier , but more still to have been a doctor .
there is no time to dillydally in our work .
and so now i made up my mind instantly , and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jollyboat .
by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar .
we made the water fly , and the boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner .
i found them all shaken , as was natural .
the squire was sitting down , as white as a sheet , thinking of the harm he had led us to , the good soul !
and one of the six forecastle hands was little better .
there's a man , says captain smollett , nodding towards him , new to this work .
he came nighhand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry .
another touch of the rudder and that man would join us .
i told my plan to the captain , and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment .
we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle , with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection .
hunter brought the boat round under the sternport , and joyce and i set to work loading her with powder tins , muskets , bags of biscuits , kegs of pork , a cask of cognac , and my invaluable medicine chest .
in the meantime , the squire and the captain stayed on deck , and the latter hailed the coxswain , who was the principal man aboard .
mr .
hands , he said , here are two of us with a brace of pistols each .
if any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man's dead .
they were a good deal taken aback , and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion , thinking no doubt to take us on the rear .
but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley , they went about ship at once , and a head popped out again on deck .
down , dog !
cries the captain .
and the head popped back again ; and we heard no more , for the time , of these six very fainthearted seamen .
by this time , tumbling things in as they came , we had the jollyboat loaded as much as we dared .
joyce and i got out through the sternport , and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us .
this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore .
lillibullero was dropped again ; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point , one of them whipped ashore and disappeared .
i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats , but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand , and all might very well be lost by trying for too much .
we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house .
all three made the first journey , heavily laden , and tossed our stores over the palisade .
then , leaving joyce to guard themone man , to be sure , but with half a dozen musketshunter and i returned to the jollyboat and loaded ourselves once more .
so we proceeded without pausing to take breath , till the whole cargo was bestowed , when the two servants took up their position in the block house , and i , with all my power , sculled back to the hispaniola .
that we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was .
they had the advantage of numbers , of course , but we had the advantage of arms .
not one of the men ashore had a musket , and before they could get within range for pistol shooting , we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a halfdozen at least .
the squire was waiting for me at the stern window , all his faintness gone from him .
he caught the painter and made it fast , and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives .
pork , powder , and biscuit was the cargo , with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and redruth and the captain .
the rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water , so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun , on the clean , sandy bottom .
by this time the tide was beginning to ebb , and the ship was swinging round to her anchor .
voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs ; and though this reassured us for joyce and hunter , who were well to the eastward , it warned our party to be off .
redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat , which we then brought round to the ship's counter , to be handier for captain smollett .
now , men , said he , do you hear me ?
there was no answer from the forecastle .
it's to you , abraham grayit's to you i am speaking .
still no reply .
gray , resumed mr. smollett , a little louder , i am leaving this ship , and i order you to follow your captain .
i know you are a good man at bottom , and i dare say not one of the lot of you's as bad as he makes out .
i have my watch here in my hand ; i give you thirty seconds to join me in .
there was a pause .
come , my fine fellow , continued the captain ; don't hang so long in stays .
i'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second .
there was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst abraham gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle .
i'm with you , sir , said he .
and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way .
we were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade .
this fifth trip was quite different from any of the others .
in the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded .
five grown men , and three of themtrelawney , redruth , and the captainover six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry .
add to that the powder , pork , and breadbags .
the gunwale was lipping astern .
several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards .
the captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly .
all the same , we were afraid to breathe .
in the second place , the ebb was now makinga strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south'ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning .
even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landingplace behind the point .
if we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment .
i cannot keep her head for the stockade , sir , said i to the captain .
i was steering , while he and redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars .
the tide keeps washing her down .
could you pull a little stronger ?
not without swamping the boat , said he .
you must bear up , sir , if you pleasebear up until you see you're gaining .
i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go .
we'll never get ashore at this rate , said i .
if it's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , returned the captain .
we must keep upstream .
you see , sir , he went on , if once we dropped to leeward of the landingplace , it's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore .
the current's less a'ready , sir , said the man gray , who was sitting in the foresheets ; you can ease her off a bit .
thank you , my man , said i , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves .
suddenly the captain spoke up again , and i thought his voice was a little changed .
the gun !
said he .
i have thought of that , said i , for i made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort .
they could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods .
look astern , doctor , replied the captain .
we had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed .
not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the roundshot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad .
israel was flint's gunner , said gray hoarsely .
at any risk , we put the boat's head direct for the landingplace .
by this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and i could keep her steady for the goal .
but the worst of it was that with the course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door .
i could hear as well as see that brandyfaced rascal israel hands plumping down a roundshot on the deck .
who's the best shot ?
asked the captain .
mr .
trelawney , out and away , said i .
mr .
trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ?
hands , if possible , said the captain .
trelawney was as cool as steel .
he looked to the priming of his gun .
now , cried the captain , easy with that gun , sir , or you'll swamp the boat .
all hands stand by to trim her when he aims .
the squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop .
they had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed .
however , we had no luck , for just as trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell .
the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats .
here come the gigs , sir , said i .
give way , then , cried the captain .
we mustn't mind if we swamp her now .
if we can't get ashore , all's up .
only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , i added ; the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off .
they'll have a hot run , sir , returned the captain .
jack ashore , you know .
it's not them i mind ; it's the roundshot .
carpet bowls !
my lady's maid couldn't miss .
tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we'll hold water .
in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process .
we were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees .
the gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes .
the ebbtide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants .
the one source of danger was the gun .
if i durst , said the captain , i'd stop and pick off another man .
but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot .
they had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and i could see him trying to crawl away .
ready !
cried the squire .
hold !
cried the captain , quick as an echo .
and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water .
the report fell in at the same instant of time .
this was the first that jim heard , the sound of the squire's shot not having reached him .
where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but i fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster .
at any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet .
the other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling .
so far there was no great harm .
no lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety .
but there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service .
mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct .
as for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost .
the other three had gone down with the boat .
to add to our concern , we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore , and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our halfcrippled state but the fear before us whether , if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen , they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm .
hunter was steady , that we knew ; joyce was a doubtful casea pleasant , polite man for a valet and to brush one's clothes , but not entirely fitted for a man of war .
with all this in our minds , we waded ashore as fast as we could , leaving behind us the poor jollyboat and a good half of all our powder and provisions .
we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade , and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer .
soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket .
i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming .
captain , said i , trelawney is the dead shot .
give him your gun ; his own is useless .
they exchanged guns , and trelawney , silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle , hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service .
at the same time , observing gray to be unarmed , i handed him my cutlass .
it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand , knit his brows , and make the blade sing through the air .
it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt .
forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us .
we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side , and almost at the same time , seven mutineersjob anderson , the boatswain , at their headappeared in full cry at the southwestern corner .
they paused as if taken aback , and before they recovered , not only the squire and i , but hunter and joyce from the block house , had time to fire .
the four shots came in rather a scattering volley , but they did the business : one of the enemy actually fell , and the rest , without hesitation , turned and plunged into the trees .
after reloading , we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy .
he was stone deadshot through the heart .
we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush , a ball whistled close past my ear , and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground .
both the squire and i returned the shot , but as we had nothing to aim at , it is probable we only wasted powder .
then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom .
the captain and gray were already examining him , and i saw with half an eye that all was over .
i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more , for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried , groaning and bleeding , into the loghouse .
poor old fellow , he had not uttered one word of surprise , complaint , fear , or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now , when we had laid him down in the loghouse to die .
he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery ; he had followed every order silently , doggedly , and well ; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years ; and now , sullen , old , serviceable servant , it was he that was to die .
the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand , crying like a child .
be i going , doctor ?
he asked .
tom , my man , said i , you're going home .
i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first , he replied .
tom , said the squire , say you forgive me , won't you ?
would that be respectful like , from me to you , squire ?
was the answer .
howsoever , so be it , amen !
after a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer .
it's the custom , sir , he added apologetically .
and not long after , without another word , he passed away .
in the meantime the captain , whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various storesthe british colours , a bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the logbook , and pounds of tobacco .
he had found a longish firtree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the loghouse where the trunks crossed and made an angle .
then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours .
this seemed mightily to relieve him .
he reentered the loghouse and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
but he had an eye on tom's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body .
don't you take on , sir , he said , shaking the squire's hand .
all's well with him ; no fear for a hand that's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
it mayn't be good divinity , but it's a fact .
then he pulled me aside .
dr .
livesey , he said , in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ?
i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later .
you can calculate for yourself , i said .
why , yes , returned the captain , scratching his head ; and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of providence , i should say we were pretty close hauled .
how do you mean ?
i asked .
it's a pity , sir , we lost that second load .
that's what i mean , replied the captain .
as for powder and shot , we'll do .
but the rations are short , very shortso short , dr .
livesey , that we're perhaps as well without that extra mouth .
and he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
just then , with a roar and a whistle , a roundshot passed high above the roof of the loghouse and plumped far beyond us in the wood .
oho !
said the captain .
blaze away !
you've little enough powder already , my lads .
at the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage .
captain , said the squire , the house is quite invisible from the ship .
it must be the flag they are aiming at .
would it not be wiser to take it in ?
strike my colours !
cried the captain .
no , sir , not i ; and as soon as he had said the words , i think we all agreed with him .
for it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade .
all through the evening they kept thundering away .
ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand .
we had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the loghouse and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horseplay and minded it no more than cricket .
there is one good thing about all this , observed the captain ; the wood in front of us is likely clear .
the ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered .
volunteers to go and bring in pork .
gray and hunter were the first to come forward .
well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission .
the mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israel's gunnery .
for four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current .
silver was in the sternsheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own .
the captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : alexander smollett , master ; david livesey , ship's doctor ; abraham gray , carpenter's mate ; john trelawney , owner ; john hunter and richard joyce , owner's servants , landsmenbeing all that is left faithful of the ship's companywith stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew british colours on the loghouse in treasure island .
thomas redruth , owner's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; james hawkins , cabinboy and at the same time , i was wondering over poor jim hawkins' fate .
a hail on the land side .
somebody hailing us , said hunter , who was on guard .
doctor !
squire !
captain !
hullo , hunter , is that you ?
came the cries .
and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade .
as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down .
now , said he , there's your friends , sure enough .
far more likely it's the mutineers , i answered .
that !
he cried .
why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune , silver would fly the jolly roger , you don't make no doubt of that .
no , that's your friends .
there's been blows too , and i reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by flint .
ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was flint !
barring rum , his match were never seen .
he were afraid of none , not he ; on'y silversilver was that genteel .
well , said i , that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that i should hurry on and join my friends .
nay , mate , returned ben , not you .
you're a good boy , or i'm mistook ; but you're on'y a boy , all told .
now , ben gunn is fly .
rum wouldn't bring me there , where you're goingnot rum wouldn't , till i see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour .
and you won't forget my words ; 'a precious sight that's what you'll say , a precious sight more confidence'and then nips him .
and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
and when ben gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , jim .
just wheer you found him today .
and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he's to come alone .
oh !
and you'll say this : 'ben gunn ,' says you , 'has reasons of his own .
'well , said i , i believe i understand .
you have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you're to be found where i found you .
is that all ?
and when ?
says you , he added .
why , from about noon observation to about six bells .
good , said i , and now may i go ?
you won't forget ?
he inquired anxiously .
precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you .
reasons of his own ; that's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
well , thenstill holding mei reckon you can go , jim .
and , jim , if you was to see silver , you wouldn't go for to sell ben gunn ?
wild horses wouldn't draw it from you ?
no , says you .
and if them pirates camp ashore , jim , what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning ?
here he was interrupted by a loud report , and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking .
the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction .
for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island , and balls kept crashing through the woods .
i moved from hidingplace to hidingplace , always pursued , or so it seemed to me , by these terrifying missiles .
but towards the end of the bombardment , though still i durst not venture in the direction of the stockade , where the balls fell oftenest , i had begun , in a manner , to pluck up my heart again , and after a long detour to the east , crept down among the shoreside trees .
the sun had just set , the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage ; the tide , too , was far out , and great tracts of sand lay uncovered ; the air , after the heat of the day , chilled me through my jacket .
the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored ; but , sure enough , there was the jolly rogerthe black flag of piracyflying from her peak .
even as i looked , there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering , and one more roundshot whistled through the air .
it was the last of the cannonade .
i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack .
men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockadethe poor jollyboat , i afterwards discovered .
away , near the mouth of the river , a great fire was glowing among the trees , and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going , the men , whom i had seen so gloomy , shouting at the oars like children .
but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum .
at length i thought i might return towards the stockade .
i was pretty far down on the low , sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east , and is joined at halfwater to skeleton island ; and now , as i rose to my feet , i saw , some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes , an isolated rock , pretty high , and peculiarly white in colour .
it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one .
then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear , or shoreward side , of the stockade , and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party .
i had soon told my story and began to look about me .
the loghouse was made of unsquared trunks of pineroof , walls , and floor .
the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand .
there was a porch at the door , and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kindno other than a great ship's kettle of iron , with the bottom knocked out , and sunk to her bearings , as the captain said , among the sand .
little had been left besides the framework of the house , but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire .
the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house , and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed .
most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees ; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand .
very close around the stockadetoo close for defence , they saidthe wood still flourished high and dense , all of fir on the land side , but towards the sea with a large admixture of liveoaks .
the cold evening breeze , of which i have spoken , whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand .
there was sand in our eyes , sand in our teeth , sand in our suppers , sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle , for all the world like porridge beginning to boil .
our chimney was a square hole in the roof ; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out , and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye .
add to this that gray , the new man , had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old tom redruth , still unburied , lay along the wall , stiff and stark , under the union jack .
if we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but captain smollett was never the man for that .
all hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches .
the doctor and gray and i for one ; the squire , hunter , and joyce upon the other .
tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; i was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted .
from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me .
that man smollett , he said once , is a better man than i am .
and when i say that it means a deal , jim .
another time he came and was silent for a while .
then he put his head on one side , and looked at me .
is this ben gunn a man ?
he asked .
i do not know , sir , said i .
i am not very sure whether he's sane .
if there's any doubt about the matter , he is , returned the doctor .
a man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , jim , can't expect to appear as sane as you or me .
it doesn't lie in human nature .
was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ?
yes , sir , cheese , i answered .
well , jim , says he , just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food .
you've seen my snuffbox , haven't you ?
and you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuffbox i carry a piece of parmesan cheesea cheese made in italy , very nutritious .
well , that's for ben gunn !
before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze .
a good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier .
then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects .
it appears they were at their wits' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came .
but our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola .
from nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at leastthe man shot beside the gunseverely wounded , if he were not dead .
every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care .
and besides that , we had two able alliesrum and the climate .
as for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week .
so , he added , if we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to be packing in the schooner .
it's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , i suppose .
first ship that ever i lost , said captain smollett .
i was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when i got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , i slept like a log of wood .
the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
flag of truce !
i heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , silver himself !
and at that , up i jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall .
sure enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than silver himself , standing placidly by .
it was still quite early , and the coldest morning that i think i ever was abroad ina chill that pierced into the marrow .
the sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun .
but where silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded kneedeep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass .
the chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
it was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot .
keep indoors , men , said the captain .
ten to one this is a trick .
then he hailed the buccaneer .
who goes ?
stand , or we fire .
flag of truce , cried silver .
the captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended .
he turned and spoke to us , doctor's watch on the lookout .
dr .
livesey take the north side , if you please ; jim , the east ; gray , west .
the watch below , all hands to load muskets .
lively , men , and careful .
and then he turned again to the mutineers .
and what do you want with your flag of truce ?
he cried .
this time it was the other man who replied .
cap'n silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , he shouted .
cap'n silver !
don't know him .
who's he ?
cried the captain .
and we could hear him adding to himself , cap'n , is it ?
my heart , and here's promotion !
long john answered for himself .
me , sir .
these poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sirlaying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion .
we're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it .
all i ask is your word , cap'n smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired .
my man , said captain smollett , i have not the slightest desire to talk to you .
if you wish to talk to me , you can come , that's all .
if there's any treachery , it'll be on your side , and the lord help you .
that's enough , cap'n , shouted long john cheerily .
a word from you's enough .
i know a gentleman , and you may lay to that .
we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold silver back .
nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer .
but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd .
then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side .
i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , i had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand .
he was whistling come , lasses and lads .
silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll .
what with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays .
but he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style .
he was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head .
here you are , my man , said the captain , raising his head .
you had better sit down .
you ain't agoing to let me inside , cap'n ?
complained long john .
it's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand .
why , silver , said the captain , if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley .
it's your own doing .
you're either my ship's cookand then you were treated handsomeor cap'n silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang !
well , well , cap'n , returned the seacook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , you'll have to give me a hand up again , that's all .
a sweet pretty place you have of it here .
ah , there's jim !
the top of the morning to you , jim .
doctor , here's my service .
why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking .
if you have anything to say , my man , better say it , said the captain .
right you were , cap'n smollett , replied silver .
dooty is dooty , to be sure .
well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night .
i don't deny it was a good lay .
some of you pretty handy with a handspikeend .
and i'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shookmaybe all was shook ; maybe i was shook myself ; maybe that's why i'm here for terms .
but you mark me , cap'n , it won't do twice , by thunder !
we'll have to do sentrygo and ease off a point or so on the rum .
maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye .
but i'll tell you i was sober ; i was on'y dog tired ; and if i'd awoke a second sooner , i'd 'a caught you at the act , i would .
he wasn't dead when i got round to him , not he .
well ?
says captain smollett as cool as can be .
all that silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone .
as for me , i began to have an inkling .
ben gunn's last words came back to my mind .
i began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with .
well , here it is , said silver .
we want that treasure , and we'll have itthat's our point !
you would just as soon save your lives , i reckon ; and that's yours .
you have a chart , haven't you ?
that's as may be , replied the captain .
oh , well , you have , i know that , returned long john .
you needn't be so husky with a man ; there ain't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it .
what i mean is , we want your chart .
now , i never meant you no harm , myself .
that won't do with me , my man , interrupted the captain .
we know exactly what you meant to do , and we don't care , for now , you see , you can't do it .
and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
if abe gray silver broke out .
avast there !
cried mr. smollett .
gray told me nothing , and i asked him nothing ; and what's more , i would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first .
so there's my mind for you , my man , on that .
this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down .
he had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together .
like enough , said he .
i would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were .
and seein' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , i'll make so free as do likewise .
and he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit .
it was as good as the play to see them .
now , resumed silver , here it is .
you give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep .
you do that , and we'll offer you a choice .
either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then i'll give you my affydavy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore .
or if that ain't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can .
we'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and i'll give my affydavy , as before to speak the first ship i sight , and send 'em here to pick you up .
now , you'll own that's talking .
handsomer you couldn't look to get , now you .
and i hoperaising his voicethat all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all .
captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
is that all ?
he asked .
every last word , by thunder !
answered john .
refuse that , and you've seen the last of me but musketballs .
very good , said the captain .
now you'll hear me .
if you'll come up one by one , unarmed , i'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in england .
if you won't , my name is alexander smollett , i've flown my sovereign's colours , and i'll see you all to davy jones .
you can't find the treasure .
you can't sail the shipthere's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
you can't fight usgray , there , got away from five of you .
your ship's in irons , master silver ; you're on a lee shore , and so you'll find .
i stand here and tell you so ; and they're the last good words you'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , i'll put a bullet in your back when next i meet you .
tramp , my lad .
bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick .
silver's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
he shook the fire out of his pipe .
give me a hand up !
he cried .
not i , returned the captain .
who'll give me a hand up ?
he roared .
not a man among us moved .
growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch .
then he spat into the spring .
there !
he cried .
that's what i think of ye .
before an hour's out , i'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon .
laugh , by thunder , laugh !
before an hour's out , ye'll laugh upon the other side .
them that die'll be the lucky ones .
and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees .
as soon as silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but gray .
it was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
quarters !
he roared .
and then , as we all slunk back to our places , gray , he said , i'll put your name in the log ; you've stood by your duty like a seaman .
mr. trelawney , i'm surprised at you , sir .
doctor , i thought you had worn the king's coat !
if that was how you served at fontenoy , sir , you'd have been better in your berth .
the doctor's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is .
the captain looked on for a while in silence .
then he spoke .
my lads , said he , i've given silver a broadside .
i pitched it in redhot on purpose ; and before the hour's out , as he said , we shall be boarded .
we're outnumbered , i needn't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline .
i've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose .
then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear .
on the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five .
there was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four pilestables , you might sayone about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders .
in the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged .
toss out the fire , said the captain ; the chill is past , and we mustn't have smoke in our eyes .
the iron firebasket was carried bodily out by mr. trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand .
hawkins hasn't had his breakfast .
hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , continued captain smollett .
lively , now , my lad ; you'll want it before you've done .
hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands .
and while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence .
doctor , you will take the door , he resumed .
see , and don't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch .
hunter , take the east side , there .
joyce , you stand by the west , my man .
mr. trelawney , you are the best shotyou and gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it's there the danger is .
if they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty .
hawkins , neither you nor i are much account at the shooting ; we'll stand by to load and bear a hand .
as the captain had said , the chill was past .
as soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught .
soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house .
jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety .
an hour passed away .
hang them !
said the captain .
this is as dull as the doldrums .
gray , whistle for a wind .
and just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
if you please , sir , said joyce , if i see anyone , am i to fire ?
i told you so !
cried the captain .
thank you , sir , returned joyce with the same quiet civility .
nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyesthe musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face .
so some seconds passed , till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket and fired .
the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure .
several bullets struck the loghouse , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before .
not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musketbarrel betrayed the presence of our foes .
did you hit your man ?
asked the captain .
no , sir , replied joyce .
i believe not , sir .
next best thing to tell the truth , muttered captain smollett .
load his gun , hawkins .
how many should say there were on your side , doctor ?
i know precisely , said dr .
livesey .
three shots were fired on this side .
i saw the three flashestwo close togetherone farther to the west .
three !
repeated the captain .
and how many on yours , mr. trelawney ?
but this was not so easily answered .
there had come many from the northseven by the squire's computation , eight or nine according to gray .
from the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
it was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities .
but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements .
if the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade , he argued , they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold .
nor had we much time left to us for thought .
suddenly , with a loud huzza , a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade .
at the same moment , the fire was once more opened from the woods , and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits .
the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys .
squire and gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside .
but of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees .
two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the loghouse .
the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building , shouting as they ran , and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them .
several shots were fired , but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect .
in a moment , the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us .
the head of job anderson , the boatswain , appeared at the middle loophole .
at 'em , all handsall hands !
he roared in a voice of thunder .
at the same moment , another pirate grasped hunter's musket by the muzzle , wrenched it from his hands , plucked it through the loophole , and with one stunning blow , laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor .
meanwhile a third , running unharmed all around the house , appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor .
our position was utterly reversed .
a moment since we were firing , under cover , at an exposed enemy ; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow .
the loghouse was full of smoke , to which we owed our comparative safety .
cries and confusion , the flashes and reports of pistolshots , and one loud groan rang in my ears .
out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open !
cutlasses !
cried the captain .
i snatched a cutlass from the pile , and someone , at the same time snatching another , gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly felt .
i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight .
someone was close behind , i knew not whom .
right in front , the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill , and just as my eyes fell upon him , beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face .
round the house , lads !
round the house !
cried the captain ; and even in the hurlyburly , i perceived a change in his voice .
mechanically , i obeyed , turned eastwards , and with my cutlass raised , ran round the corner of the house .
next moment i was face to face with anderson .
he roared aloud , and his hanger went up above his head , flashing in the sunlight .
i had not time to be afraid , but as the blow still hung impending , leaped in a trice upon one side , and missing my foot in the soft sand , rolled headlong down the slope .
when i had first sallied from the door , the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us .
one man , in a red nightcap , with his cutlass in his mouth , had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across .
well , so short had been the interval that when i found my feet again all was in the same posture , the fellow with the red nightcap still halfway over , another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade .
and yet , in this breath of time , the fight was over and the victory was ours .
gray , following close behind me , had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow .
another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony , the pistol still smoking in his hand .
a third , as i had seen , the doctor had disposed of at a blow .
of the four who had scaled the palisade , one only remained unaccounted for , and he , having left his cutlass on the field , was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him .
firefire from the house !
cried the doctor .
and you , lads , back into cover .
but his words were unheeded , no shot was fired , and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood .
in three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen , four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade .
the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter .
the survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets , and at any moment the fire might recommence .
the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke , and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory .
hunter lay beside his loophole , stunned ; joyce by his , shot through the head , never to move again ; while right in the centre , the squire was supporting the captain , one as pale as the other .
the captain's wounded , said mr. trelawney .
have they run ?
asked mr. smollett .
all that could , you may be bound , returned the doctor ; but there's five of them will never run again .
five !
cried the captain .
come , that's better .
five against three leaves us four to nine .
that's better odds than we had at starting .
we were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that's as bad to bear .
 the mutineers were soon only eight in number , for the man shot by mr. trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound .
but this was , of course , not known till after by the faithful party .
there was no return of the mutineersnot so much as another shot out of the woods .
they had got their rations for that day , as the captain put it , and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner .
squire and i cooked outside in spite of the danger , and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at , for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients .
out of the eight men who had fallen in the action , only three still breathedthat one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole , hunter , and captain smollett ; and of these , the first two were as good as dead ; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife , and hunter , do what we could , never recovered consciousness in this world .
he lingered all day , breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit , but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling , and some time in the following night , without sign or sound , he went to his maker .
as for the captain , his wounds were grievous indeed , but not dangerous .
no organ was fatally injured .
anderson's ballfor it was job that shot him firsthad broken his shoulderblade and touched the lung , not badly ; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf .
he was sure to recover , the doctor said , but in the meantime , and for weeks to come , he must not walk nor move his arm , nor so much as speak when he could help it .
my own accidental cut across the knuckles was a fleabite .
doctor livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain .
after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side awhile in consultation ; and when they had talked to their hearts' content , it being then a little past noon , the doctor took up his hat and pistols , girt on a cutlass , put the chart in his pocket , and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees .
gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the block house , to be out of earshot of our officers consulting ; and gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again , so thunderstruck he was at this occurrence .
why , in the name of davy jones , said he , is dr .
livesey mad ?
why no , says i .
he's about the last of this crew for that , i take it .
well , shipmate , said gray , mad he may not be ; but if he's not , you mark my words , i am .
i take it , replied i , the doctor has his idea ; and if i am right , he's going now to see ben gunn .
i was right , as appeared later ; but in the meantime , the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun , i began to get another thought into my head , which was not by any means so right .
what i began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines , while i sat grilling , with my clothes stuck to the hot resin , and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that i took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear .
all the time i was washing out the block house , and then washing up the things from dinner , this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger , till at last , being near a breadbag , and no one then observing me , i took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit .
i was a fool , if you like , and certainly i was going to do a foolish , overbold act ; but i was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power .
these biscuits , should anything befall me , would keep me , at least , from starving till far on in the next day .
the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols , and as i already had a powderhorn and bullets , i felt myself well supplied with arms .
as for the scheme i had in my head , it was not a bad one in itself .
i was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea , find the white rock i had observed last evening , and ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat , a thing quite worth doing , as i still believe .
but as i was certain i should not be allowed to leave the enclosure , my only plan was to take french leave and slip out when nobody was watching , and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong .
but i was only a boy , and i had made my mind up .
well , as things at last fell out , i found an admirable opportunity .
the squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages , the coast was clear , i made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees , and before my absence was observed i was out of cry of my companions .
this was my second folly , far worse than the first , as i left but two sound men to guard the house ; but like the first , it was a help towards saving all of us .
i took my way straight for the east coast of the island , for i was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage .
it was already late in the afternoon , although still warm and sunny .
as i continued to thread the tall woods , i could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf , but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual .
soon cool draughts of air began to reach me , and a few steps farther i came forth into the open borders of the grove , and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach .
i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island .
the sun might blaze overhead , the air be without a breath , the surface smooth and blue , but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast , thundering and thundering by day and night ; and i scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise .
i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment , till , thinking i was now got far enough to the south , i took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit .
behind me was the sea , in front the anchorage .
the sea breeze , as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence , was already at an end ; it had been succeeded by light , variable airs from the south and southeast , carrying great banks of fog ; and the anchorage , under lee of skeleton island , lay still and leaden as when first we entered it .
the hispaniola , in that unbroken mirror , was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline , the jolly roger hanging from her peak .
alongside lay one of the gigs , silver in the sternsheetshim i could always recognizewhile a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks , one of them with a red capthe very rogue that i had seen some hours before stridelegs upon the palisade .
apparently they were talking and laughing , though at that distanceupwards of a milei could , of course , hear no word of what was said .
all at once there began the most horrid , unearthly screaming , which at first startled me badly , though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her master's wrist .
soon after , the jollyboat shoved off and pulled for shore , and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion .
just about the same time , the sun had gone down behind the spyglass , and as the fog was collecting rapidly , it began to grow dark in earnest .
i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening .
the white rock , visible enough above the brush , was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit , and it took me a goodish while to get up with it , crawling , often on all fours , among the scrub .
night had almost come when i laid my hand on its rough sides .
right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf , hidden by banks and a thick underwood about kneedeep , that grew there very plentifully ; and in the centre of the dell , sure enough , a little tent of goatskins , like what the gipsies carry about with them in england .
i dropped into the hollow , lifted the side of the tent , and there was ben gunn's boathomemade if ever anything was homemade ; a rude , lopsided framework of tough wood , and stretched upon that a covering of goatskin , with the hair inside .
the thing was extremely small , even for me , and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a fullsized man .
there was one thwart set as low as possible , a kind of stretcher in the bows , and a double paddle for propulsion .
i had not then seen a coracle , such as the ancient britons made , but i have seen one since , and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man .
but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed , for it was exceedingly light and portable .
well , now that i had found the boat , you would have thought i had had enough of truantry for once , but in the meantime i had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried it out , i believe , in the teeth of captain smollett himself .
this was to slip out under cover of the night , cut the hispaniola adrift , and let her go ashore where she fancied .
i had quite made up my mind that the mutineers , after their repulse of the morning , had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea ; this , i thought , it would be a fine thing to prevent , and now that i had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat , i thought it might be done with little risk .
down i sat to wait for darkness , and made a hearty meal of biscuit .
it was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose .
the fog had now buried all heaven .
as the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared , absolute blackness settled down on treasure island .
and when , at last , i shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where i had supped , there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage .
one was the great fire on shore , by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp .
the other , a mere blur of light upon the darkness , indicated the position of the anchored ship .
she had swung round to the ebbher bow was now towards methe only lights on board were in the cabin , and what i saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window .
the ebb had already run some time , and i had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand , where i sank several times above the ankle , before i came to the edge of the retreating water , and wading a little way in , with some strength and dexterity , set my coracle , keel downwards , on the surface .
the coracleas i had ample reason to know before i was done with herwas a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight , both buoyant and clever in a seaway ; but she was the most crossgrained , lopsided craft to manage .
do as you pleased , she always made more leeway than anything else , and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at .
even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way .
certainly i did not know her way .
she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go ; the most part of the time we were broadside on , and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide .
by good fortune , paddle as i pleased , the tide was still sweeping me down ; and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway , hardly to be missed .
first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness , then her spars and hull began to take shape , and the next moment , as it seemed for , the farther i went , the brisker grew the current of the ebb , i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold .
the hawser was as taut as a bowstring , and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor .
all round the hull , in the blackness , the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream .
one cut with my seagully and the hispaniola would go humming down the tide .
so far so good , but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser , suddenly cut , is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse .
ten to one , if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor , i and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water .
this brought me to a full stop , and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me , i should have had to abandon my design .
but the light airs which had begun blowing from the southeast and south had hauled round after nightfall into the southwest .
just while i was meditating , a puff came , caught the hispaniola , and forced her up into the current ; and to my great joy , i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp , and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water .
with that i made my mind up , took out my gully , opened it with my teeth , and cut one strand after another , till the vessel swung only by two .
then i lay quiet , waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind .
all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin , but to say truth , my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear .
now , however , when i had nothing else to do , i began to pay more heed .
one i recognized for the coxswain's , israel hands , that had been flint's gunner in former days .
the other was , of course , my friend of the red nightcap .
both men were plainly the worse of drink , and they were still drinking , for even while i was listening , one of them , with a drunken cry , opened the stern window and threw out something , which i divined to be an empty bottle .
but they were not only tipsy ; it was plain that they were furiously angry .
oaths flew like hailstones , and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end in blows .
but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while , until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result .
on shore , i could see the glow of the great campfire burning warmly through the shoreside trees .
someone was singing , a dull , old , droning sailor's song , with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse , and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer .
i had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words : but one man of her crew alive , what put to sea with seventyfive .
and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning .
but , indeed , from what i saw , all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on .
at last the breeze came ; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark ; i felt the hawser slacken once more , and with a good , tough effort , cut the last fibres through .
the breeze had but little action on the coracle , and i was almost instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola .
at the same time , the schooner began to turn upon her heel , spinning slowly , end for end , across the current .
i wrought like a fiend , for i expected every moment to be swamped ; and since i found i could not push the coracle directly off , i now shoved straight astern .
at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour , and just as i gave the last impulsion , my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks .
instantly i grasped it .
why i should have done so i can hardly say .
it was at first mere instinct , but once i had it in my hands and found it fast , curiosity began to get the upper hand , and i determined i should have one look through the cabin window .
i pulled in hand over hand on the cord , and when i judged myself near enough , rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin .
by this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water ; indeed , we had already fetched up level with the campfire .
the ship was talking , as sailors say , loudly , treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash ; and until i got my eye above the windowsill i could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm .
one glance , however , was sufficient ; and it was only one glance that i durst take from that unsteady skiff .
it showed me hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle , each with a hand upon the other's throat .
i dropped upon the thwart again , none too soon , for i was near overboard .
i could see nothing for the moment but these two furious , encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp , and i shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness .
the endless ballad had come to an end at last , and the whole diminished company about the campfire had broken into the chorus i had heard so often : fifteen men on the dead man's chest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
drink and the devil had done for the rest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
i was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the hispaniola , when i was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle .
at the same moment , she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course .
the speed in the meantime had strangely increased .
i opened my eyes at once .
all round me were little ripples , combing over with a sharp , bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent .
the hispaniola herself , a few yards in whose wake i was still being whirled along , seemed to stagger in her course , and i saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night ; nay , as i looked longer , i made sure she also was wheeling to the southward .
i glanced over my shoulder , and my heart jumped against my ribs .
there , right behind me , was the glow of the campfire .
the current had turned at right angles , sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ; ever quickening , ever bubbling higher , ever muttering louder , it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea .
suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw , turning , perhaps , through twenty degrees ; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board ; i could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and i knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster .
i lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its maker .
at the end of the straits , i made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers , where all my troubles would be ended speedily ; and though i could , perhaps , bear to die , i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached .
so i must have lain for hours , continually beaten to and fro upon the billows , now and again wetted with flying sprays , and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge .
gradually weariness grew upon me ; a numbness , an occasional stupor , fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors , until sleep at last supervened and in my seatossed coracle i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow .
it was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the southwest end of treasure island .
the sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spyglass , which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs .
haulbowline head and mizzenmast hill were at my elbow , the hill bare and dark , the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock .
i was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward , and it was my first thought to paddle in and land .
that notion was soon given over .
among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed ; loud reverberations , heavy sprays flying and falling , succeeded one another from second to second ; and i saw myself , if i ventured nearer , dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags .
nor was that all , for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports i beheld huge slimy monsterssoft snails , as it were , of incredible bignesstwo or three score of them together , making the rocks to echo with their barkings .
i have understood since that they were sea lions , and entirely harmless .
but the look of them , added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf , was more than enough to disgust me of that landingplace .
i felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils .
in the meantime i had a better chance , as i supposed , before me .
north of haulbowline head , the land runs in a long way , leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand .
to the north of that , again , there comes another capecape of the woods , as it was marked upon the chartburied in tall green pines , which descended to the margin of the sea .
i remembered what silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of treasure island , and seeing from my position that i was already under its influence , i preferred to leave haulbowline head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlierlooking cape of the woods .
there was a great , smooth swell upon the sea .
the wind blowing steady and gentle from the south , there was no contrariety between that and the current , and the billows rose and fell unbroken .
had it been otherwise , i must long ago have perished ; but as it was , it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride .
often , as i still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale , i would see a big blue summit heaving close above me ; yet the coracle would but bounce a little , dance as if on springs , and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird .
i began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling .
but even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle .
and i had hardly moved before the boat , giving up at once her gentle dancing movement , ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy , and struck her nose , with a spout of spray , deep into the side of the next wave .
i was drenched and terrified , and fell instantly back into my old position , whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows .
it was plain she was not to be interfered with , and at that rate , since i could in no way influence her course , what hope had i left of reaching land ?
i began to be horribly frightened , but i kept my head , for all that .
first , moving with all care , i gradually baled out the coracle with my seacap ; then , getting my eye once more above the gunwale , i set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers .
i found each wave , instead of the big , smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel's deck , was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land , full of peaks and smooth places and valleys .
the coracle , left to herself , turning from side to side , threaded , so to speak , her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher , toppling summits of the wave .
well , now , thought i to myself , it is plain i must lie where i am and not disturb the balance ; but it is plain also that i can put the paddle over the side and from time to time , in smooth places , give her a shove or two towards land .
no sooner thought upon than done .
there i lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude , and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore .
it was very tiring and slow work , yet i did visibly gain ground ; and as we drew near the cape of the woods , though i saw i must infallibly miss that point , i had still made some hundred yards of easting .
i was , indeed , close in .
i could see the cool green treetops swaying together in the breeze , and i felt sure i should make the next promontory without fail .
it was high time , for i now began to be tortured with thirst .
the glow of the sun from above , its thousandfold reflection from the waves , the seawater that fell and dried upon me , caking my very lips with salt , combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache .
the sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing , but the current had soon carried me past the point , and as the next reach of sea opened out , i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts .
right in front of me , not half a mile away , i beheld the hispaniola under sail .
i made sure , of course , that i should be taken ; but i was so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought , and long before i had come to a conclusion , surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing but stare and wonder .
the hispaniola was under her mainsail and two jibs , and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver .
when i first sighted her , all her sails were drawing ; she was lying a course about northwest , and i presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage .
presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward , so that i thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase .
at last , however , she fell right into the wind's eye , was taken dead aback , and stood there awhile helpless , with her sails shivering .
clumsy fellows , said i ; they must still be drunk as owls .
and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping .
meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack , sailed swiftly for a minute or so , and brought up once more dead in the wind's eye .
again and again was this repeated .
to and fro , up and down , north , south , east , and west , the hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes , and at each repetition ended as she had begun , with idly flapping canvas .
it became plain to me that nobody was steering .
and if so , where were the men ?
either they were dead drunk or had deserted her , i thought , and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain .
the current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate .
as for the latter's sailing , it was so wild and intermittent , and she hung each time so long in irons , that she certainly gained nothing , if she did not even lose .
if only i dared to sit up and paddle , i made sure that i could overhaul her .
the scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me , and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage .
up i got , was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray , but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself , with all my strength and caution , to paddle after the unsteered hispaniola .
once i shipped a sea so heavy that i had to stop and bail , with my heart fluttering like a bird , but gradually i got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves , with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face .
i was now gaining rapidly on the schooner ; i could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about , and still no soul appeared upon her decks .
i could not choose but suppose she was deserted .
if not , the men were lying drunk below , where i might batten them down , perhaps , and do what i chose with the ship .
for some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for mestanding still .
she headed nearly due south , yawing , of course , all the time .
each time she fell off , her sails partly filled , and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again .
i have said this was the worst thing possible for me , for helpless as she looked in this situation , with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck , she still continued to run away from me , not only with the speed of the current , but by the whole amount of her leeway , which was naturally great .
but now , at last , i had my chance .
the breeze fell for some seconds , very low , and the current gradually turning her , the hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern , with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day .
the mainsail hung drooped like a banner .
she was stockstill but for the current .
for the last little while i had even lost , but now redoubling my efforts , i began once more to overhaul the chase .
i was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap ; she filled on the port tack and was off again , stooping and skimming like a swallow .
my first impulse was one of despair , but my second was towards joy .
round she came , till she was broadside on to meround still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us .
i could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot .
immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle .
and then , of a sudden , i began to comprehend .
i had scarce time to thinkscarce time to act and save myself .
i was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next .
the bowsprit was over my head .
i sprang to my feet and leaped , stamping the coracle under water .
with one hand i caught the jibboom , while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace ; and as i still clung there panting , a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that i was left without retreat on the hispaniola .
i had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack , with a report like a gun .
the schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse , but next moment , the other sails still drawing , the jib flapped back again and hung idle .
this had nearly tossed me off into the sea ; and now i lost no time , crawled back along the bowsprit , and tumbled head foremost on the deck .
i was on the lee side of the forecastle , and the mainsail , which was still drawing , concealed from me a certain portion of the afterdeck .
not a soul was to be seen .
the planks , which had not been swabbed since the mutiny , bore the print of many feet , and an empty bottle , broken by the neck , tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers .
suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind .
the jibs behind me cracked aloud , the rudder slammed to , the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder , and at the same moment the mainboom swung inboard , the sheet groaning in the blocks , and showed me the lee afterdeck .
there were the two watchmen , sure enough : redcap on his back , as stiff as a handspike , with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips ; israel hands propped against the bulwarks , his chin on his chest , his hands lying open before him on the deck , his face as white , under its tan , as a tallow candle .
for a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse , the sails filling , now on one tack , now on another , and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain .
now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the swell ; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my homemade , lopsided coracle , now gone to the bottom of the sea .
at every jump of the schooner , redcap slipped to and fro , butwhat was ghastly to beholdneither his attitude nor his fixed teethdisclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage .
at every jump too , hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck , his feet sliding ever the farther out , and the whole body canting towards the stern , so that his face became , little by little , hid from me ; and at last i could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker .
at the same time , i observed , around both of them , splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath .
while i was thus looking and wondering , in a calm moment , when the ship was still , israel hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which i had seen him first .
the moan , which told of pain and deadly weakness , and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart .
but when i remembered the talk i had overheard from the apple barrel , all pity left me .
i walked aft until i reached the mainmast .
come aboard , mr. hands , i said ironically .
he rolled his eyes round heavily , but he was too far gone to express surprise .
all he could do was to utter one word , brandy .
it occurred to me there was no time to lose , and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck , i slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin .
it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy .
all the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart .
the floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp .
the bulkheads , all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt , bore a pattern of dirty hands .
dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship .
one of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table , half of the leaves gutted out , i suppose , for pipelights .
in the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow , obscure and brown as umber .
i went into the cellar ; all the barrels were gone , and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away .
certainly , since the mutiny began , not a man of them could ever have been sober .
foraging about , i found a bottle with some brandy left , for hands ; and for myself i routed out some biscuit , some pickled fruits , a great bunch of raisins , and a piece of cheese .
with these i came on deck , put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain's reach , went forward to the waterbreaker , and had a good deep drink of water , and then , and not till then , gave hands the brandy .
he must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth .
aye , said he , by thunder , but i wanted some o' that !
i had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat .
much hurt ?
i asked him .
he grunted , or rather , i might say , he barked .
if that doctor was aboard , he said , i'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but i don't have no manner of luck , you see , and that's what's the matter with me .
as for that swab , he's good and dead , he is , he added , indicating the man with the red cap .
he warn't no seaman anyhow .
and where mought you have come from ?
well , said i , i've come aboard to take possession of this ship , mr. hands ; and you'll please regard me as your captain until further notice .
he looked at me sourly enough but said nothing .
some of the colour had come back into his cheeks , though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about .
by the by , i continued , i can't have these colours , mr. hands ; and by your leave , i'll strike 'em .
better none than these .
and again dodging the boom , i ran to the colour lines , handed down their cursed black flag , and chucked it overboard .
god save the king !
said i , waving my cap .
and there's an end to captain silver !
he watched me keenly and slyly , his chin all the while on his breast .
i reckon , he said at last , i reckon , cap'n hawkins , you'll kind of want to get ashore now .
s'pose we talks .
why , yes , says i , with all my heart , mr. hands .
say on .
and i went back to my meal with a good appetite .
this man , he began , nodding feebly at the corpse o'brien were his name , a rank irelanderthis man and me got the canvas on her , meaning for to sail her back .
well , he's dead now , he isas dead as bilge ; and who's to sail this ship , i don't see .
without i gives you a hint , you ain't that man , as far's i can tell .
now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and i'll tell you how to sail her , and that's about square all round , i take it .
i'll tell you one thing , says i : i'm not going back to captain kidd's anchorage .
i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietly there .
to be sure you did , he cried .
why , i ain't sich an infernal lubber after all .
i can see , can't i ?
i've tried my fling , i have , and i've lost , and it's you has the wind of me .
north inlet ?
why , i haven't no ch'ice , not i !
i'd help you sail her up to execution dock , by thunder !
so i would .
well , as it seemed to me , there was some sense in this .
we struck our bargain on the spot .
in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island , with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as north inlet before high water , when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land .
then i lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest , where i got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother's .
with this , and with my aid , hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh , and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy , he began to pick up visibly , sat straighter up , spoke louder and clearer , and looked in every way another man .
the breeze served us admirably .
we skimmed before it like a bird , the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute .
soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low , sandy country , sparsely dotted with dwarf pines , and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north .
i was greatly elated with my new command , and pleased with the bright , sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast .
i had now plenty of water and good things to eat , and my conscience , which had smitten me hard for my desertion , was quieted by the great conquest i had made .
i should , i think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face .
it was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weaknessa haggard old man's smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work .
the wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west .
we could run so much the easier from the northeast corner of the island to the mouth of the north inlet .
only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands .
the coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a good many trials i succeeded , and we both sat in silence over another meal .
cap'n , said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile , here's my old shipmate , o'brien ; s'pose you was to heave him overboard .
i ain't partic'lar as a rule , and i don't take no blame for settling his hash , but i don't reckon him ornamental now , do you ?
i'm not strong enough , and i don't like the job ; and there he lies , for me , said i .
this here's an unlucky ship , this hispaniola , jim , he went on , blinking .
there's a power of men been killed in this hispaniolaa sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to bristol .
i never seen sich dirty luck , not i .
there was this here o'brien nowhe's dead , ain't he ?
well now , i'm no scholar , and you're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ?
you can kill the body , mr. hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , i replied .
o'brien there is in another world , and may be watching us .
ah !
says he .
well , that's unfort'nateappears as if killing parties was a waste of time .
howsomever , sperrits don't reckon for much , by what i've seen .
i'll chance it with the sperrits , jim .
and now , you've spoke up free , and i'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabin and get me awell , ashiver my timbers !
i can't hit the name on 't ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , jimthis here brandy's too strong for my head .
now , the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural , and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy , i entirely disbelieved it .
the whole story was a pretext .
he wanted me to leave the deckso much was plain ; but with what purpose i could in no way imagine .
his eyes never met mine ; they kept wandering to and fro , up and down , now with a look to the sky , now with a flitting glance upon the dead o'brien .
all the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty , embarrassed manner , so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception .
i was prompt with my answer , however , for i saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid i could easily conceal my suspicions to the end .
some wine ?
i said .
far better .
will you have white or red ?
well , i reckon it's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , he replied ; so it's strong , and plenty of it , what's the odds ?
all right , i answered .
i'll bring you port , mr. hands .
but i'll have to dig for it .
with that i scuttled down the companion with all the noise i could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion .
i knew he would not expect to see me there , yet i took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true .
he had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he movedfor i could hear him stifle a groanyet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck .
in half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood .
he looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark .
this was all that i required to know .
israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that i was meant to be the victim .
what he would do afterwardswhether he would try to crawl right across the island from north inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire long tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help himwas , of course , more than i could say .
yet i felt sure that i could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner .
we both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done i considered that my life would certainly be spared .
while i was thus turning the business over in my mind , i had not been idle with my body .
i had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , i made my reappearance on the deck .
hands lay as i had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light .
he looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of here's luck !
then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid .
cut me a junk o' that , says he , for i haven't no knife and hardly strength enough , so be as i had .
ah , jim , jim , i reckon i've missed stays !
cut me a quid , as'll likely be the last , lad , for i'm for my long home , and no mistake .
well , said i , i'll cut you some tobacco , but if i was you and thought myself so badly , i would go to my prayers like a christian man .
why ?
said he .
now , you tell me why .
why ?
i cried .
you were asking me just now about the dead .
you've broken your trust ; you've lived in sin and lies and blood ; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment , and you ask me why !
for god's mercy , mr. hands , that's why .
i spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with .
he , for his part , took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity .
for thirty years , he said , i've sailed the seas and seen good and bad , better and worse , fair weather and foul , provisions running out , knives going , and what not .
well , now i tell you , i never seen good come o' goodness yet .
him as strikes first is my fancy ; dead men don't bite ; them's my viewsamen , so be it .
and now , you look here , he added , suddenly changing his tone , we've had about enough of this foolery .
the tide's made good enough by now .
you just take my orders , cap'n hawkins , and we'll sail slap in and be done with it .
all told , we had scarce two miles to run ; but the navigation was delicate , the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal , but lay east and west , so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in .
i think i was a good , prompt subaltern , and i am very sure that hands was an excellent pilot , for we went about and about and dodged in , shaving the banks , with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold .
scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us .
the shores of north inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage , but the space was longer and narrower and more like , what in truth it was , the estuary of a river .
right before us , at the southern end , we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation .
it had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed , and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers .
it was a sad sight , but it showed us that the anchorage was calm .
now , said hands , look there ; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship in .
fine flat sand , never a cat's paw , trees all around of it , and flowers ablowing like a garding on that old ship .
and once beached , i inquired , how shall we get her off again ?
why , so , he replied : you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water , take a turn about one of them big pines ; bring it back , take a turn around the capstan , and lie to for the tide .
come high water , all hands take a pull upon the line , and off she comes as sweet as natur' .
and now , boy , you stand by .
we're near the bit now , and she's too much way on her .
starboard a littlesosteadystarboardlarboard a littlesteadysteady !
so he issued his commands , which i breathlessly obeyed , till , all of a sudden , he cried , now , my hearty , luff !
and i put the helm hard up , and the hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low , wooded shore .
the excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch i had kept hitherto , sharply enough , upon the coxswain .
even then i was still so much interested , waiting for the ship to touch , that i had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows .
i might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head .
perhaps i had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye ; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's ; but , sure enough , when i looked round , there was hands , already halfway towards me , with the dirk in his right hand .
we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully's .
at the same instant , he threw himself forward and i leapt sideways towards the bows .
as i did so , i let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and i think this saved my life , for it struck hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment , dead .
before he could recover , i was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped , with all the deck to dodge about .
just forward of the mainmast i stopped , drew a pistol from my pocket , took a cool aim , though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me , and drew the trigger .
the hammer fell , but there followed neither flash nor sound ; the priming was useless with seawater .
i cursed myself for my neglect .
why had not i , long before , reprimed and reloaded my only weapons ?
then i should not have been as now , a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher .
wounded as he was , it was wonderful how fast he could move , his grizzled hair tumbling over his face , and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury .
i had no time to try my other pistol , nor indeed much inclination , for i was sure it would be useless .
one thing i saw plainly : i must not simply retreat before him , or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows , as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern .
once so caught , and nine or ten inches of the bloodstained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity .
i placed my palms against the mainmast , which was of a goodish bigness , and waited , every nerve upon the stretch .
seeing that i meant to dodge , he also paused ; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine .
it was such a game as i had often played at home about the rocks of black hill cove , but never before , you may be sure , with such a wildly beating heart as now .
still , as i say , it was a boy's game , and i thought i could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh .
indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that i allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair , and while i saw certainly that i could spin it out for long , i saw no hope of any ultimate escape .
well , while things stood thus , suddenly the hispaniola struck , staggered , ground for an instant in the sand , and then , swift as a blow , canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of fortyfive degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay , in a pool , between the deck and bulwark .
we were both of us capsized in a second , and both of us rolled , almost together , into the scuppers , the dead redcap , with his arms still spread out , tumbling stiffly after us .
so near were we , indeed , that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle .
blow and all , i was the first afoot again , for hands had got involved with the dead body .
the sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on ; i had to find some new way of escape , and that upon the instant , for my foe was almost touching me .
quick as thought , i sprang into the mizzen shrouds , rattled up hand over hand , and did not draw a breath till i was seated on the crosstrees .
i had been saved by being prompt ; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as i pursued my upward flight ; and there stood israel hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine , a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment .
now that i had a moment to myself , i lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol , and then , having one ready for service , and to make assurance doubly sure , i proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning .
my new employment struck hands all of a heap ; he began to see the dice going against him , and after an obvious hesitation , he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds , and with the dirk in his teeth , began slowly and painfully to mount .
it cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him , and i had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up .
then , with a pistol in either hand , i addressed him .
one more step , mr. hands , said i , and i'll blow your brains out !
dead men don't bite , you know , i added with a chuckle .
he stopped instantly .
i could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think , and the process was so slow and laborious that , in my newfound security , i laughed aloud .
at last , with a swallow or two , he spoke , his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity .
in order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth , but in all else he remained unmoved .
jim , says he , i reckon we're fouled , you and me , and we'll have to sign articles .
i'd have had you but for that there lurch , but i don't have no luck , not i ; and i reckon i'll have to strike , which comes hard , you see , for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you , jim .
i was drinking in his words and smiling away , as conceited as a cock upon a wall , when , all in a breath , back went his right hand over his shoulder .
something sang like an arrow through the air ; i felt a blow and then a sharp pang , and there i was pinned by the shoulder to the mast .
in the horrid pain and surprise of the momenti scarce can say it was by my own volition , and i am sure it was without a conscious aimboth my pistols went off , and both escaped out of my hands .
they did not fall alone ; with a choked cry , the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water .
owing to the cant of the vessel , the masts hung far out over the water , and from my perch on the crosstrees i had nothing below me but the surface of the bay .
hands , who was not so far up , was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks .
he rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good .
as the water settled , i could see him lying huddled together on the clean , bright sand in the shadow of the vessel's sides .
a fish or two whipped past his body .
sometimes , by the quivering of the water , he appeared to move a little , as if he were trying to rise .
but he was dead enough , for all that , being both shot and drowned , and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter .
i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick , faint , and terrified .
the hot blood was running over my back and chest .
the dirk , where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast , seemed to burn like a hot iron ; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me , for these , it seemed to me , i could bear without a murmur ; it was the horror i had upon my mind of falling from the crosstrees into that still green water , beside the body of the coxswain .
i clung with both hands till my nails ached , and i shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril .
gradually my mind came back again , my pulses quieted down to a more natural time , and i was once more in possession of myself .
it was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk , but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me , and i desisted with a violent shudder .
oddly enough , that very shudder did the business .
the knife , in fact , had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether ; it held me by a mere pinch of skin , and this the shudder tore away .
the blood ran down the faster , to be sure , but i was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt .
these last i broke through with a sudden jerk , and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds .
for nothing in the world would i have again ventured , shaken as i was , upon the overhanging port shrouds from which israel had so lately fallen .
i went below and did what i could for my wound ; it pained me a good deal and still bled freely , but it was neither deep nor dangerous , nor did it greatly gall me when i used my arm .
then i looked around me , and as the ship was now , in a sense , my own , i began to think of clearing it from its last passengerthe dead man , o'brien .
he had pitched , as i have said , against the bulwarks , where he lay like some horrible , ungainly sort of puppet , lifesize , indeed , but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness !
in that position i could easily have my way with him , and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead , i took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave , tumbled him overboard .
he went in with a sounding plunge ; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface ; and as soon as the splash subsided , i could see him and israel lying side by side , both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water .
o'brien , though still quite a young man , was very bald .
there he lay , with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both .
i was now alone upon the ship ; the tide had just turned .
the sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck .
the evening breeze had sprung up , and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east , the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro .
i began to see a danger to the ship .
the jibs i speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck , but the mainsail was a harder matter .
of course , when the schooner canted over , the boom had swung outboard , and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water .
i thought this made it still more dangerous ; yet the strain was so heavy that i half feared to meddle .
at last i got my knife and cut the halyards .
the peak dropped instantly , a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water , and since , pull as i liked , i could not budge the downhall , that was the extent of what i could accomplish .
for the rest , the hispaniola must trust to luck , like myself .
by this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadowthe last rays , i remember , falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck .
it began to be chill ; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward , the schooner settling more and more on her beamends .
i scrambled forward and looked over .
it seemed shallow enough , and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security , i let myself drop softly overboard .
the water scarcely reached my waist ; the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks , and i waded ashore in great spirits , leaving the hispaniola on her side , with her mainsail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay .
about the same time , the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines .
at least , and at last , i was off the sea , nor had i returned thence emptyhanded .
there lay the schooner , clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again .
i had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements .
possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry , but the recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer , and i hoped that even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time .
so thinking , and in famous spirits , i began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions .
i remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into captain kidd's anchorage ran from the twopeaked hill upon my left , and i bent my course in that direction that i might pass the stream while it was small .
the wood was pretty open , and keeping along the lower spurs , i had soon turned the corner of that hill , and not long after waded to the midcalf across the watercourse .
this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn , the maroon ; and i walked more circumspectly , keeping an eye on every side .
the dusk had come nigh hand completely , and as i opened out the cleft between the two peaks , i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky , where , as i judged , the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire .
and yet i wondered , in my heart , that he should show himself so careless .
for if i could see this radiance , might it not reach the eyes of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes ?
gradually the night fell blacker ; it was all i could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination ; the double hill behind me and the spyglass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter ; the stars were few and pale ; and in the low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits .
suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me .
i looked up ; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the spyglass , and soon after i saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees , and knew the moon had risen .
with this to help me , i passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey , and sometimes walking , sometimes running , impatiently drew near to the stockade .
yet , as i began to thread the grove that lies before it , i was not so thoughtless but that i slacked my pace and went a trifle warily .
it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake .
the moon was climbing higher and higher , its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood , and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees .
it was red and hot , and now and again it was a little darkenedas it were , the embers of a bonfire smouldering .
for the life of me i could not think what it might be .
at last i came right down upon the borders of the clearing .
the western end was already steeped in moonshine ; the rest , and the block house itself , still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light .
on the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon .
there was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze .
i stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also .
it had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain's orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and i began to fear that something had gone wrong while i was absent .
i stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade .
to make assurance surer , i got upon my hands and knees and crawled , without a sound , towards the corner of the house .
as i drew nearer , my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened .
it is not a pleasant noise in itself , and i have often complained of it at other times , but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep .
the seacry of the watch , that beautiful all's well , never fell more reassuringly on my ear .
in the meantime , there was no doubt of one thing ; they kept an infamous bad watch .
if it had been silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them , not a soul would have seen daybreak .
that was what it was , thought i , to have the captain wounded ; and again i blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard .
by this time i had got to the door and stood up .
all was dark within , so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye .
as for sounds , there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise , a flickering or pecking that i could in no way account for .
with my arms before me i walked steadily in .
i should lie down in my own place i thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning .
my foot struck something yieldingit was a sleeper's leg ; and he turned and groaned , but without awaking .
and then , all of a sudden , a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness : pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
and so forth , without pause or change , like the clacking of a tiny mill .
silver's green parrot , captain flint !
it was she whom i had heard pecking at a piece of bark ; it was she , keeping better watch than any human being , who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain .
i had no time left me to recover .
at the sharp , clipping tone of the parrot , the sleepers awoke and sprang up ; and with a mighty oath , the voice of silver cried , who goes ?
i turned to run , struck violently against one person , recoiled , and ran full into the arms of a second , who for his part closed upon and held me tight .
bring a torch , dick , said silver when my capture was thus assured .
and one of the men left the loghouse and presently returned with a lighted brand .
the red glare of the torch , lighting up the interior of the block house , showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized .
the pirates were in possession of the house and stores : there was the cask of cognac , there were the pork and bread , as before , and what tenfold increased my horror , not a sign of any prisoner .
i could only judge that all had perished , and my heart smote me sorely that i had not been there to perish with them .
there were six of the buccaneers , all told ; not another man was left alive .
five of them were on their feet , flushed and swollen , suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness .
the sixth had only risen upon his elbow ; he was deadly pale , and the bloodstained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded , and still more recently dressed .
i remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack , and doubted not that this was he .
the parrot sat , preening her plumage , on long john's shoulder .
he himself , i thought , looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used to .
he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission , but it was bitterly the worse for wear , daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood .
so , said he , here's jim hawkins , shiver my timbers !
dropped in , like , eh ?
well , come , i take that friendly .
and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe .
give me a loan of the link , dick , said he ; and then , when he had a good light , that'll do , lad , he added ; stick the glim in the wood heap ; and you , gentlemen , bring yourselves to !
you needn't stand up for mr. hawkins ; he'll excuse you , you may lay to that .
and so , jimstopping the tobaccohere you were , and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old john .
i see you were smart when first i set my eyes on you , but this here gets away from me clean , it do .
to all this , as may be well supposed , i made no answer .
they had set me with my back against the wall , and i stood there , looking silver in the face , pluckily enough , i hope , to all outward appearance , but with black despair in my heart .
silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again .
now , you see , jim , so be as you are here , says he , i'll give you a piece of my mind .
i've always liked you , i have , for a lad of spirit , and the picter of my own self when i was young and handsome .
i always wanted you to jine and take your share , and die a gentleman , and now , my cock , you've got to .
cap'n smollett's a fine seaman , as i'll own up to any day , but stiff on discipline .
'dooty is dooty ,' says he , and right he is .
just you keep clear of the cap'n .
the doctor himself is gone dead again you'ungrateful scamp' was what he said ; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here : you can't go back to your own lot , for they won't have you ; and without you start a third ship's company all by yourself , which might be lonely , you'll have to jine with cap'n silver .
so far so good .
my friends , then , were still alive , and though i partly believed the truth of silver's statement , that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion , i was more relieved than distressed by what i heard .
i don't say nothing as to your being in our hands , continued silver , though there you are , and you may lay to it .
i'm all for argyment ; i never seen good come out o' threatening .
if you like the service , well , you'll jine ; and if you don't , jim , why , you're free to answer nofree and welcome , shipmate ; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman , shiver my sides !
am i to answer , then ?
i asked with a very tremulous voice .
through all this sneering talk , i was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me , and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast .
lad , said silver , no one's apressing of you .
take your bearings .
none of us won't hurry you , mate ; time goes so pleasant in your company , you see .
well , says i , growing a bit bolder , if i'm to choose , i declare i have a right to know what's what , and why you're here , and where my friends are .
wot's wot ?
repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl .
ah , he'd be a lucky one as knowed that !
you'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to , my friend , cried silver truculently to this speaker .
and then , in his first gracious tones , he replied to me , yesterday morning , mr. hawkins , said he , in the dogwatch , down came doctor livesey with a flag of truce .
says he , 'cap'n silver , you're sold out .
ship's gone .
'well , maybe we'd been taking a glass , and a song to help it round .
i won't say no .
leastways , none of us had looked out .
we looked out , and by thunder , the old ship was gone !
i never seen a pack o' fools look fishier ; and you may lay to that , if i tells you that looked the fishiest .
'well ,' says the doctor , 'let's bargain .
'we bargained , him and i , and here we are : stores , brandy , block house , the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut , and in a manner of speaking , the whole blessed boat , from crosstrees to kelson .
as for them , they've tramped ; i don't know where's they are .
he drew again quietly at his pipe .
and lest you should take it into that head of yours , he went on , that you was included in the treaty , here's the last word that was said : 'how many are you ,' says i , 'to leave ?
''four ,' says he ; 'four , and one of us wounded .
as for that boy , i don't know where he is , confound him ,' says he , 'nor i don't much care .
we're about sick of him .
'these was his words .
is that all ?
i asked .
well , it's all that you're to hear , my son , returned silver .
and now i am to choose ?
and now you are to choose , and you may lay to that , said silver .
well , said i , i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have to look for .
let the worst come to the worst , it's little i care .
i've seen too many die since i fell in with you .
but there's a thing or two i have to tell you , i said , and by this time i was quite excited ; and the first is this : here you are , in a bad wayship lost , treasure lost , men lost , your whole business gone to wreck ; and if you want to know who did itit was i !
i was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land , and i heard you , john , and you , dick johnson , and hands , who is now at the bottom of the sea , and told every word you said before the hour was out .
and as for the schooner , it was i who cut her cable , and it was i that killed the men you had aboard of her , and it was i who brought her where you'll never see her more , not one of you .
the laugh's on my side ; i've had the top of this business from the first ; i no more fear you than i fear a fly .
kill me , if you please , or spare me .
but one thing i'll say , and no more ; if you spare me , bygones are bygones , and when you fellows are in court for piracy , i'll save you all i can .
it is for you to choose .
kill another and do yourselves no good , or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows .
i stopped , for , i tell you , i was out of breath , and to my wonder , not a man of them moved , but all sat staring at me like as many sheep .
and while they were still staring , i broke out again , and now , mr. silver , i said , i believe you're the best man here , and if things go to the worst , i'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took it .
i'll bear it in mind , said silver with an accent so curious that i could not , for the life of me , decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage .
i'll put one to that , cried the old mahoganyfaced seamanmorgan by namewhom i had seen in long john's publichouse upon the quays of bristol .
it was him that knowed black dog .
well , and see here , added the seacook .
i'll put another again to that , by thunder !
for it was this same boy that faked the chart from billy bones .
first and last , we've split upon jim hawkins !
then here goes !
said morgan with an oath .
and he sprang up , drawing his knife as if he had been twenty .
avast , there !
cried silver .
who are you , tom morgan ?
maybe you thought you was cap'n here , perhaps .
by the powers , but i'll teach you better !
cross me , and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you , first and last , these thirty year backsome to the yardarm , shiver my timbers , and some by the board , and all to feed the fishes .
there's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards , tom morgan , you may lay to that .
morgan paused , but a hoarse murmur rose from the others .
tom's right , said one .
i stood hazing long enough from one , added another .
i'll be hanged if i'll be hazed by you , john silver .
did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me ?
roared silver , bending far forward from his position on the keg , with his pipe still glowing in his right hand .
put a name on what you're at ; you ain't dumb , i reckon .
him that wants shall get it .
have i lived this many years , and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it ?
you know the way ; you're all gentlemen o' fortune , by your account .
well , i'm ready .
take a cutlass , him that dares , and i'll see the colour of his inside , crutch and all , before that pipe's empty .
not a man stirred ; not a man answered .
that's your sort , is it ?
he added , returning his pipe to his mouth .
well , you're a gay lot to look at , anyway .
not much worth to fight , you ain't .
p'r'aps you can understand king george's english .
i'm cap'n here by 'lection .
i'm cap'n here because i'm the best man by a long seamile .
you won't fight , as gentlemen o' fortune should ; then , by thunder , you'll obey , and you may lay to it !
i like that boy , now ; i never seen a better boy than that .
he's more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house , and what i say is this : let me see him that'll lay a hand on himthat's what i say , and you may lay to it .
there was a long pause after this .
i stood straight up against the wall , my heart still going like a sledgehammer , but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom .
silver leant back against the wall , his arms crossed , his pipe in the corner of his mouth , as calm as though he had been in church ; yet his eye kept wandering furtively , and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers .
they , on their part , drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house , and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously , like a stream .
one after another , they would look up , and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces ; but it was not towards me , it was towards silver that they turned their eyes .
you seem to have a lot to say , remarked silver , spitting far into the air .
pipe up and let me hear it , or lay to .
ax your pardon , sir , returned one of the men ; you're pretty free with some of the rules ; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon the rest .
this crew's dissatisfied ; this crew don't vally bullying a marlinspike ; this crew has its rights like other crews , i'll make so free as that ; and by your own rules , i take it we can talk together .
i ax your pardon , sir , acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present ; but i claim my right , and steps outside for a council .
and with an elaborate seasalute , this fellow , a long , illlooking , yelloweyed man of five and thirty , stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house .
one after another the rest followed his example , each making a salute as he passed , each adding some apology .
according to rules , said one .
forecastle council , said morgan .
and so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me alone with the torch .
the seacook instantly removed his pipe .
now , look you here , jim hawkins , he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible , you're within half a plank of death , and what's a long sight worse , of torture .
they're going to throw me off .
but , you mark , i stand by you through thick and thin .
i didn't mean to ; no , not till you spoke up .
i was about desperate to lose that much blunt , and be hanged into the bargain .
but i see you was the right sort .
i says to myself , you stand by hawkins , john , and hawkins'll stand by you .
you're his last card , and by the living thunder , john , he's yours !
back to back , says i .
you save your witness , and he'll save your neck !
i began dimly to understand .
you mean all's lost ?
i asked .
aye , by gum , i do !
he answered .
ship gone , neck gonethat's the size of it .
once i looked into that bay , jim hawkins , and seen no schoonerwell , i'm tough , but i gave out .
as for that lot and their council , mark me , they're outright fools and cowards .
i'll save your lifeif so be as i canfrom them .
but , see here , jimtit for tatyou save long john from swinging .
i was bewildered ; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was askinghe , the old buccaneer , the ringleader throughout .
what i can do , that i'll do , i said .
it's a bargain !
cried long john .
you speak up plucky , and by thunder , i've a chance !
he hobbled to the torch , where it stood propped among the firewood , and took a fresh light to his pipe .
understand me , jim , he said , returning .
i've a head on my shoulders , i have .
i'm on squire's side now .
i know you've got that ship safe somewheres .
how you done it , i don't know , but safe it is .
i guess hands and o'brien turned soft .
i never much believed in neither of them .
now you mark me .
i ask no questions , nor i won't let others .
i know when a game's up , i do ; and i know a lad that's staunch .
ah , you that's youngyou and me might have done a power of good together !
he drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin .
will you taste , messmate ?
he asked ; and when i had refused : well , i'll take a dram myself , jim , said he .
i need a caulker , for there's trouble on hand .
and talking o' trouble , why did that doctor give me the chart , jim ?
my face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions .
ah , well , he did , though , said he .
and there's something under that , no doubtsomething , surely , under that , jimbad or good .
and he took another swallow of the brandy , shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst .
the council of buccaneers had lasted some time , when one of them reentered the house , and with a repetition of the same salute , which had in my eyes an ironical air , begged for a moment's loan of the torch .
silver briefly agreed , and this emissary retired again , leaving us together in the dark .
there's a breeze coming , jim , said silver , who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone .
i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out .
the embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch .
about halfway down the slope to the stockade , they were collected in a group ; one held the light , another was on his knees in their midst , and i saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight .
the rest were all somewhat stooping , as though watching the manoeuvres of this last .
i could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand , and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house .
here they come , said i ; and i returned to my former position , for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them .
well , let 'em come , ladlet 'em come , said silver cheerily .
i've still a shot in my locker .
the door opened , and the five men , standing huddled together just inside , pushed one of their number forward .
in any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance , hesitating as he set down each foot , but holding his closed right hand in front of him .
step up , lad , cried silver .
i won't eat you .
hand it over , lubber .
i know the rules , i do ; i won't hurt a depytation .
thus encouraged , the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly , and having passed something to silver , from hand to hand , slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions .
the seacook looked at what had been given him .
the black spot !
i thought so , he observed .
where might you have got the paper ?
why , hillo !
look here , now ; this ain't lucky !
you've gone and cut this out of a bible .
what fool's cut a bible ?
ah , there !
said morgan .
there !
wot did i say ?
no good'll come o' that , i said .
well , you've about fixed it now , among you , continued silver .
you'll all swing now , i reckon .
what softheaded lubber had a bible ?
it was dick , said one .
dick , was it ?
then dick can get to prayers , said silver .
he's seen his slice of luck , has dick , and you may lay to that .
but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in .
belay that talk , john silver , he said .
this crew has tipped you the black spot in full council , as in dooty bound ; just you turn it over , as in dooty bound , and see what's wrote there .
then you can talk .
thanky , george , replied the seacook .
you always was brisk for business , and has the rules by heart , george , as i'm pleased to see .
well , what is it , anyway ?
ah !
'deposed'that's it , is it ?
very pretty wrote , to be sure ; like print , i swear .
your hand o' write , george ?
why , you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew .
you'll be cap'n next , i shouldn't wonder .
just oblige me with that torch again , will you ?
this pipe don't draw .
come , now , said george , you don't fool this crew no more .
you're a funny man , by your account ; but you're over now , and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote .
i thought you said you knowed the rules , returned silver contemptuously .
leastways , if you don't , i do ; and i wait hereand i'm still your cap'n , mindtill you outs with your grievances and i reply ; in the meantime , your black spot ain't worth a biscuit .
after that , we'll see .
oh , replied george , you don't be under no kind of apprehension ; we're all square , we are .
first , you've made a hash of this cruiseyou'll be a bold man to say no to that .
second , you let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing .
why did they want out ?
i dunno , but it's pretty plain they wanted it .
third , you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march .
oh , we see through you , john silver ; you want to play booty , that's what's wrong with you .
and then , fourth , there's this here boy .
is that all ?
asked silver quietly .
enough , too , retorted george .
we'll all swing and sundry for your bungling .
well now , look here , i'll answer these four p'ints ; one after another i'll answer 'em .
i made a hash o' this cruise , did i ?
well now , you all know what i wanted , and you all know if that had been done that we'd 'a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was , every man of us alive , and fit , and full of good plumduff , and the treasure in the hold of her , by thunder !
well , who crossed me ?
who forced my hand , as was the lawful cap'n ?
who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ?
ah , it's a fine dancei'm with you thereand looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope's end at execution dock by london town , it does .
but who done it ?
why , it was anderson , and hands , and you , george merry !
and you're the last above board of that same meddling crew ; and you have the davy jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over meyou , that sank the lot of us !
by the powers !
but this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing .
silver paused , and i could see by the faces of george and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain .
that's for number one , cried the accused , wiping the sweat from his brow , for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house .
why , i give you my word , i'm sick to speak to you .
you've neither sense nor memory , and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea .
sea !
gentlemen o' fortune !
i reckon tailors is your trade .
go on , john , said morgan .
speak up to the others .
ah , the others !
returned john .
they're a nice lot , ain't they ?
you say this cruise is bungled .
ah !
by gum , if you could understand how bad it's bungled , you would see !
we're that near the gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it .
you've seen 'em , maybe , hanged in chains , birds about 'em , seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide .
'who's that ?
'says one .
'that !
why , that's john silver .
i knowed him well ,' says another .
and you can hear the chains ajangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy .
now , that's about where we are , every mother's son of us , thanks to him , and hands , and anderson , and other ruination fools of you .
and if you want to know about number four , and that boy , why , shiver my timbers , isn't he a hostage ?
are we agoing to waste a hostage ?
no , not us ; he might be our last chance , and i shouldn't wonder .
kill that boy ?
not me , mates !
and number three ?
ah , well , there's a deal to say to number three .
maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every dayyou , john , with your head brokeor you , george merry , that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone , and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock ?
and maybe , perhaps , you didn't know there was a consort coming either ?
but there is , and not so long till then ; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that .
and as for number two , and why i made a bargainwell , you came crawling on your knees to me to make iton your knees you came , you was that downheartedand you'd have starved too if i hadn'tbut that's a trifle !
you look therethat's why !
and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly recognizednone other than the chart on yellow paper , with the three red crosses , that i had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain's chest .
why the doctor had given it to him was more than i could fancy .
but if it were inexplicable to me , the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers .
they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse .
it went from hand to hand , one tearing it from another ; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination , you would have thought , not only they were fingering the very gold , but were at sea with it , besides , in safety .
yes , said one , that's flint , sure enough .
j .
f .
 ,and a score below , with a clove hitch to it ; so he done ever .
mighty pretty , said george .
but how are we to get away with it , and us no ship .
silver suddenly sprang up , and supporting himself with a hand against the wall : now i give you warning , george , he cried .
one more word of your sauce , and i'll call you down and fight you .
how ?
why , how do i know ?
you had ought to tell me thatyou and the rest , that lost me my schooner , with your interference , burn you !
but not you , you can't ; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach .
but civil you can speak , and shall , george merry , you may lay to that .
that's fair enow , said the old man morgan .
fair !
i reckon so , said the seacook .
you lost the ship ; i found the treasure .
who's the better man at that ?
and now i resign , by thunder !
elect whom you please to be your cap'n now ; i'm done with it .
silver !
they cried .
barbecue forever !
barbecue for cap'n !
so that's the toon , is it ?
cried the cook .
george , i reckon you'll have to wait another turn , friend ; and lucky for you as i'm not a revengeful man .
but that was never my way .
and now , shipmates , this black spot ?
'tain't much good now , is it ?
dick's crossed his luck and spoiled his bible , and that's about all .
it'll do to kiss the book on still , won't it ?
growled dick , who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself .
a bible with a bit cut out !
returned silver derisively .
not it .
it don't bind no more'n a balladbook .
don't it , though ?
cried dick with a sort of joy .
well , i reckon that's worth having too .
here , jimhere's a cur'osity for you , said silver , and he tossed me the paper .
it was around about the size of a crown piece .
one side was blank , for it had been the last leaf ; the other contained a verse or two of revelationthese words among the rest , which struck sharply home upon my mind : without are dogs and murderers .
the printed side had been blackened with wood ash , which already began to come off and soil my fingers ; on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed .
i have that curiosity beside me at this moment , but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch , such as a man might make with his thumbnail .
that was the end of the night's business .
soon after , with a drink all round , we lay down to sleep , and the outside of silver's vengeance was to put george merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful .
it was long ere i could close an eye , and heaven knows i had matter enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon , in my own most perilous position , and above all , in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged uponkeeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means , possible and impossible , to make his peace and save his miserable life .
he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud , yet my heart was sore for him , wicked as he was , to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him .
i was wakenedindeed , we were all wakened , for i could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the doorpostby a clear , hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood : block house , ahoy !
it cried .
here's the doctor .
and the doctor it was .
although i was glad to hear the sound , yet my gladness was not without admixture .
i remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct , and when i saw where it had brought meamong what companions and surrounded by what dangersi felt ashamed to look him in the face .
he must have risen in the dark , for the day had hardly come ; and when i ran to a loophole and looked out , i saw him standing , like silver once before , up to the midleg in creeping vapour .
you , doctor !
top o' the morning to you , sir !
cried silver , broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment .
bright and early , to be sure ; and it's the early bird , as the saying goes , that gets the rations .
george , shake up your timbers , son , and help dr .
livesey over the ship's side .
all adoin' well , your patients wasall well and merry .
so he pattered on , standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the loghousequite the old john in voice , manner , and expression .
we've quite a surprise for you too , sir , he continued .
we've a little stranger herehe !
he !
a noo boarder and lodger , sir , and looking fit and taut as a fiddle ; slep' like a supercargo , he did , right alongside of johnstem to stem we was , all night .
dr .
livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook , and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said , not jim ?
the very same jim as ever was , says silver .
the doctor stopped outright , although he did not speak , and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on .
well , well , he said at last , duty first and pleasure afterwards , as you might have said yourself , silver .
let us overhaul these patients of yours .
a moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick .
he seemed under no apprehension , though he must have known that his life , among these treacherous demons , depended on a hair ; and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet english family .
his manner , i suppose , reacted on the men , for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred , as if he were still ship's doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast .
you're doing well , my friend , he said to the fellow with the bandaged head , and if ever any person had a close shave , it was you ; your head must be as hard as iron .
well , george , how goes it ?
you're a pretty colour , certainly ; why , your liver , man , is upside down .
did you take that medicine ?
did he take that medicine , men ?
aye , aye , sir , he took it , sure enough , returned morgan .
because , you see , since i am mutineers' doctor , or prison doctor as i prefer to call it , says doctor livesey in his pleasantest way , i make it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george god bless him !
and the gallows .
the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the homethrust in silence .
dick don't feel well , sir , said one .
don't he ?
replied the doctor .
well , step up here , dick , and let me see your tongue .
no , i should be surprised if he did !
the man's tongue is fit to frighten the french .
another fever .
ah , there , said morgan , that comed of sp'iling bibles .
that comesas you call itof being arrant asses , retorted the doctor , and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison , and the dry land from a vile , pestiferous slough .
i think it most probablethough of course it's only an opinionthat you'll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems .
camp in a bog , would you ?
silver , i'm surprised at you .
you're less of a fool than many , take you all round ; but you don't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health .
well , he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions , with really laughable humility , more like charity schoolchildren than bloodguilty mutineers and pirateswell , that's done for today .
and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy , please .
and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly .
george merry was at the door , spitting and spluttering over some badtasted medicine ; but at the first word of the doctor's proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried no !
and swore .
silver struck the barrel with his open hand .
silence !
he roared and looked about him positively like a lion .
doctor , he went on in his usual tones , i was athinking of that , knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy .
we're all humbly grateful for your kindness , and as you see , puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog .
and i take it i've found a way as'll suit all .
hawkins , will you give me your word of honour as a young gentlemanfor a young gentleman you are , although poor bornyour word of honour not to slip your cable ?
i readily gave the pledge required .
then , doctor , said silver , you just step outside o' that stockade , and once you're there i'll bring the boy down on the inside , and i reckon you can yarn through the spars .
good day to you , sir , and all our dooties to the squire and cap'n smollett .
the explosion of disapproval , which nothing but silver's black looks had restrained , broke out immediately the doctor had left the house .
silver was roundly accused of playing doubleof trying to make a separate peace for himself , of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims , and , in one word , of the identical , exact thing that he was doing .
it seemed to me so obvious , in this case , that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger .
but he was twice the man the rest were , and his last night's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds .
he called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine , said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor , fluttered the chart in their faces , asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound atreasurehunting .
no , by thunder !
he cried .
it's us must break the treaty when the time comes ; and till then i'll gammon that doctor , if i have to ile his boots with brandy .
and then he bade them get the fire lit , and stalked out upon his crutch , with his hand on my shoulder , leaving them in a disarray , and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced .
slow , lad , slow , he said .
they might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry .
very deliberately , then , did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade , and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance silver stopped .
you'll make a note of this here also , doctor , says he , and the boy'll tell you how i saved his life , and were deposed for it too , and you may lay to that .
doctor , when a man's steering as near the wind as meplaying chuckfarthing with the last breath in his body , likeyou wouldn't think it too much , mayhap , to give him one good word ?
you'll please bear in mind it's not my life only nowit's that boy's into the bargain ; and you'll speak me fair , doctor , and give me a bit o' hope to go on , for the sake of mercy .
silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house ; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in , his voice trembled ; never was a soul more dead in earnest .
why , john , you're not afraid ?
asked dr .
livesey .
doctor , i'm no coward ; no , not inot so much !
and he snapped his fingers .
if i was i wouldn't say it .
but i'll own up fairly , i've the shakes upon me for the gallows .
you're a good man and a true ; i never seen a better man !
and you'll not forget what i done good , not any more than you'll forget the bad , i know .
and i step asidesee hereand leave you and jim alone .
and you'll put that down for me too , for it's a long stretch , is that !
so saying , he stepped back a little way , till he was out of earshot , and there sat down upon a treestump and began to whistle , spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight , sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the firewhich they were busy rekindlingand the house , from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast .
so , jim , said the doctor sadly , here you are .
as you have brewed , so shall you drink , my boy .
heaven knows , i cannot find it in my heart to blame you , but this much i will say , be it kind or unkind : when captain smollett was well , you dared not have gone off ; and when he was ill and couldn't help it , by george , it was downright cowardly !
i will own that i here began to weep .
doctor , i said , you might spare me .
i have blamed myself enough ; my life's forfeit anyway , and i should have been dead by now if silver hadn't stood for me ; and doctor , believe this , i can dieand i dare say i deserve itbut what i fear is torture .
if they come to torture me jim , the doctor interrupted , and his voice was quite changed , jim , i can't have this .
whip over , and we'll run for it .
doctor , said i , i passed my word .
i know , i know , he cried .
we can't help that , jim , now .
i'll take it on my shoulders , holus bolus , blame and shame , my boy ; but stay here , i cannot let you .
jump !
one jump , and you're out , and we'll run for it like antelopes .
no , i replied ; you know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourselfneither you nor squire nor captain ; and no more will i .
silver trusted me ; i passed my word , and back i go .
but , doctor , you did not let me finish .
if they come to torture me , i might let slip a word of where the ship is , for i got the ship , part by luck and part by risking , and she lies in north inlet , on the southern beach , and just below high water .
at half tide she must be high and dry .
the ship !
exclaimed the doctor .
rapidly i described to him my adventures , and he heard me out in silence .
there is a kind of fate in this , he observed when i had done .
every step , it's you that saves our lives ; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours ?
that would be a poor return , my boy .
you found out the plot ; you found ben gunnthe best deed that ever you did , or will do , though you live to ninety .
oh , by jupiter , and talking of ben gunn !
why , this is the mischief in person .
silver !
he cried .
silver !
i'll give you a piece of advice , he continued as the cook drew near again ; don't you be in any great hurry after that treasure .
why , sir , i do my possible , which that ain't , said silver .
i can only , asking your pardon , save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure ; and you may lay to that .
well , silver , replied the doctor , if that is so , i'll go one step further : look out for squalls when you find it .
sir , said silver , as between man and man , that's too much and too little .
what you're after , why you left the block house , why you given me that there chart , i don't know , now , do i ?
and yet i done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope !
but no , this here's too much .
if you won't tell me what you mean plain out , just say so and i'll leave the helm .
no , said the doctor musingly ; i've no right to say more ; it's not my secret , you see , silver , or , i give you my word , i'd tell it you .
but i'll go as far with you as i dare go , and a step beyond , for i'll have my wig sorted by the captain or i'm mistaken !
and first , i'll give you a bit of hope ; silver , if we both get alive out of this wolftrap , i'll do my best to save you , short of perjury .
silver's face was radiant .
you couldn't say more , i'm sure , sir , not if you was my mother , he cried .
well , that's my first concession , added the doctor .
my second is a piece of advice : keep the boy close beside you , and when you need help , halloo .
i'm off to seek it for you , and that itself will show you if i speak at random .
goodbye , jim .
and dr .
livesey shook hands with me through the stockade , nodded to silver , and set off at a brisk pace into the wood .
jim , said silver when we were alone , if i saved your life , you saved mine ; and i'll not forget it .
i seen the doctor waving you to run for itwith the tail of my eye , i did ; and i seen you say no , as plain as hearing .
jim , that's one to you .
this is the first glint of hope i had since the attack failed , and i owe it you .
and now , jim , we're to go in for this here treasurehunting , with sealed orders too , and i don't like it ; and you and me must stick close , back to back like , and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune .
just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready , and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk .
they had lit a fire fit to roast an ox , and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward , and even there not without precaution .
in the same wasteful spirit , they had cooked , i suppose , three times more than we could eat ; and one of them , with an empty laugh , threw what was left into the fire , which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel .
i never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow ; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing ; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries , though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it , i could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign .
even silver , eating away , with captain flint upon his shoulder , had not a word of blame for their recklessness .
and this the more surprised me , for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then .
aye , mates , said he , it's lucky you have barbecue to think for you with this here head .
i got what i wanted , i did .
sure enough , they have the ship .
where they have it , i don't know yet ; but once we hit the treasure , we'll have to jump about and find out .
and then , mates , us that has the boats , i reckon , has the upper hand .
thus he kept running on , with his mouth full of the hot bacon ; thus he restored their hope and confidence , and , i more than suspect , repaired his own at the same time .
as for hostage , he continued , that's his last talk , i guess , with them he loves so dear .
i've got my piece o' news , and thanky to him for that ; but it's over and done .
i'll take him in a line when we go treasurehunting , for we'll keep him like so much gold , in case of accidents , you mark , and in the meantime .
once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions , why then we'll talk mr. hawkins over , we will , and we'll give him his share , to be sure , for all his kindness .
it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now .
for my part , i was horribly cast down .
should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible , silver , already doubly a traitor , would not hesitate to adopt it .
he had still a foot in either camp , and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging , which was the best he had to hope on our side .
nay , and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with dr .
livesey , even then what danger lay before us !
what a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and i should have to fight for dear lifehe a cripple and i a boyagainst five strong and active seamen !
add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends , their unexplained desertion of the stockade , their inexplicable cession of the chart , or harder still to understand , the doctor's last warning to silver , look out for squalls when you find it , and you will readily believe how little taste i found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart i set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure .
we made a curious figure , had anyone been there to see usall in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth .
silver had two guns slung about himone before and one behindbesides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his squaretailed coat .
to complete his strange appearance , captain flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless seatalk .
i had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the seacook , who held the loose end of the rope , now in his free hand , now between his powerful teeth .
for all the world , i was led like a dancing bear .
the other men were variously burthened , some carrying picks and shovelsfor that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the hispaniolaothers laden with pork , bread , and brandy for the midday meal .
all the stores , i observed , came from our stock , and i could see the truth of silver's words the night before .
had he not struck a bargain with the doctor , he and his mutineers , deserted by the ship , must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting .
water would have been little to their taste ; a sailor is not usually a good shot ; and besides all that , when they were so short of eatables , it was not likely they would be very flush of powder .
well , thus equipped , we all set outeven the fellow with the broken head , who should certainly have kept in shadowand straggled , one after another , to the beach , where the two gigs awaited us .
even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates , one in a broken thwart , and both in their muddy and unbailed condition .
both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety ; and so , with our numbers divided between them , we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage .
as we pulled over , there was some discussion on the chart .
the red cross was , of course , far too large to be a guide ; and the terms of the note on the back , as you will hear , admitted of some ambiguity .
they ran , the reader may remember , thus : tall tree , spyglass shoulder , bearing a point to the n .
of n .
n .
e .
skeleton island e .
s .
e .
and by e .
ten feet .
a tall tree was thus the principal mark .
now , right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high , adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the spyglass and rising again towards the south into the rough , cliffy eminence called the mizzenmast hill .
the top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pinetrees of varying height .
every here and there , one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours , and which of these was the particular tall tree of captain flint could only be decided on the spot , and by the readings of the compass .
yet , although that was the case , every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were halfway over , long john alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there .
we pulled easily , by silver's directions , not to weary the hands prematurely , and after quite a long passage , landed at the mouth of the second riverthat which runs down a woody cleft of the spyglass .
thence , bending to our left , we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau .
at the first outset , heavy , miry ground and a matted , marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress ; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot , and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order .
it was , indeed , a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching .
a heavyscented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass .
thickets of green nutmegtrees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines ; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others .
the air , besides , was fresh and stirring , and this , under the sheer sunbeams , was a wonderful refreshment to our senses .
the party spread itself abroad , in a fan shape , shouting and leaping to and fro .
about the centre , and a good way behind the rest , silver and i followedi tethered by my rope , he ploughing , with deep pants , among the sliding gravel .
from time to time , indeed , i had to lend him a hand , or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill .
we had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud , as if in terror .
shout after shout came from him , and the others began to run in his direction .
he can't 'a found the treasure , said old morgan , hurrying past us from the right , for that's clean atop .
indeed , as we found when we also reached the spot , it was something very different .
at the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper , which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones , a human skeleton lay , with a few shreds of clothing , on the ground .
i believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart .
he was a seaman , said george merry , who , bolder than the rest , had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing .
leastways , this is good seacloth .
aye , aye , said silver ; like enough ; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here , i reckon .
but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie ?
'tain't in natur' .
indeed , on a second glance , it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position .
but for some disarray the work , perhaps , of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slowgrowing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straighthis feet pointing in one direction , his hands , raised above his head like a diver's , pointing directly in the opposite .
i've taken a notion into my old numbskull , observed silver .
here's the compass ; there's the tiptop p'int o' skeleton island , stickin' out like a tooth .
just take a bearing , will you , along the line of them bones .
it was done .
the body pointed straight in the direction of the island , and the compass read duly e .
s .
e .
and by e .
i thought so , cried the cook ; this here is a p'inter .
right up there is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars .
but , by thunder !
if it don't make me cold inside to think of flint .
this is one of his jokes , and no mistake .
him and these six was alone here ; he killed 'em , every man ; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass , shiver my timbers !
they're long bones , and the hair's been yellow .
aye , that would be allardyce .
you mind allardyce , tom morgan ?
aye , aye , returned morgan ; i mind him ; he owed me money , he did , and took my knife ashore with him .
speaking of knives , said another , why don't we find his'n lying round ?
flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket ; and the birds , i guess , would leave it be .
by the powers , and that's true !
cried silver .
there ain't a thing left here , said merry , still feeling round among the bones ; not a copper doit nor a baccy box .
it don't look nat'ral to me .
no , by gum , it don't , agreed silver ; not nat'ral , nor not nice , says you .
great guns !
messmates , but if flint was living , this would be a hot spot for you and me .
six they were , and six are we ; and bones is what they are now .
i saw him dead with these here deadlights , said morgan .
billy took me in .
there he laid , with pennypieces on his eyes .
deadaye , sure enough he's dead and gone below , said the fellow with the bandage ; but if ever sperrit walked , it would be flint's .
dear heart , but he died bad , did flint !
aye , that he did , observed another ; now he raged , and now he hollered for the rum , and now he sang .
'fifteen men' were his only song , mates ; and i tell you true , i never rightly liked to hear it since .
it was main hot , and the windy was open , and i hear that old song comin' out as clear as clearand the deathhaul on the man already .
come , come , said silver ; stow this talk .
he's dead , and he don't walk , that i know ; leastways , he won't walk by day , and you may lay to that .
care killed a cat .
fetch ahead for the doubloons .
we started , certainly ; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight , the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood , but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath .
the terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits .
partly from the damping influence of this alarm , partly to rest silver and the sick folk , the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent .
the plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west , this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand .
before us , over the treetops , we beheld the cape of the woods fringed with surf ; behind , we not only looked down upon the anchorage and skeleton island , but sawclear across the spit and the eastern lowlandsa great field of open sea upon the east .
sheer above us rose the spyglass , here dotted with single pines , there black with precipices .
there was no sound but that of the distant breakers , mounting from all round , and the chirp of countless insects in the brush .
not a man , not a sail , upon the sea ; the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude .
silver , as he sat , took certain bearings with his compass .
there are three 'tall trees' said he , about in the right line from skeleton island .
'spyglass shoulder ,' i take it , means that lower p'int there .
it's child's play to find the stuff now .
i've half a mind to dine first .
i don't feel sharp , growled morgan .
thinkin' o' flinti think it wereas done me .
ah , well , my son , you praise your stars he's dead , said silver .
he were an ugly devil , cried a third pirate with a shudder ; that blue in the face too !
that was how the rum took him , added merry .
blue !
well , i reckon he was blue .
that's a true word .
ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought , they had spoken lower and lower , and they had almost got to whispering by now , so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood .
all of a sudden , out of the middle of the trees in front of us , a thin , high , trembling voice struck up the wellknown air and words : fifteen men on the dead man's chest yohoho , and a bottle of rum !
i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates .
the colour went from their six faces like enchantment ; some leaped to their feet , some clawed hold of others ; morgan grovelled on the ground .
it's flint , by  !
cried merry .
the song had stopped as suddenly as it beganbroken off , you would have said , in the middle of a note , as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer's mouth .
coming through the clear , sunny atmosphere among the green treetops , i thought it had sounded airily and sweetly ; and the effect on my companions was the stranger .
come , said silver , struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out ; this won't do .
stand by to go about .
this is a rum start , and i can't name the voice , but it's someone skylarkingsomeone that's flesh and blood , and you may lay to that .
his courage had come back as he spoke , and some of the colour to his face along with it .
already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves , when the same voice broke out againnot this time singing , but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the spyglass .
darby m'graw , it wailedfor that is the word that best describes the sounddarby m'graw !
darby m'graw !
again and again and again ; and then rising a little higher , and with an oath that i leave out : fetch aft the rum , darby !
the buccaneers remained rooted to the ground , their eyes starting from their heads .
long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence , dreadfully , before them .
that fixes it !
gasped one .
let's go .
they was his last words , moaned morgan , his last words above board .
dick had his bible out and was praying volubly .
he had been well brought up , had dick , before he came to sea and fell among bad companions .
still silver was unconquered .
i could hear his teeth rattle in his head , but he had not yet surrendered .
nobody in this here island ever heard of darby , he muttered ; not one but us that's here .
and then , making a great effort : shipmates , he cried , i'm here to get that stuff , and i'll not be beat by man or devil .
i never was feared of flint in his life , and , by the powers , i'll face him dead .
there's seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here .
when did ever a gentleman o' fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mugand him dead too ?
but there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers , rather , indeed , of growing terror at the irreverence of his words .
belay there , john !
said merry .
don't you cross a sperrit .
and the rest were all too terrified to reply .
they would have run away severally had they dared ; but fear kept them together , and kept them close by john , as if his daring helped them .
he , on his part , had pretty well fought his weakness down .
sperrit ?
well , maybe , he said .
but there's one thing not clear to me .
there was an echo .
now , no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow ; well then , what's he doing with an echo to him , i should like to know ?
that ain't in natur' , surely ?
this argument seemed weak enough to me .
but you can never tell what will affect the superstitious , and to my wonder , george merry was greatly relieved .
well , that's so , he said .
you've a head upon your shoulders , john , and no mistake .
'bout ship , mates !
this here crew is on a wrong tack , i do believe .
and come to think on it , it was like flint's voice , i grant you , but not just so clearaway like it , after all .
it was liker somebody else's voice nowit was liker by the powers , ben gunn !
roared silver .
aye , and so it were , cried morgan , springing on his knees .
ben gunn it were !
it don't make much odds , do it , now ?
asked dick .
ben gunn's not here in the body any more'n flint .
but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn .
why , nobody minds ben gunn , cried merry ; dead or alive , nobody minds him .
it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces .
soon they were chatting together , with intervals of listening ; and not long after , hearing no further sound , they shouldered the tools and set forth again , merry walking first with silver's compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton island .
he had said the truth : dead or alive , nobody minded ben gunn .
dick alone still held his bible , and looked around him as he went , with fearful glances ; but he found no sympathy , and silver even joked him on his precautions .
i told you , said hei told you you had sp'iled your bible .
if it ain't no good to swear by , what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it ?
not that !
and he snapped his big fingers , halting a moment on his crutch .
but dick was not to be comforted ; indeed , it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick ; hastened by heat , exhaustion , and the shock of his alarm , the fever , predicted by dr .
livesey , was evidently growing swiftly higher .
it was fine open walking here , upon the summit ; our way lay a little downhill , for , as i have said , the plateau tilted towards the west .
the pines , great and small , grew wide apart ; and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea , wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine .
striking , as we did , pretty near northwest across the island , we drew , on the one hand , ever nearer under the shoulders of the spyglass , and on the other , looked ever wider over that western bay where i had once tossed and trembled in the coracle .
the first of the tall trees was reached , and by the bearings proved the wrong one .
so with the second .
the third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwooda giant of a vegetable , with a red column as big as a cottage , and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred .
it was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart .
but it was not its size that now impressed my companions ; it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow .
the thought of the money , as they drew nearer , swallowed up their previous terrors .
their eyes burned in their heads ; their feet grew speedier and lighter ; their whole soul was bound up in that fortune , that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure , that lay waiting there for each of them .
silver hobbled , grunting , on his crutch ; his nostrils stood out and quivered ; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance ; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look .
certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts , and certainly i read them like print .
in the immediate nearness of the gold , all else had been forgotten : his promise and the doctor's warning were both things of the past , and i could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure , find and board the hispaniola under cover of night , cut every honest throat about that island , and sail away as he had at first intended , laden with crimes and riches .
shaken as i was with these alarms , it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasurehunters .
now and again i stumbled , and it was then that silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances .
dick , who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear , was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising .
this also added to my wretchedness , and to crown all , i was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau , when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue facehe who died at savannah , singing and shouting for drinkhad there , with his own hand , cut down his six accomplices .
this grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries , i thought ; and even with the thought i could believe i heard it ringing still .
we were now at the margin of the thicket .
huzza , mates , all together !
shouted merry ; and the foremost broke into a run .
and suddenly , not ten yards further , we beheld them stop .
a low cry arose .
silver doubled his pace , digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed ; and next moment he and i had come also to a dead halt .
before us was a great excavation , not very recent , for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom .
in this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packingcases strewn around .
on one of these boards i saw , branded with a hot iron , the name walrusthe name of flint's ship .
all was clear to probation .
the cache had been found and rifled ; the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone !
there never was such an overturn in this world .
each of these six men was as though he had been struck .
but with silver the blow passed almost instantly .
every thought of his soul had been set fullstretch , like a racer , on that money ; well , he was brought up , in a single second , dead ; and he kept his head , found his temper , and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment .
jim , he whispered , take that , and stand by for trouble .
and he passed me a doublebarrelled pistol .
at the same time , he began quietly moving northward , and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five .
then he looked at me and nodded , as much as to say , here is a narrow corner , as , indeed , i thought it was .
his looks were not quite friendly , and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering , so you've changed sides again .
there was no time left for him to answer in .
the buccaneers , with oaths and cries , began to leap , one after another , into the pit and to dig with their fingers , throwing the boards aside as they did so .
morgan found a piece of gold .
he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths .
it was a twoguinea piece , and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute .
two guineas !
roared merry , shaking it at silver .
that's your seven hundred thousand pounds , is it ?
you're the man for bargains , ain't you ?
you're him that never bungled nothing , you woodenheaded lubber !
dig away , boys , said silver with the coolest insolence ; you'll find some pignuts and i shouldn't wonder .
pignuts !
repeated merry , in a scream .
mates , do you hear that ?
i tell you now , that man there knew it all along .
look in the face of him and you'll see it wrote there .
ah , merry , remarked silver , standing for cap'n again ?
you're a pushing lad , to be sure .
but this time everyone was entirely in merry's favour .
they began to scramble out of the excavation , darting furious glances behind them .
one thing i observed , which looked well for us : they all got out upon the opposite side from silver .
well , there we stood , two on one side , five on the other , the pit between us , and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow .
silver never moved ; he watched them , very upright on his crutch , and looked as cool as ever i saw him .
he was brave , and no mistake .
at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters .
mates , says he , there's two of them alone there ; one's the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this ; the other's that cub that i mean to have the heart of .
now , mates he was raising his arm and his voice , and plainly meant to lead a charge .
but just thencrack !
crack !
crack !
threemusketshots flashed out of the thicket .
merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation ; the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side , where he lay dead , but still twitching ; and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might .
before you could wink , long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry , and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony , george , said he , i reckon i settled you .
at the same moment , the doctor , gray , and ben gunn joined us , with smoking muskets , from among the nutmegtrees .
forward !
cried the doctor .
double quick , my lads .
we must head 'em off the boats .
and we set off at a great pace , sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest .
i tell you , but silver was anxious to keep up with us .
the work that man went through , leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst , was work no sound man ever equalled ; and so thinks the doctor .
as it was , he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope .
doctor , he hailed , see there !
no hurry !
sure enough there was no hurry .
in a more open part of the plateau , we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started , right for mizzenmast hill .
we were already between them and the boats ; and so we four sat down to breathe , while long john , mopping his face , came slowly up with us .
thank ye kindly , doctor , says he .
you came in in about the nick , i guess , for me and hawkins .
and so it's you , ben gunn !
he added .
well , you're a nice one , to be sure .
i'm ben gunn , i am , replied the maroon , wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment .
and , he added , after a long pause , how do , mr. silver ?
pretty well , i thank ye , says you .
ben , ben , murmured silver , to think as you've done me !
the doctor sent back gray for one of the pickaxes deserted , in their flight , by the mutineers , and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying , related in a few words what had taken place .
it was a story that profoundly interested silver ; and ben gunn , the halfidiot maroon , was the hero from beginning to end .
ben , in his long , lonely wanderings about the island , had found the skeletonit was he that had rifled it ; he had found the treasure ; he had dug it up it was the haft of his pickaxe that lay broken in the excavation ; he had carried it on his back , in many weary journeys , from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the twopointed hill at the northeast angle of the island , and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the hispaniola .
when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack , and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted , he had gone to silver , given him the chart , which was now uselessgiven him the stores , for ben gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himselfgiven anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the twopointed hill , there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money .
as for you , jim , he said , it went against my heart , but i did what i thought best for those who had stood by their duty ; and if you were not one of these , whose fault was it ?
that morning , finding that i was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers , he had run all the way to the cave , and leaving the squire to guard the captain , had taken gray and the maroon and started , making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine .
soon , however , he saw that our party had the start of him ; and ben gunn , being fleet of foot , had been dispatched in front to do his best alone .
then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates , and he was so far successful that gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasurehunters .
ah , said silver , it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here .
you would have let old john be cut to bits , and never given it a thought , doctor .
not a thought , replied dr .
livesey cheerily .
and by this time we had reached the gigs .
the doctor , with the pickaxe , demolished one of them , and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for north inlet .
this was a run of eight or nine miles .
silver , though he was almost killed already with fatigue , was set to an oar , like the rest of us , and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea .
soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the southeast corner of the island , round which , four days ago , we had towed the hispaniola .
as we passed the twopointed hill , we could see the black mouth of ben gunn's cave and a figure standing by it , leaning on a musket .
it was the squire , and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers , in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any .
three miles farther , just inside the mouth of north inlet , what should we meet but the hispaniola , cruising by herself ?
the last flood had lifted her , and had there been much wind or a strong tide current , as in the southern anchorage , we should never have found her more , or found her stranded beyond help .
as it was , there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the mainsail .
another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water .
we all pulled round again to rum cove , the nearest point for ben gunn's treasurehouse ; and then gray , singlehanded , returned with the gig to the hispaniola , where he was to pass the night on guard .
a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave .
at the top , the squire met us .
to me he was cordial and kind , saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise .
at silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed .
john silver , he said , you're a prodigious villain and impostera monstrous imposter , sir .
i am told i am not to prosecute you .
well , then , i will not .
but the dead men , sir , hang about your neck like millstones .
thank you kindly , sir , replied long john , again saluting .
i dare you to thank me !
cried the squire .
it is a gross dereliction of my duty .
stand back .
and thereupon we all entered the cave .
it was a large , airy place , with a little spring and a pool of clear water , overhung with ferns .
the floor was sand .
before a big fire lay captain smollett ; and in a far corner , only duskily flickered over by the blaze , i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold .
that was flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola .
how many it had cost in the amassing , what blood and sorrow , what good ships scuttled on the deep , what brave men walking the plank blindfold , what shot of cannon , what shame and lies and cruelty , perhaps no man alive could tell .
yet there were still three upon that islandsilver , and old morgan , and ben gunnwho had each taken his share in these crimes , as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward .
come in , jim , said the captain .
you're a good boy in your line , jim , but i don't think you and me'll go to sea again .
you're too much of the born favourite for me .
is that you , john silver ?
what brings you here , man ?
come back to my dooty , sir , returned silver .
ah !
said the captain , and that was all he said .
what a supper i had of it that night , with all my friends around me ; and what a meal it was , with ben gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola .
never , i am sure , were people gayer or happier .
and there was silver , sitting back almost out of the firelight , but eating heartily , prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted , even joining quietly in our laughterthe same bland , polite , obsequious seaman of the voyage out .
the next morning we fell early to work , for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach , and thence three miles by boat to the hispaniola , was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen .
the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us ; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught , and we thought , besides , they had had more than enough of fighting .
therefore the work was pushed on briskly .
gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat , while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach .
two of the bars , slung in a rope's end , made a good load for a grown manone that he was glad to walk slowly with .
for my part , as i was not much use at carrying , i was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into breadbags .
it was a strange collection , like billy bones's hoard for the diversity of coinage , but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i never had more pleasure than in sorting them .
english , french , spanish , portuguese , georges , and louises , doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins , the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years , strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web , round pieces and square pieces , and pieces bored through the middle , as if to wear them round your necknearly every variety of money in the world must , i think , have found a place in that collection ; and for number , i am sure they were like autumn leaves , so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out .
day after day this work went on ; by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard , but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow ; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers .
at lasti think it was on the third nightthe doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle , when , from out the thick darkness below , the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing .
it was only a snatch that reached our ears , followed by the former silence .
heaven forgive them , said the doctor ; 'tis the mutineers !
all drunk , sir , struck in the voice of silver from behind us .
silver , i should say , was allowed his entire liberty , and in spite of daily rebuffs , seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent .
indeed , it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all .
yet , i think , none treated him better than a dog , unless it was ben gunn , who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster , or myself , who had really something to thank him for ; although for that matter , i suppose , i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else , for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau .
accordingly , it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him .
drunk or raving , said he .
right you were , sir , replied silver ; and precious little odds which , to you and me .
i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man , returned the doctor with a sneer , and so my feelings may surprise you , master silver .
but if i were sure they were ravingas i am morally certain one , at least , of them is down with feveri should leave this camp , and at whatever risk to my own carcass , take them the assistance of my skill .
ask your pardon , sir , you would be very wrong , quoth silver .
you would lose your precious life , and you may lay to that .
i'm on your side now , hand and glove ; and i shouldn't wish for to see the party weakened , let alone yourself , seeing as i know what i owes you .
but these men down there , they couldn't keep their wordno , not supposing they wished to ; and what's more , they couldn't believe as you could .
no , said the doctor .
you're the man to keep your word , we know that .
well , that was about the last news we had of the three pirates .
only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting .
a council was held , and it was decided that we must desert them on the islandto the huge glee , i must say , of ben gunn , and with the strong approval of gray .
we left a good stock of powder and shot , the bulk of the salt goat , a few medicines , and some other necessaries , tools , clothing , a spare sail , a fathom or two of rope , and by the particular desire of the doctor , a handsome present of tobacco .
that was about our last doing on the island .
before that , we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress ; and at last , one fine morning , we weighed anchor , which was about all that we could manage , and stood out of north inlet , the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade .
the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for , as we soon had proved .
for coming through the narrows , we had to lie very near the southern point , and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand , with their arms raised in supplication .
it went to all our hearts , i think , to leave them in that wretched state ; but we could not risk another mutiny ; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness .
the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left , and where they were to find them .
but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us , for god's sake , to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place .
at last , seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot , one of themi know not which it wasleapt to his feet with a hoarse cry , whipped his musket to his shoulder , and sent a shot whistling over silver's head and through the mainsail .
after that , we kept under cover of the bulwarks , and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit , and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance .
that was , at least , the end of that ; and before noon , to my inexpressible joy , the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea .
we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a handonly the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders , for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet .
we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america , for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands ; and as it was , what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales , we were all worn out before we reached it .
it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful landlocked gulf , and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of negroes and mexican indians and halfbloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money .
the sight of so many goodhumoured faces especially the blacks , the taste of the tropical fruits , and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island ; and the doctor and the squire , taking me along with them , went ashore to pass the early part of the night .
here they met the captain of an english manofwar , fell in talk with him , went on board his ship , and , in short , had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola .
ben gunn was on deck alone , and as soon as we came on board he began , with wonderful contortions , to make us a confession .
silver was gone .
the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago , and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives , which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard .
but this was not all .
the seacook had not gone emptyhanded .
he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin , worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas , to help him on his further wanderings .
i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him .
well , to make a long story short , we got a few hands on board , made a good cruise home , and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr. blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort .
five men only of those who had sailed returned with her .
drink and the devil had done for the rest , with a vengeance , although , to be sure , we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about : with one man of her crew alive , what put to sea with seventyfive .
all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly , according to our natures .
captain smollett is now retired from the sea .
gray not only saved his money , but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise , also studied his profession , and he is now mate and part owner of a fine fullrigged ship , married besides , and the father of a family .
as for ben gunn , he got a thousand pounds , which he spent or lost in three weeks , or to be more exact , in nineteen days , for he was back begging on the twentieth .
then he was given a lodge to keep , exactly as he had feared upon the island ; and he still lives , a great favourite , though something of a butt , with the country boys , and a notable singer in church on sundays and saints' days .
of silver we have heard no more .
that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life ; but i dare say he met his old negress , and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint .
it is to be hoped so , i suppose , for his chances of comfort in another world are very small .
the bar silver and the arms still lie , for all that i know , where flint buried them ; and certainly they shall lie there for me .
oxen and wainropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island ; and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my ears : pieces of eight !
pieces of eight !
one morning , when gregor samsa woke from troubled dreams , he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin .
he lay on his armourlike back , and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly , slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections .
the bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment .
his many legs , pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him , waved about helplessly as he looked .
what's happened to me ?
he thought .
it wasn't a dream .
his room , a proper human room although a little too small , lay peacefully between its four familiar walls .
a collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table  samsa was a travelling salesman  and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice , gilded frame .
it showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright , raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer .
gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather .
drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane , which made him feel quite sad .
how about if i sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense , he thought , but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right , and in his present state couldn't get into that position .
however hard he threw himself onto his right , he always rolled back to where he was .
he must have tried it a hundred times , shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs , and only stopped when he began to feel a mild , dull pain there that he had never felt before .
oh , god , he thought , what a strenuous career it is that i've chosen !
travelling day in and day out .
doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home , and on top of that there's the curse of travelling , worries about making train connections , bad and irregular food , contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them .
it can all go to hell !
he felt a slight itch up on his belly ; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better ; found where the itch was , and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of ; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder .
he slid back into his former position .
getting up early all the time , he thought , it makes you stupid .
you've got to get enough sleep .
other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury .
for instance , whenever i go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract , these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts .
i ought to just try that with my boss ; i'd get kicked out on the spot .
but who knows , maybe that would be the best thing for me .
if i didn't have my parents to think about i'd have given in my notice a long time ago , i'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think , tell him everything i would , let him know just what i feel .
he'd fall right off his desk !
and it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk , talking down at your subordinates from up there , especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing .
well , there's still some hope ; once i've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him  another five or six years i suppose  that's definitely what i'll do .
that's when i'll make the big change .
first of all though , i've got to get up , my train leaves at five .
and he looked over at the alarm clock , ticking on the chest of drawers .
god in heaven !
he thought .
it was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards , it was even later than half past , more like quarter to seven .
had the alarm clock not rung ?
he could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been ; it certainly must have rung .
yes , but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniturerattling noise ?
true , he had not slept peacefully , but probably all the more deeply because of that .
what should he do now ?
the next train went at seven ; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed , and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively .
and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go , he would have put in his report about gregor's not being there a long time ago .
the office assistant was the boss's man , spineless , and with no understanding .
what about if he reported sick ?
but that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service gregor had never once yet been ill .
his boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company , accuse his parents of having a lazy son , and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that noone was ever ill but that many were workshy .
and what's more , would he have been entirely wrong in this case ?
gregor did in fact , apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long , feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual .
he was still hurriedly thinking all this through , unable to decide to get out of the bed , when the clock struck quarter to seven .
there was a cautious knock at the door near his head .
gregor , somebody called  it was his mother  it's quarter to seven .
didn't you want to go somewhere ?
that gentle voice !
gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering , it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before .
as if from deep inside him , there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it , the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear , leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not .
gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything , but in the circumstances contented himself with saying : yes , mother , yes , thankyou , i'm getting up now .
the change in gregor's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door , as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away .
but this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that gregor , against their expectations was still at home , and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors , gently , but with his fist .
gregor , gregor , he called , what's wrong ?
and after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice : gregor !
gregor !
at the other side door his sister came plaintively : gregor ?
aren't you well ?
do you need anything ?
gregor answered to both sides : i'm ready , now , making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each , individual word .
his father went back to his breakfast , but his sister whispered : gregor , open the door , i beg of you .
gregor , however , had no thought of opening the door , and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit , acquired from his travelling , of locking all doors at night even when he was at home .
the first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed , to get dressed , and most of all to have his breakfast .
only then would he consider what to do next , as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed .
he remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed , perhaps caused by lying awkwardly , but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today .
he did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold , which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen .
it was a simple matter to throw off the covers ; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves .
but it became difficult after that , especially as he was so exceptionally broad .
he would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up ; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions , and which he was moreover unable to control .
if he wanted to bend one of them , then that was the first one that would stretch itself out ; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg , all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully .
this is something that can't be done in bed , gregor said to himself , so don't keep trying to do it .
the first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed , but he had never seen this lower part , and could not imagine what it looked like ; it turned out to be too hard to move ; it went so slowly ; and finally , almost in a frenzy , when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather , he chose the wrong direction , hit hard against the lower bedpost , and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well , at present , be the most sensitive .
so then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first , carefully turning his head to the side .
this he managed quite easily , and despite its breadth and its weight , the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head .
but when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured , so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way .
and he could not knock himself out now at any price ; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness .
it took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier , but when he lay there sighing , and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before , if that was possible , he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos .
he told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice .
at the same time , though , he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions .
at times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could , but unfortunately , even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him .
seven o'clock , already , he said to himself when the clock struck again , seven o'clock , and there's still a fog like this .
and he lay there quietly a while longer , breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state .
but then he said to himself : before it strikes quarter past seven i'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed .
and by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me as well , as they open up at work before seven o'clock .
and so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time .
if he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it .
his back seemed to be quite hard , and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet .
his main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make , and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm .
but it was something that had to be risked .
when gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed  the new method was more of a game than an effort , all he had to do was rock back and forth  it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him .
two strong people  he had his father and the maid in mind  would have been more than enough ; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back , peel him away from the bed , bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor , where , hopefully , the little legs would find a use .
should he really call for help though , even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked ?
despite all the difficulty he was in , he could not suppress a smile at this thought .
after a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard .
the time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon .
then there was a ring at the door of the flat .
that'll be someone from work , he said to himself , and froze very still , although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around .
for a moment everything remained quiet .
they're not opening the door , gregor said to himself , caught in some nonsensical hope .
but then of course , the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it .
gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was  the chief clerk himself .
why did gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming ?
were all employees , every one of them , louts , was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business ?
was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries  assuming enquiries were even necessary  did the chief clerk have to come himself , and did they have to show the whole , innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it ?
and more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision , he swang himself with all his force out of the bed .
there was a loud thump , but it wasn't really a loud noise .
his fall was softened a little by the carpet , and gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought , which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable .
he had not held his head carefully enough , though , and hit it as he fell ; annoyed and in pain , he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet .
something's fallen down in there , said the chief clerk in the room on the left .
gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too ; you had to concede that it was possible .
but as if in gruff reply to this question , the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room .
from the room on his right , gregor's sister whispered to him to let him know : gregor , the chief clerk is here .
yes , i know , said gregor to himself ; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him .
gregor , said his father now from the room to his left , the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the early train .
we don't know what to say to him .
and anyway , he wants to speak to you personally .
so please open up this door .
i'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room .
then the chief clerk called good morning , mr. samsa .
he isn't well , said his mother to the chief clerk , while his father continued to speak through the door .
he isn't well , please believe me .
why else would gregor have missed a train !
the lad only ever thinks about the business .
it nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings ; he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening .
he sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables .
his idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw .
he's made a little frame , for instance , it only took him two or three evenings , you'll be amazed how nice it is ; it's hanging up in his room ; you'll see it as soon as gregor opens the door .
anyway , i'm glad you're here ; we wouldn't have been able to get gregor to open the door by ourselves ; he's so stubborn ; and i'm sure he isn't well , he said this morning that he is , but he isn't .
i'll be there in a moment , said gregor slowly and thoughtfully , but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation .
well i can't think of any other way of explaining it , mrs. samsa , said the chief clerk , i hope it's nothing serious .
but on the other hand , i must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then , fortunately or unfortunately as you like , we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations .
can the chief clerk come in to see you now then ?
 ,asked his father impatiently , knocking at the door again .
no , said gregor .
in the room on his right there followed a painful silence ; in the room on his left his sister began to cry .
so why did his sister not go and join the others ?
she had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed .
and why was she crying ?
was it because he had not got up , and had not let the chief clerk in , because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before ?
there was no need to worry about things like that yet .
gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family .
for the time being he just lay there on the carpet , and noone who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in .
it was only a minor discourtesy , and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on , it was not something for which gregor could be sacked on the spot .
and it seemed to gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying .
but the others didn't know what was happening , they were worried , that would excuse their behaviour .
the chief clerk now raised his voice , mr .
samsa , he called to him , what is wrong ?
you barricade yourself in your room , give us no more than yes or no for an answer , you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail  and i mention this just by the way  you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of .
i'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer , and really must request a clear and immediate explanation .
i am astonished , quite astonished .
i thought i knew you as a calm and sensible person , and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims .
this morning , your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear , it's true  it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you  but i came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation .
but now that i see your incomprehensible stubbornness i no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf .
and nor is your position all that secure .
i had originally intended to say all this to you in private , but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason i don't see why your parents should not also learn of it .
your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late ; i grant you that it's not the time of year to do especially good business , we recognise that ; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all , mr. samsa , we cannot allow there to be .
but sir , called gregor , beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement , i'll open up immediately , just a moment .
i'm slightly unwell , an attack of dizziness , i haven't been able to get up .
i'm still in bed now .
i'm quite fresh again now , though .
i'm just getting out of bed .
just a moment .
be patient !
it's not quite as easy as i'd thought .
i'm quite alright now , though .
it's shocking , what can suddenly happen to a person !
i was quite alright last night , my parents know about it , perhaps better than me , i had a small symptom of it last night already .
they must have noticed it .
i don't know why i didn't let you know at work !
but you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home .
please , don't make my parents suffer !
there's no basis for any of the accusations you're making ; nobody's ever said a word to me about any of these things .
maybe you haven't read the latest contracts i sent in .
i'll set off with the eight o'clock train , as well , these few hours of rest have given me strength .
you don't need to wait , sir ; i'll be in the office soon after you , and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him !
and while gregor gushed out these words , hardly knowing what he was saying , he made his way over to the chest of drawers  this was easily done , probably because of the practise he had already had in bed  where he now tried to get himself upright .
he really did want to open the door , really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk ; the others were being so insistent , and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him .
if they were shocked then it would no longer be gregor's responsibility and he could rest .
if , however , they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset , and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o'clock .
the first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again , but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright ; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it .
now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs .
by now he had also calmed down , and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying .
did you understand a word of all that ?
the chief clerk asked his parents , surely he's not trying to make fools of us .
oh , god !
called his mother , who was already in tears , he could be seriously ill and we're making him suffer .
grete !
grete !
she then cried .
mother ?
his sister called from the other side .
they communicated across gregor's room .
you'll have to go for the doctor straight away .
gregor is ill .
quick , get the doctor .
did you hear the way gregor spoke just now ?
that was the voice of an animal , said the chief clerk , with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's screams .
anna !
anna !
his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall , clapping his hands , get a locksmith here , now !
and the two girls , their skirts swishing , immediately ran out through the hall , wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went .
how had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly ?
there was no sound of the door banging shut again ; they must have left it open ; people often do in homes where something awful has happened .
gregor , in contrast , had become much calmer .
so they couldn't understand his words any more , although they seemed clear enough to him , clearer than before  perhaps his ears had become used to the sound .
they had realised , though , that there was something wrong with him , and were ready to help .
the first response to his situation had been confident and wise , and that made him feel better .
he felt that he had been drawn back in among people , and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements  although he did not really distinguish one from the other .
whatever was said next would be crucial , so , in order to make his voice as clear as possible , he coughed a little , but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself .
meanwhile , it had become very quiet in the next room .
perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk , or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening .
gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair .
once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door , holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs .
he rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth .
he seemed , unfortunately , to have no proper teeth  how was he , then , to grasp the key ?
 but the lack of teeth was , of course , made up for with a very strong jaw ; using the jaw , he really was able to start the key turning , ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth , flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor .
listen , said the chief clerk in the next room , he's turning the key .
gregor was greatly encouraged by this ; but they all should have been calling to him , his father and his mother too : well done , gregor , they should have cried , keep at it , keep hold of the lock !
and with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts , he bit on the key with all his strength , paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself .
as the key turned round he turned around the lock with it , only holding himself upright with his mouth , and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed .
the clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was gregor's sign that he could break his concentration , and as he regained his breath he said to himself : so , i didn't need the locksmith after all .
then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely .
because he had to open the door in this way , it was already wide open before he could be seen .
he had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors , and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room .
he was still occupied with this difficult movement , unable to pay attention to anything else , when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud oh !
 ,which sounded like the soughing of the wind .
now he also saw him  he was the nearest to the door  his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force .
gregor's mother , her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there , looked at his father .
then she unfolded her arms , took two steps forward towards gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast .
his father looked hostile , and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock gregor back into his room .
then he looked uncertainly round the living room , covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook .
so gregor did not go into the room , but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place .
in this way only half of his body could be seen , along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others .
meanwhile the day had become much lighter ; part of the endless , greyblack building on the other side of the street  which was a hospital  could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade ; the rain was still falling , now throwing down large , individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time .
the washing up from breakfast lay on the table ; there was so much of it because , for gregor's father , breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers .
on the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army , his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing .
the door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below .
now , then , said gregor , well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm , i'll get dressed straight away now , pack up my samples and set off .
will you please just let me leave ?
you can see , he said to the chief clerk , that i'm not stubborn and i like to do my job ; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling i couldn't earn my living .
so where are you going , in to the office ?
yes ?
will you report everything accurately , then ?
it's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work , but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on , once the difficulty has been removed , he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration .
you're well aware that i'm seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister , so that i'm trapped in a difficult situation , but i will work my way out of it again .
please don't make things any harder for me than they are already , and don't take sides against me at the office .
i know that nobody likes the travellers .
they think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it .
that's just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it .
but you , sir , you have a better overview than the rest of the staff , in fact , if i can say this in confidence , a better overview than the boss himself  it's very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should .
and you're also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office , so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints , and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing , we don't usually even hear about them , or if at all it's when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip , and that's when we feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused them .
please , don't go away , at least first say something to show that you grant that i'm at least partly right !
but the chief clerk had turned away as soon as gregor had started to speak , and , with protruding lips , only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left .
he did not keep still for a moment while gregor was speaking , but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him .
he moved very gradually , as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room .
it was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement , drew his foot from the living room , and rushed forward in a panic .
in the hall , he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there , there were some supernatural force waiting to save him .
gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger .
that was something his parents did not understand very well ; over the years , they had become convinced that this job would provide for gregor for his entire life , and besides , they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future .
gregor , though , did think about the future .
the chief clerk had to be held back , calmed down , convinced and finally won over ; the future of gregor and his family depended on it !
if only his sister were here !
she was clever ; she was already in tears while gregor was still lying peacefully on his back .
and the chief clerk was a lover of women , surely she could persuade him ; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state .
but his sister was not there , gregor would have to do the job himself .
and without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state , or that his speech still might not  or probably would not  be understood , he let go of the door ; pushed himself through the opening ; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who , ridiculously , was holding on to the banister with both hands ; but gregor fell immediately over and , with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto , landed on his numerous little legs .
hardly had that happened than , for the first time that day , he began to feel alright with his body ; the little legs had the solid ground under them ; to his pleasure , they did exactly as he told them ; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go ; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end .
he held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor .
his mother was not far away in front of him and seemed , at first , quite engrossed in herself , but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting : help , for pity's sake , help !
the way she held her head suggested she wanted to see gregor better , but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not ; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it ; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing ; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet .
mother , mother , said gregor gently , looking up at her .
he had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment , but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee .
that set his mother screaming anew , she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her .
gregor , though , had no time to spare for his parents now ; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs ; with his chin on the banister , he looked back for the last time .
gregor made a run for him ; he wanted to be sure of reaching him ; the chief clerk must have expected something , as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared ; his shouts resounding all around the staircase .
the flight of the chief clerk seemed , unfortunately , to put gregor's father into a panic as well .
until then he had been relatively self controlled , but now , instead of running after the chief clerk himself , or at least not impeding gregor as he ran after him , gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair , along with his hat and overcoat , picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left , and used them to drive gregor back into his room , stamping his foot at him as he went .
gregor's appeals to his father were of no help , his appeals were simply not understood , however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder .
across the room , despite the chilly weather , gregor's mother had pulled open a window , leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face .
a strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway , the curtains flew up , the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor .
nothing would stop gregor's father as he drove him back , making hissing noises at him like a wild man .
gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly .
if gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away , but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient , and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand any moment .
eventually , though , gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw , to his disgust , that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line ; so he began , as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father , to turn himself round .
it went very slowly , but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him , in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn .
if only his father would stop that unbearable hissing !
it was making gregor quite confused .
when he had nearly finished turning round , still listening to that hissing , he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come .
he was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway , but then saw that it was too narrow , and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty .
in his present mood , it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that gregor would have enough space to get through .
he was merely fixed on the idea that gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible .
nor would he ever have allowed gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway .
what he did , making more noise than ever , was to drive gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way ; it sounded to gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him ; it was not a pleasant experience , and gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen .
one side of his body lifted itself , he lay at an angle in the doorway , one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured , leaving vile brown flecks on it , soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself , the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground .
then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying , and heavily bleeding , deep into his room .
the door was slammed shut with the stick , then , finally , all was quiet .
it was not until it was getting dark that evening that gregor awoke from his deep and comalike sleep .
he would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed , as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested .
but he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him .
the light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture , but down below , where gregor was , it was dark .
he pushed himself over to the door , feeling his way clumsily with his antennae  of which he was now beginning to learn the value  in order to see what had been happening there .
the whole of his left side seemed like one , painfully stretched scar , and he limped badly on his two rows of legs .
one of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning  it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been  and dragged along lifelessly .
it was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it ; it was the smell of something to eat .
by the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it .
he was so pleased he almost laughed , as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning , and immediately dipped his head into the milk , nearly covering his eyes with it .
but he soon drew his head back again in disappointment ; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food  he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole  but the milk did not taste at all nice .
milk like this was normally his favourite drink , and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that , but he turned , almost against his own will , away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room .
through the crack in the door , gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room .
his father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper , reading it out in a loud voice to gregor's mother , and sometimes to his sister , but there was now not a sound to be heard .
gregor's sister would often write and tell him about this reading , but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times .
it was so quiet all around too , even though there must have been somebody in the flat .
what a quiet life it is the family lead , said gregor to himself , and , gazing into the darkness , felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents .
but what now , if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end ?
that was something that gregor did not want to think about too much , so he started to move about , crawling up and down the room .
once during that long evening , the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again ; later on the door on the other side did the same ; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it .
gregor went and waited immediately by the door , resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was ; but the door was opened no more that night and gregor waited in vain .
the previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him , but now , now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day , noone came , and the keys were in the other sides .
it was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out , and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time , as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tiptoe .
it was clear that noone would come into gregor's room any more until morning ; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to rearrange his life .
for some reason , the tall , empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor , even though he had been living in it for five years .
hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame , he hurried under the couch .
it pressed down on his back a little , and he was no longer able to lift his head , but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath .
he spent the whole night there .
some of the time he passed in a light sleep , although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger , and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which , however , always led to the same conclusion : for the time being he must remain calm , he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he , in his present condition , was forced to impose on them .
gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions , as early the next morning , almost before the night had ended , his sister , nearly fully dressed , opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in .
she did not see him straight away , but when she did notice him under the couch  he had to be somewhere , for god's sake , he couldn't have flown away  she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside .
but she seemed to regret her behaviour , as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tiptoe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger .
gregor had pushed his head forward , right to the edge of the couch , and watched her .
would she notice that he had left the milk as it was , realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable ?
if she didn't do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it , although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch , throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something good to eat .
however , his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise .
she immediately picked it up  using a rag , not her bare hands  and carried it out .
gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place , imagining the wildest possibilities , but he never could have guessed what his sister , in her goodness , actually did bring .
in order to test his taste , she brought him a whole selection of things , all spread out on an old newspaper .
there were old , halfrotten vegetables ; bones from the evening meal , covered in white sauce that had gone hard ; a few raisins and almonds ; some cheese that gregor had declared inedible two days before ; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt .
as well as all that she had poured some water into the dish , which had probably been permanently set aside for gregor's use , and placed it beside them .
then , out of consideration for gregor's feelings , as she knew that he would not eat in front of her , she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked .
gregor's little legs whirred , at last he could eat .
what's more , his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving .
this amazed him , as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife , he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday .
am i less sensitive than i used to be , then ?
 ,he thought , and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately , almost compellingly , attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper .
quickly one after another , his eyes watering with pleasure , he consumed the cheese , the vegetables and the sauce ; the fresh foods , on the other hand , he didn't like at all , and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn't stand the smell .
long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place , his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw .
he was immediately startled , although he had been half asleep , and he hurried back under the couch .
but he needed great selfcontrol to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room , as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space .
half suffocating , he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the leftovers , mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more .
she quickly dropped it all into a bin , closed it with its wooden lid , and carried everything out .
she had hardly turned her back before gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself .
this was how gregor received his food each day now , once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep , and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well , and gregor's sister would send the maid away on some errand .
gregor's father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either , but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it , and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough .
it was impossible for gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat .
as nobody could understand him , nobody , not even his sister , thought that he could understand them , so he had to be content to hear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room .
it was only later , when she had become a little more used to everything  there was , of course , no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation  that gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment , or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly .
he's enjoyed his dinner today , she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him , or if he left most of it , which slowly became more and more frequent , she would often say , sadly , now everything's just been left there again .
although gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms , and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it .
there was seldom any conversation , especially at first , that was not about him in some way , even if only in secret .
for two whole days , all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now ; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home  nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty .
and on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged gregor's mother to let her go without delay .
it was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour , tearfully thanking gregor's mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service .
she even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened , even though noone had asked that of her .
now gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking ; although that was not so much bother as noone ate very much .
gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat , and receive no more answer than no thanks , i've had enough or something similar .
noone drank very much either .
his sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer , hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself .
when his father then said nothing she would add , so that he would not feel selfish , that she could send the housekeeper for it , but then his father would close the matter with a big , loud no , and no more would be said .
even before the first day had come to an end , his father had explained to gregor's mother and sister what their finances and prospects were .
now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier .
gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted .
what he heard his father say was some of the first good news that gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room .
he had thought that nothing at all remained from his father's business , at least he had never told him anything different , and gregor had never asked him about it anyway .
their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair , and gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible .
so then he started working especially hard , with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight , bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways .
gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family .
they had been good times and they had never come again , at least not with the same splendour , even though gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family , and did bear them .
they had even got used to it , both gregor and the family , they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it , although there was no longer much warm affection given in return .
gregor only remained close to his sister now .
unlike him , she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist , it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way .
during gregor's short periods in town , conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised .
their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk , but gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on christmas day .
that was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state , pressed upright against the door and listening .
there were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening , when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start , as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent .
what's that he's doing now , his father would say after a while , clearly having gone over to the door , and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again .
when explaining things , his father repeated himself several times , partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because gregor's mother did not understand everything the first time .
from these repeated explanations gregor learned , to his pleasure , that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days .
it was not a lot , but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated .
besides that , they had not been using up all the money that gregor had been bringing home every month , keeping only a little for himself , so that that , too , had been accumulating .
behind the door , gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution .
he could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss , and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer , but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things .
this money , however , was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest ; it was enough to maintain them for , perhaps , one or two years , no more .
that's to say , it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies ; money to live on had to be earned .
his father was healthy but old , and lacking in self confidence .
during the five years that he had not been working  the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success  he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy .
would gregor's elderly mother now have to go and earn money ?
she suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home , every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window .
would his sister have to go and earn money ?
she was still a child of seventeen , her life up till then had been very enviable , consisting of wearing nice clothes , sleeping late , helping out in the business , joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin .
whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money , gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool , leather sofa next to it , as he became quite hot with shame and regret .
he would often lie there the whole night through , not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end .
or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window , climbing up onto the sill and , propped up in the chair , leaning on the window to stare out of it .
he had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this , but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced , as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day , even things that were quite near ; he had used to curse the everpresent view of the hospital across the street , but now he could not see it at all , and if he had not known that he lived in charlottenstrasse , which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city , he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably .
his observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room , and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on .
if gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it ; but as it was it caused him pain .
his sister , naturally , tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it , and the longer it went on , of course , the better she was able to do so , but as time went by gregor was also able to see through it all so much better .
it had even become very unpleasant for him , now , whenever she entered the room .
no sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that noone would have to suffer the view into gregor's room , then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating .
even if it was cold , she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while .
she would alarm gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making ; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while , knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal , but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed .
one day , about a month after gregor's transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance , she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window , motionless , and just where he would be most horrible .
in itself , his sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there , but not only did she not come in , she went straight back and closed the door behind her , a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her .
gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch , of course , but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual .
it made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so , she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch .
one day , in order to spare her even this sight , he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down .
if she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again , as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for gregor to cut himself off so completely .
she left the sheet where it was .
gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement .
for the first fourteen days , gregor's parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him .
he would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though , before , they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her .
but now the two of them , father and mother , would often both wait outside the door of gregor's room while his sister tidied up in there , and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked , what gregor had eaten , how he had behaved this time and whether , perhaps , any slight improvement could be seen .
his mother also wanted to go in and visit gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it .
gregor listened very closely to all this , and approved fully .
later , though , she had to be held back by force , which made her call out : let me go and see gregor , he is my unfortunate son !
can't you understand i have to see him ?
 ,and gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in , not every day of course , but one day a week , perhaps ; she could understand everything much better than his sister who , for all her courage , was still just a child after all , and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on .
gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised .
out of consideration for his parents , gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day , the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about , it was hard to just lie quietly through the night , his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all , and so , to entertain himself , he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling .
he was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling ; it was quite different from lying on the floor ; he could breathe more freely ; his body had a light swing to it ; and up there , relaxed and almost happy , it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash .
but now , of course , he had far better control of his body than before and , even with a fall as great as that , caused himself no damage .
very soon his sister noticed gregor's new way of entertaining himself  he had , after all , left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about  and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way , especially the chest of drawers and the desk .
now , this was not something that she would be able to do by herself ; she did not dare to ask for help from her father ; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this , she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important ; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when gregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her .
as she approached the room , gregor could hear his mother express her joy , but once at the door she went silent .
first , of course , his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright ; and only then did she let her mother enter .
gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance .
gregor also refrained , this time , from spying out from under the sheet ; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come .
you can come in , he can't be seen , said his sister , obviously leading her in by the hand .
the old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about , but gregor listened as they pushed it from its place , his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that she would strain herself .
this lasted a very long time .
after labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was , for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before gregor's father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more , and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him .
she thought just the opposite ; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart ; and why wouldn't gregor feel the same way about it , he'd been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that .
then , quietly , almost whispering as if wanting gregor whose whereabouts she did not know to hear not even the tone of her voice , as she was convinced that he did not understand her words , she added and by taking the furniture away , won't it seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to cope for himself ?
i think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when gregor comes back to us again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier .
hearing these words from his mother made gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication , along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months , must have made him confused  he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out .
had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave , a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited ?
that would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction , but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human .
he had come very close to forgetting , and it had only been the voice of his mother , unheard for so long , that had shaken him out of it .
nothing should be removed ; everything had to stay ; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition ; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage .
his sister , unfortunately , did not agree ; she had become used to the idea , not without reason , that she was gregor's spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him .
this meant that his mother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk , as she had thought at first , but all the furniture apart from the allimportant couch .
it was more than childish perversity , of course , or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired , that made her insist ; she had indeed noticed that gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in , whereas the furniture , as far as anyone could see , was of no use to him at all .
girls of that age , though , do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can .
perhaps this was what tempted grete to make gregor's situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him .
grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself .
so she refused to let her mother dissuade her .
gregor's mother already looked uneasy in his room , she soon stopped speaking and helped gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had .
the chest of drawers was something that gregor could do without if he had to , but the writing desk had to stay .
hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers , groaning , out of the room than gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it .
he meant to be as careful and considerate as he could , but , unfortunately , it was his mother who came back first while grete in the next room had her arms round the chest , pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without , of course , moving it an inch .
his mother was not used to the sight of gregor , he might have made her ill , so gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch .
in his startlement , though , he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little .
it was enough to attract his mother's attention .
she stood very still , remained there a moment , and then went back out to grete .
gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening , it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all , but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro , their little calls to each other , the scraping of the furniture on the floor , all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides .
with his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor , he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer .
they were emptying his room out ; taking away everything that was dear to him ; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools ; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor , the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee , at high school , even while he had been at infant schoolhe really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good .
he had nearly forgotten they were there anyway , as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor .
so , while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath , he sallied out , changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall  which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it  of the lady dressed in copious fur .
he hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass , it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly .
this picture at least , now totally covered by gregor , would certainly be taken away by noone .
he turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back .
they had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon ; grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her .
what shall we take now , then ?
 ,said grete and looked around .
her eyes met those of gregor on the wall .
perhaps only because her mother was there , she remained calm , bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said , albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice : come on , let's go back in the living room for a while ?
gregor could see what grete had in mind , she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall .
well , she could certainly try it !
he sat unyielding on his picture .
he would rather jump at grete's face .
but grete's words had made her mother quite worried , she stepped to one side , saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper , and before she even realised it was gregor that she saw screamed : oh god , oh god !
arms outstretched , she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile .
gregor !
shouted his sister , glowering at him and shaking her fist .
that was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation .
she ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint ; gregor wanted to help too  he could save his picture later , although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force ; then he , too , ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days ; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing ; she was looking into various bottles , he startled her when she turned round ; a bottle fell to the ground and broke ; a splinter cut gregor's face , some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him ; now , without delaying any longer , grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother ; she slammed the door shut with her foot .
so now gregor was shut out from his mother , who , because of him , might be near to death ; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away , and she had to stay with his mother ; there was nothing for him to do but wait ; and , oppressed with anxiety and selfreproach , he began to crawl about , he crawled over everything , walls , furniture , ceiling , and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table .
he lay there for a while , numb and immobile , all around him it was quiet , maybe that was a good sign .
then there was someone at the door .
the maid , of course , had locked herself in her kitchen so that grete would have to go and answer it .
his father had arrived home .
what's happened ?
were his first words ; grete's appearance must have made everything clear to him .
she answered him with subdued voice , and openly pressed her face into his chest : mother's fainted , but she's better now .
gregor got out .
just as i expected , said his father , just as i always said , but you women wouldn't listen , would you .
it was clear to gregor that grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened , that he was responsible for some act of violence .
that meant gregor would now have to try to calm his father , as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible .
so he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father , when he came in from the hall , could see straight away that gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay , that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear .
his father , though , was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that ; ah !
 ,he shouted as he came in , sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time .
gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father .
he really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now ; of late , with his new habit of crawling about , he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before .
he really ought to have expected things to have changed , but still , still , was that really his father ?
the same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when gregor came back from his business trips , who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings ; who was hardly even able to stand up but , as a sign of his pleasure , would just raise his arms and who , on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between gregor and his mother , would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them , who were already walking slowly for his sake ; who would place his stick down carefully and , if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him .
he was standing up straight enough now ; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons , the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute ; above the high , stiff collar of the coat his strong doublechin emerged ; under the bushy eyebrows , his piercing , dark eyes looked out fresh and alert ; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp .
he took his cap , with its gold monogram from , probably , some bank , and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa , put his hands in his trouser pockets , pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat , and , with look of determination , walked towards gregor .
he probably did not even know himself what he had in mind , but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high .
gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots , but wasted no time with that  he knew full well , right from the first day of his new life , that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him .
and so he ran up to his father , stopped when his father stopped , scurried forwards again when he moved , even slightly .
in this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening , without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly .
gregor remained all this time on the floor , largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling .
whatever he did , gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long , as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements .
he became noticeably short of breath , even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable .
now , as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open ; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running ; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although , here , they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions  then , right beside him , lightly tossed , something flew down and rolled in front of him .
it was an apple ; then another one immediately flew at him ; gregor froze in shock ; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him .
he had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now , without even taking the time for careful aim , threw one apple after another .
these little , red apples rolled about on the floor , knocking into each other as if they had electric motors .
an apple thrown without much force glanced against gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm .
another one however , immediately following it , hit squarely and lodged in his back ; gregor wanted to drag himself away , as if he could remove the surprising , the incredible pain by changing his position ; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out , all his senses in confusion .
the last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open , his sister was screaming , his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe , she ran to his father , her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground , stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father , her arms around him , uniting herself with him totally  now gregor lost his ability to see anything  her hands behind his father's head begging him to spare gregor's life .
noone dared to remove the apple lodged in gregor's flesh , so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury .
he had suffered it there for more than a month , and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that gregor , despite his current sad and revolting form , was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy .
on the contrary , as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient , just to be patient .
because of his injuries , gregor had lost much of his mobility  probably permanently .
he had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long , long minutes to crawl across his room  crawling over the ceiling was out of the question  but this deterioration in his condition was fully in his opinion made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening .
he got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then , lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room , he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation  with everyone's permission , in a way , and thus quite differently from before .
they no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times , of course , the ones that gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room .
all of them were usually very quiet nowadays .
soon after dinner , his father would go to sleep in his chair ; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet ; his mother , bent deeply under the lamp , would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop ; his sister , who had taken a sales job , learned shorthand and french in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on .
sometimes his father would wake up and say to gregor's mother you're doing so much sewing again today !
 ,as if he did not know that he had been dozing  and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin .
with a kind of stubbornness , gregor's father refused to take his uniform off even at home ; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg gregor's father would slumber where he was , fully dressed , as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here .
the uniform had not been new to start with , but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of gregor's mother and sister to look after it .
gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat , with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny , while the old man in it would sleep , highly uncomfortable but peaceful .
as soon as it struck ten , gregor's mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed , as he couldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work .
but since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table , even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed .
then , however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up .
gregor's mother would tug at his sleeve , whisper endearments into his ear , gregor's sister would leave her work to help her mother , but nothing would have any effect on him .
he would just sink deeper into his chair .
only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes , look at them one after the other and say : what a life !
this is what peace i get in my old age !
and supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself , let the women take him to the door , send them off and carry on by himself while gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him .
who , in this tired and overworked family , would have had time to give more attention to gregor than was absolutely necessary ?
the household budget became even smaller ; so now the maid was dismissed ; an enormous , thickboned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work ; everything else was looked after by gregor's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did .
gregor even learned , listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for , that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold , even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations .
but the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances , they could not move out of it , there was no imaginable way of transferring gregor to the new address .
he could see quite well , though , that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move , it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it ; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair , and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to .
they carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people , gregor's father brought bank employees their breakfast , his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers , his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers , but they just did not have the strength to do any more .
and the injury in gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new .
after they had come back from taking his father to bed gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together , cheek to cheek ; his mother would point to gregor's room and say close that door , grete , and then , when he was in the dark again , they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle , or they would simply sit there staring dryeyed at the table .
gregor hardly slept at all , either night or day .
sometimes he would think of taking over the family's affairs , just like before , the next time the door was opened ; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk , but they would appear again in his thoughts , the salesmen and the apprentices , that stupid teaboy , two or three friends from other businesses , one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel , a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again , a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow ,  all of them appeared to him , mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten , but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible , and he was glad when they disappeared .
other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family , he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown , and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted , he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to , even if he was not hungry .
gregor's sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday , and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom , indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or  more often than not  had been left totally untouched .
she still cleared up the room in the evening , but now she could not have been any quicker about it .
smears of dirt were left on the walls , here and there were little balls of dust and filth .
at first , gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her , but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it ; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it .
at the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood  cleaning up gregor's room was for her and her alone .
gregor's mother did once thoroughly clean his room , and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it  although that much dampness also made gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch , bitter and immobile .
but his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done , as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in gregor's room and , highly aggrieved , ran back into the living room where , despite her mothers raised and imploring hands , she broke into convulsive tears .
her father , of course , was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless ; then they , too , became agitated ; gregor's father , standing to the right of his mother , accused her of not leaving the cleaning of gregor's room to his sister ; from her left , gregor's sister screamed at her that she was never to clean gregor's room again ; while his mother tried to draw his father , who was beside himself with anger , into the bedroom ; his sister , quaking with tears , thumped on the table with her small fists ; and gregor hissed in anger that noone had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise .
gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work , and looking after gregor as she had done before was even more work for her , but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place .
gregor , on the other hand , ought not to be neglected .
now , though , the charwoman was here .
this elderly widow , with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life , wasn't really repelled by gregor .
just by chance one day , rather than any real curiosity , she opened the door to gregor's room and found herself face to face with him .
he was taken totally by surprise , noone was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her .
from then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him .
at first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly , such as come on then , you old dungbeetle !
 ,or look at the old dungbeetle there !
gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way , but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened .
if only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it !
one day , early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes , perhaps indicating that spring was coming , she began to speak to him in that way once again .
gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her , he was slow and infirm , but it was like a kind of attack .
instead of being afraid , the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open , clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into gregor's back .
aren't you coming any closer , then ?
 ,she asked when gregor turned round again , and she calmly put the chair back in the corner .
gregor had almost entirely stopped eating .
only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it , leave it there a few hours and then , more often than not , spit it out again .
at first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating , but he had soon got used to the changes made there .
they had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else , and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen .
these earnest gentlemen  all three of them had full beards , as gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day  were painfully insistent on things' being tidy .
this meant not only in their own room but , since they had taken a room in this establishment , in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen .
unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate , especially if it was dirty .
they had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them .
for this reason , many things had become superfluous which , although they could not be sold , the family did not wish to discard .
all these things found their way into gregor's room .
the dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too .
the charwoman was always in a hurry , and anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in there .
he , fortunately , would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it .
the woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity , or to throw everything out in one go , but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else .
at first he moved it because , with no other room free where he could crawl about , he was forced to , but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death , and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards .
the gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone , and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening .
but gregor found it easy to give up having the door open , he had , after all , often failed to make use of it when it was open and , without the family having noticed it , lain in his room in its darkest corner .
one time , though , the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open , and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on .
they sat up at the table where , formerly , gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother , they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks .
gregor's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes .
the food was steaming , and filled the room with its smell .
the gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it , and the gentleman in the middle , who seemed to count as an authority for the other two , did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish , clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen .
it was to his satisfaction , and gregor's mother and sister , who had been looking on anxiously , began to breathe again and smiled .
the family themselves ate in the kitchen .
nonetheless , gregor's father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen , bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table .
the gentlemen stood as one , and mumbled something into their beards .
then , once they were alone , they ate in near perfect silence .
it seemed remarkable to gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard , as if they had wanted to show gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be .
i'd like to eat something , said gregor anxiously , but not anything like they're eating .
they do feed themselves .
and here i am , dying !
throughout all this time , gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played , but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen .
the three gentlemen had already finished their meal , the one in the middle had produced a newspaper , given a page to each of the others , and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking .
when the violin began playing they became attentive , stood up and went on tiptoe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other .
someone must have heard them in the kitchen , as gregor's father called out : is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen ?
we can stop it straight away .
on the contrary , said the middle gentleman , would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room , where it is , after all , much more cosy and comfortable ?
oh yes , we'd love to , called back gregor's father as if he had been the violin player himself .
the gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited .
gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand , his mother with the music and his sister with the violin .
she calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing ; his parents , who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen , did not even dare to sit on their own chairs ; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat ; his mother , though , was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat  leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it  out of the way in a corner .
his sister began to play ; father and mother paid close attention , one on each side , to the movements of her hands .
drawn in by the playing , gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room .
before , he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others .
what's more , there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement ; he carried threads , hairs , and remains of food about on his back and sides ; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day .
and despite this condition , he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room .
noone noticed him , though .
the family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing ; at first , the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played , and they must have disturbed gregor's sister , but soon , in contrast with the family , they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume , and they stayed by the window while gregor's father observed them anxiously .
it really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed , that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed .
it was especially unnerving , the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses .
yet gregor's sister was playing so beautifully .
her face was leant to one side , following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression .
gregor crawled a little further forward , keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came .
was he an animal if music could captivate him so ?
it seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for .
he was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin , as noone appreciated her playing here as much as he would .
he never wanted to let her out of his room , not while he lived , anyway ; his shocking appearance should , for once , be of some use to him ; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers ; his sister should not be forced to stay with him , though , but stay of her own free will ; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory , how he would have told everyone about it last christmas  had christmas really come and gone already ?
 if this misfortune hadn't got in the way , and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it .
on hearing all this , his sister would break out in tears of emotion , and gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck , which , since she had been going out to work , she had kept free without any necklace or collar .
mr .
samsa !
 ,shouted the middle gentleman to gregor's father , pointing , without wasting any more words , with his forefinger at gregor as he slowly moved forward .
the violin went silent , the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends , shaking his head , and then looked back at gregor .
his father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving gregor out , even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been .
he rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of gregor with his body .
now they did become a little annoyed , and it was not clear whether it was his father's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like gregor in the next room without knowing it .
they asked gregor's father for explanations , raised their arms like he had , tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly .
meanwhile gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted .
she had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing , but then she suddenly pulled herself together , lay the instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was , and ran into the next room which , under pressure from her father , the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward .
under his sister's experienced hand , the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room .
gregor's father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants .
he urged them and pressed them until , when he was already at the door of the room , the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought gregor's father to a halt .
i declare here and now , he said , raising his hand and glancing at gregor's mother and sister to gain their attention too , that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family  here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor  i give immediate notice on my room .
for the days that i have been living here i will , of course , pay nothing at all , on the contrary i will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you , and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action .
he was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something .
and indeed , his two friends joined in with the words : and we also give immediate notice .
with that , he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door .
gregor's father staggered back to his seat , feeling his way with his hands , and fell into it ; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all .
throughout all this , gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him .
his disappointment at the failure of his plan , and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger , made it impossible for him to move .
he was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment , and he waited .
he was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor .
father , mother , said his sister , hitting the table with her hand as introduction , we can't carry on like this .
maybe you can't see it , but i can .
i don't want to call this monster my brother , all i can say is : we have to try and get rid of it .
we've done all that's humanly possible to look after it and be patient , i don't think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong .
she's absolutely right , said gregor's father to himself .
his mother , who still had not had time to catch her breath , began to cough dully , her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes .
gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead .
her words seemed to give gregor's father some more definite ideas .
he sat upright , played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal , and occasionally looked down at gregor as he lay there immobile .
we have to try and get rid of it , said gregor's sister , now speaking only to her father , as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen , it'll be the death of both of you , i can see it coming .
we can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this , we can't endure it .
i can't endure it any more .
and she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother , and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements .
my child , said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding , what are we to do ?
his sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her , displacing her earlier certainty .
if he could just understand us , said his father almost as a question ; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question .
if he could just understand us , repeated gregor's father , closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite impossible , then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him .
but as it is  .
 .
 .
it's got to go , shouted his sister , that's the only way , father .
you've got to get rid of the idea that that's gregor .
we've only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long .
how can that be gregor ?
if it were gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will .
we wouldn't have a brother any more , then , but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect .
as it is this animal is persecuting us , it's driven out our tenants , it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets .
father , look , just look , she suddenly screamed , he's starting again !
in her alarm , which was totally beyond gregor's comprehension , his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near gregor .
she rushed over to behind her father , who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of gregor's sister as if to protect her .
but gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone , least of all his sister .
all he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room , although that was in itself quite startling as his painwracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it , repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor .
he stopped and looked round .
they seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly .
now they all looked at him in unhappy silence .
his mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other , her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion ; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck .
maybe now they'll let me turn round , thought gregor and went back to work .
he could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest .
noone was making him rush any more , everything was left up to him .
as soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead .
he was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room , and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it .
he concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word , not any cry , from his family to distract him .
he did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway .
he did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff , but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed , only his sister had stood up .
with his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep .
he was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut , bolted and locked .
the sudden noise behind gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him .
it was his sister who had been in so much of a rush .
she had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly , gregor had not heard her coming at all , and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents at last !
 .
what now , then ?
 ,gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness .
he soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all .
this was no surprise to him , it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural .
he also felt relatively comfortable .
it is true that his entire body was aching , but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether .
he could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it , which was entirely covered in white dust .
he thought back of his family with emotion and love .
if it was possible , he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister .
he remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning .
he watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too .
then , without his willing it , his head sank down completely , and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils .
when the cleaner came in early in the morning  they'd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did , so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace  she made her usual brief look in on gregor and at first found nothing special .
she thought he was laying there so still on purpose , playing the martyr ; she attributed all possible understanding to him .
she happened to be holding the long broom in her hand , so she tried to tickle gregor with it from the doorway .
when she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little , and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention .
she soon realised what had really happened , opened her eyes wide , whistled to herself , but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms : come and 'ave a look at this , it's dead , just lying there , stone dead !
mr. and mrs. samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying .
but then , each from his own side , they hurried out of bed .
mr. samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders , mrs. samsa just came out in her nightdress ; and that is how they went into gregor's room .
on the way they opened the door to the living room where grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in ; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep , and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this .
dead ?
 ,asked mrs. samsa , looking at the charwoman enquiringly , even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking .
that's what i said , replied the cleaner , and to prove it she gave gregor's body another shove with the broom , sending it sideways across the floor .
mrs. samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom , but did not complete it .
now then , said mr. samsa , let's give thanks to god for that .
he crossed himself , and the three women followed his example .
grete , who had not taken her eyes from the corpse , said : just look how thin he was .
he didn't eat anything for so long .
the food came out again just the same as when it went in .
gregor's body was indeed completely dried up and flat , they had not seen it until then , but now he was not lifted up on his little legs , nor did he do anything to make them look away .
grete , come with us in here for a little while , said mrs. samsa with a pained smile , and grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body .
the cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide .
although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it .
it was already the end of march , after all .
the three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts ; they had been forgotten about .
where is our breakfast ?
 ,the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably .
she just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into gregor's room .
they did so , and stood around gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their wellworn coats .
it was now quite light in the room .
then the door of the bedroom opened and mr. samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other .
all of them had been crying a little ; grete now and then pressed her face against her father's arm .
leave my home .
now !
 ,said mr. samsa , indicating the door and without letting the women from him .
what do you mean ?
 ,asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted , and he smiled sweetly .
the other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour .
i mean just what i said , answered mr. samsa , and , with his two companions , went in a straight line towards the man .
at first , he stood there still , looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions .
alright , we'll go then , he said , and looked up at mr. samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from mr. samsa for his decision .
mr. samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times .
at that , and without delay , the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway ; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said .
now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that mr. samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader .
once there , all three took their hats from the stand , took their sticks from the holder , bowed without a word and left the premises .
mr. samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing ; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps .
as they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later ; the further down they went , the more that the samsa family lost interest in them ; when a butcher's boy , proud of posture with his tray on his head , passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were , mr. samsa and the women came away from the landing and went , as if relieved , back into the flat .
they decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk ; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it .
so they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal , mr. samsa to his employers , mrs. samsa to her contractor and grete to her principal .
the cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going , she'd finished her work for that morning .
the three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing , and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation .
well ?
 ,asked mr. samsa .
the charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report , but would only do it if she was clearly asked to .
the almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat , which had been a source of irritation to mr. samsa all the time she had been working for them , swayed gently in all directions .
what is it you want then ?
 ,asked mrs. samsa , whom the cleaner had the most respect for .
yes , she answered , and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away , well then , that thing in there , you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it .
that's all been sorted out .
mrs. samsa and grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing ; mr. samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but , with outstretched hand , he made it quite clear that she was not to .
so , as she was prevented from telling them all about it , she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and , clearly peeved , called out cheerio then , everyone , turned round sharply and left , slamming the door terribly as she went .
tonight she gets sacked , said mr. samsa , but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained .
they got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other .
mr. samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while .
then he called out : come here , then .
let's forget about all that old stuff , shall we .
come and give me a bit of attention .
the two women immediately did as he said , hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters .
after that , the three of them left the flat together , which was something they had not done for months , and took the tram out to the open country outside the town .
they had the tram , filled with warm sunshine , all to themselves .
leant back comfortably on their seats , they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad  until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future .
the greatest improvement for the time being , of course , would be achieved quite easily by moving house ; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by gregor , one that was in a better location and , most of all , more practical .
all the time , grete was becoming livelier .
with all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale , but , while they were talking , mr. and mrs. samsa were struck , almost simultaneously , with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady .
they became quieter .
just from each other's glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her .
and , as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions , as soon as they reached their destination grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body .
