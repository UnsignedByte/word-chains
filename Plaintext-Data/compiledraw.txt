you don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer ;  but that ain't no matter .
that book was made by mr. mark twain ,  and he told the truth ,  mainly .
there was things which he stretched ,  but mainly he told the truth .
that is nothing .
i never seen anybody but lied one time or another ,  without it was aunt polly ,  or the widow ,  or maybe mary .
aunt pollytom's aunt polly ,  she isand mary ,  and the widow douglas is all told about in that book ,  which is mostly a true book ,  with some stretchers ,  as i said before .
now the way that the book winds up is this :  tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave ,  and it made us rich .
we got six thousand dollars apieceall gold .
it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up .
well ,  judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest ,  and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year roundmore than a body could tell what to do with .
the widow douglas she took me for her son ,  and allowed she would sivilize me ;  but it was rough living in the house all the time ,  considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ;  and so when i couldn't stand it no longer i lit out .
i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again ,  and was free and satisfied .
but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers ,  and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable .
so i went back .
the widow she cried over me ,  and called me a poor lost lamb ,  and she called me a lot of other names ,  too ,  but she never meant no harm by it .
she put me in them new clothes again ,  and i couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat ,  and feel all cramped up .
well ,  then ,  the old thing commenced again .
the widow rung a bell for supper ,  and you had to come to time .
when you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating ,  but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals ,  though there warn't really anything the matter with them , that is ,  nothing only everything was cooked by itself .
in a barrel of odds and ends it is different ;  things get mixed up ,  and the juice kind of swaps around ,  and the things go better .
after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers ,  and i was in a sweat to find out all about him ;  but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time ;  so then i didn't care no more about him ,  because i don't take no stock in dead people .
pretty soon i wanted to smoke ,  and asked the widow to let me .
but she wouldn't .
she said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean ,  and i must try to not do it any more .
that is just the way with some people .
they get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it .
here she was abothering about moses ,  which was no kin to her ,  and no use to anybody ,  being gone ,  you see ,  yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it .
and she took snuff ,  too ;  of course that was all right ,  because she done it herself .
her sister ,  miss watson ,  a tolerable slim old maid ,  with goggles on ,  had just come to live with her ,  and took a set at me now with a spellingbook .
she worked me middling hard for about an hour ,  and then the widow made her ease up .
i couldn't stood it much longer .
then for an hour it was deadly dull ,  and i was fidgety .
miss watson would say ,  don't put your feet up there ,  huckleberry ;  and don't scrunch up like that ,  huckleberryset up straight ;  and pretty soon she would say ,  don't gap and stretch like that ,  huckleberrywhy don't you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place ,  and i said i wished i was there .
she got mad then ,  but i didn't mean no harm .
all i wanted was to go somewheres ;  all i wanted was a change ,  i warn't particular .
she said it was wicked to say what i said ;  said she wouldn't say it for the whole world ;  she was going to live so as to go to the good place .
well ,  i couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going ,  so i made up my mind i wouldn't try for it .
but i never said so ,  because it would only make trouble ,  and wouldn't do no good .
now she had got a start ,  and she went on and told me all about the good place .
she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing ,  forever and ever .
so i didn't think much of it .
but i never said so .
i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there ,  and she said not by a considerable sight .
i was glad about that ,  because i wanted him and me to be together .
miss watson she kept pecking at me ,  and it got tiresome and lonesome .
by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers ,  and then everybody was off to bed .
i went up to my room with a piece of candle ,  and put it on the table .
then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful ,  but it warn't no use .
i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead .
the stars were shining ,  and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ;  and i heard an owl ,  away off ,  whowhooing about somebody that was dead ,  and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ;  and the wind was trying to whisper something to me ,  and i couldn't make out what it was ,  and so it made the cold shivers run over me .
then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood ,  and so can't rest easy in its grave ,  and has to go about that way every night grieving .
i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had some company .
pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder ,  and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle ;  and before i could budge it was all shriveled up .
i didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck ,  so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me .
i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ;  and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away .
but i hadn't no confidence .
you do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found ,  instead of nailing it up over the door ,  but i hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider .
i set down again ,  ashaking all over ,  and got out my pipe for a smoke ;  for the house was all as still as death now ,  and so the widow wouldn't know .
well ,  after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelve licks ;  and all still againstiller than ever .
pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessomething was a stirring .
i set still and listened .
directly i could just barely hear a meyow !
meyow down there .
that was good !
says i ,  meyow !
meyow as soft as i could ,  and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed .
then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees ,  and ,  sure enough ,  there was tom sawyer waiting for me .
we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden ,  stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads .
when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise .
we scrouched down and laid still .
miss watson's big nigger ,  named jim ,  was setting in the kitchen door ;  we could see him pretty clear ,  because there was a light behind him .
he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute ,  listening .
then he says :  who dah he listened some more ;  then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ;  we could a touched him ,  nearly .
well ,  likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound ,  and we all there so close together .
there was a place on my ankle that got to itching ,  but i dasn't scratch it ;  and then my ear begun to itch ;  and next my back ,  right between my shoulders .
seemed like i'd die if i couldn't scratch .
well ,  i've noticed that thing plenty times since .
if you are with the quality ,  or at a funeral ,  or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepyif you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch ,  why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places .
pretty soon jim says :  say ,  who is you ?
whar is you ?
dog my cats ef i didn' hear sumf'n .
well ,  i know what i's gwyne to do :  i's gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom .
he leaned his back up against a tree ,  and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine .
my nose begun to itch .
it itched till the tears come into my eyes .
but i dasn't scratch .
then it begun to itch on the inside .
next i got to itching underneath .
i didn't know how i was going to set still .
this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ;  but it seemed a sight longer than that .
i was itching in eleven different places now .
i reckoned i couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer ,  but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try .
just then jim begun to breathe heavy ;  next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again .
tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees .
when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me ,  and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun .
but i said no ;  he might wake and make a disturbance ,  and then they'd find out i warn't in .
then tom said he hadn't got candles enough ,  and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more .
i didn't want him to try .
i said jim might wake up and come .
but tom wanted to resk it ;  so we slid in there and got three candles ,  and tom laid five cents on the table for pay .
then we got out ,  and i was in a sweat to get away ;  but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was ,  on his hands and knees ,  and play something on him .
i waited ,  and it seemed a good while ,  everything was so still and lonesome .
as soon as tom was back we cut along the path ,  around the garden fence ,  and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house .
tom said he slipped jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him ,  and jim stirred a little ,  but he didn't wake .
afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance ,  and rode him all over the state ,  and then set him under the trees again ,  and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it .
and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans ;  and ,  after that ,  every time he told it he spread it more and more ,  till by and by he said they rode him all over the world ,  and tired him most to death ,  and his back was all over saddleboils .
jim was monstrous proud about it ,  and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers .
niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it ,  and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country .
strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over ,  same as if he was a wonder .
niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ;  but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things ,  jim would happen in and say ,  hm !
what you know 'bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat .
jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string ,  and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands ,  and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ;  but he never told what it was he said to it .
niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had ,  just for a sight of that fivecenter piece ;  but they wouldn't touch it ,  because the devil had had his hands on it .
jim was most ruined for a servant ,  because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches .
well ,  when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling ,  where there was sick folks ,  maybe ;  and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ;  and down by the village was the river ,  a whole mile broad ,  and awful still and grand .
we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers ,  and two or three more of the boys ,  hid in the old tanyard .
so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half ,  to the big scar on the hillside ,  and went ashore .
we went to a clump of bushes ,  and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret ,  and then showed them a hole in the hill ,  right in the thickest part of the bushes .
then we lit the candles ,  and crawled in on our hands and knees .
we went about two hundred yards ,  and then the cave opened up .
tom poked about amongst the passages ,  and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole .
we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room ,  all damp and sweaty and cold ,  and there we stopped .
tom says :  now ,  we'll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer's gang .
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath ,  and write his name in blood everybody was willing .
so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on ,  and read it .
it swore every boy to stick to the band ,  and never tell any of the secrets ;  and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band ,  whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it ,  and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts ,  which was the sign of the band .
and nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark ,  and if he did he must be sued ;  and if he done it again he must be killed .
and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets ,  he must have his throat cut ,  and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around ,  and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang ,  but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever .
everybody said it was a real beautiful oath ,  and asked tom if he got it out of his own head .
he said ,  some of it ,  but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks ,  and every gang that was hightoned had it .
some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets .
tom said it was a good idea ,  so he took a pencil and wrote it in .
then ben rogers says :  here's huck finn ,  he hain't got no family ;  what you going to do 'bout him well ,  hain't he got a father says tom sawyer .
yes ,  he's got a father ,  but you can't never find him these days .
he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard ,  but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more they talked it over ,  and they was going to rule me out ,  because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill ,  or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others .
well ,  nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped ,  and set still .
i was most ready to cry ;  but all at once i thought of a way ,  and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her .
everybody said :  oh ,  she'll do .
that's all right .
huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with ,  and i made my mark on the paper .
now ,  says ben rogers ,  what's the line of business of this gang nothing only robbery and murder ,  tom said .
but who are we going to robhouses ,  or cattle ,  or stuff !
stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery ;  it's burglary ,  says tom sawyer .
we ain't burglars .
that ain't no sort of style .
we are highwaymen .
we stop stages and carriages on the road ,  with masks on ,  and kill the people and take their watches and money must we always kill the people oh ,  certainly .
it's best .
some authorities think different ,  but mostly it's considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here ,  and keep them till they're ransomed ransomed ?
what's that i don't know .
but that's what they do .
i've seen it in books ;  and so of course that's what we've got to do but how can we do it if we don't know what it is why ,  blame it all ,  we've got to do it .
don't i tell you it's in the books ?
do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books ,  and get things all muddled up oh ,  that's all very fine to say ,  tom sawyer ,  but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to themthat's the thing i want to get at .
now ,  what do you reckon it is well ,  i don't know .
but per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed ,  it means that we keep them till they're dead now ,  that's something like .
that'll answer .
why couldn't you said that before ?
we'll keep them till they're ransomed to death ;  and a bothersome lot they'll be ,  tooeating up everything ,  and always trying to get loose how you talk ,  ben rogers .
how can they get loose when there's a guard over them ,  ready to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard !
well ,  that is good .
so somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep ,  just so as to watch them .
i think that's foolishness .
why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here because it ain't in the books sothat's why .
now ,  ben rogers ,  do you want to do things regular ,  or don't youthat's the idea .
don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do ?
do you reckon you can learn 'em anything ?
not by a good deal .
no ,  sir ,  we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right .
i don't mind ;  but i say it's a fool way ,  anyhow .
say ,  do we kill the women ,  too well ,  ben rogers ,  if i was as ignorant as you i wouldn't let on .
kill the women ?
no ;  nobody ever saw anything in the books like that .
you fetch them to the cave ,  and you're always as polite as pie to them ;  and by and by they fall in love with you ,  and never want to go home any more well ,  if that's the way i'm agreed ,  but i don't take no stock in it .
mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women ,  and fellows waiting to be ransomed ,  that there won't be no place for the robbers .
but go ahead ,  i ain't got nothing to say little tommy barnes was asleep now ,  and when they waked him up he was scared ,  and cried ,  and said he wanted to go home to his ma ,  and didn't want to be a robber any more .
so they all made fun of him ,  and called him crybaby ,  and that made him mad ,  and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets .
but tom give him five cents to keep quiet ,  and said we would all go home and meet next week ,  and rob somebody and kill some people .
ben rogers said he couldn't get out much ,  only sundays ,  and so he wanted to begin next sunday ;  but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday ,  and that settled the thing .
they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could ,  and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang ,  and so started home .
i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking .
my new clothes was all greased up and clayey ,  and i was dogtired .
well ,  i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes ;  but the widow she didn't scold ,  but only cleaned off the grease and clay ,  and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could .
then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed ,  but nothing come of it .
she told me to pray every day ,  and whatever i asked for i would get it .
but it warn't so .
i tried it .
once i got a fishline ,  but no hooks .
it warn't any good to me without hooks .
i tried for the hooks three or four times ,  but somehow i couldn't make it work .
by and by ,  one day ,  i asked miss watson to try for me ,  but she said i was a fool .
she never told me why ,  and i couldn't make it out no way .
i set down one time back in the woods ,  and had a long think about it .
i says to myself ,  if a body can get anything they pray for ,  why don't deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork ?
why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ?
why can't miss watson fat up ?
no ,  says i to my self ,  there ain't nothing in it .
i went and told the widow about it ,  and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me ,  but she told me what she meanti must help other people ,  and do everything i could for other people ,  and look out for them all the time ,  and never think about myself .
this was including miss watson ,  as i took it .
i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time ,  but i couldn't see no advantage about itexcept for the other people ;  so at last i reckoned i wouldn't worry about it any more ,  but just let it go .
sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water ;  but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again .
i judged i could see that there was two providences ,  and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence ,  but if miss watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more .
i thought it all out ,  and reckoned i would belong to the widow's if he wanted me ,  though i couldn't make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before ,  seeing i was so ignorant ,  and so kind of lowdown and ornery .
pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year ,  and that was comfortable for me ;  i didn't want to see him no more .
he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ;  though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around .
well ,  about this time he was found in the river drownded ,  about twelve mile above town ,  so people said .
they judged it was him ,  anyway ;  said this drownded man was just his size ,  and was ragged ,  and had uncommon long hair ,  which was all like pap ;  but they couldn't make nothing out of the face ,  because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all .
they said he was floating on his back in the water .
they took him and buried him on the bank .
but i warn't comfortable long ,  because i happened to think of something .
i knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back ,  but on his face .
so i knowed ,  then ,  that this warn't pap ,  but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes .
so i was uncomfortable again .
i judged the old man would turn up again by and by ,  though i wished he wouldn't .
we played robber now and then about a month ,  and then i resigned .
all the boys did .
we hadn't robbed nobody ,  hadn't killed any people ,  but only just pretended .
we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market ,  but we never hived any of them .
tom sawyer called the hogs ingots ,  and he called the turnips and stuff julery ,  and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done ,  and how many people we had killed and marked .
but i couldn't see no profit in it .
one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick ,  which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together ,  and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants ,  and six hundred camels ,  and over a thousand sumter mules ,  all loaded down with di'monds ,  and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers ,  and so we would lay in ambuscade ,  as he called it ,  and kill the lot and scoop the things .
he said we must slick up our swords and guns ,  and get ready .
he never could go after even a turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it ,  though they was only lath and broomsticks ,  and you might scour at them till you rotted ,  and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before .
i didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and arabs ,  but i wanted to see the camels and elephants ,  so i was on hand next day ,  saturday ,  in the ambuscade ;  and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
but there warn't no spaniards and arabs ,  and there warn't no camels nor no elephants .
it warn't anything but a sundayschool picnic ,  and only a primerclass at that .
we busted it up ,  and chased the children up the hollow ;  but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam ,  though ben rogers got a rag doll ,  and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract ;  and then the teacher charged in ,  and made us drop everything and cut .
i didn't see no di'monds ,  and i told tom sawyer so .
he said there was loads of them there ,  anyway ;  and he said there was arabs there ,  too ,  and elephants and things .
i said ,  why couldn't we see them ,  then ?
he said if i warn't so ignorant ,  but had read a book called don quixote ,  i would know without asking .
he said it was all done by enchantment .
he said there was hundreds of soldiers there ,  and elephants and treasure ,  and so on ,  but we had enemies which he called magicians ;  and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool ,  just out of spite .
i said ,  all right ;  then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians .
tom sawyer said i was a numskull .
why ,  said he ,  a magician could call up a lot of genies ,  and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson .
they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well ,  i says ,  s'pose we got some genies to help uscan't we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i don't know .
how do they get them why ,  they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring ,  and then the genies come tearing in ,  with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke arolling ,  and everything they're told to do they up and do it .
they don't think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots ,  and belting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man who makes them tear around so why ,  whoever rubs the lamp or the ring .
they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring ,  and they've got to do whatever he says .
if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds ,  and fill it full of chewinggum ,  or whatever you want ,  and fetch an emperor's daughter from china for you to marry ,  they've got to do itand they've got to do it before sunup next morning ,  too .
and more :  they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it ,  you understand well ,  says i ,  i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that .
and what's moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk ,  huck finn .
why ,  you'd have to come when he rubbed it ,  whether you wanted to or not what !
and i as high as a tree and as big as a church ?
all right ,  then ;  i would come ;  but i lay i'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks ,  it ain't no use to talk to you ,  huck finn .
you don't seem to know anything ,  somehowperfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days ,  and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it .
i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring ,  and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun ,  calculating to build a palace and sell it ;  but it warn't no use ,  none of the genies come .
so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyer's lies .
i reckoned he believed in the arabs and the elephants ,  but as for me i think different .
it had all the marks of a sundayschool .
well ,  three or four months run along ,  and it was well into the winter now .
i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little ,  and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirtyfive ,  and i don't reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever .
i don't take no stock in mathematics ,  anyway .
at first i hated the school ,  but by and by i got so i could stand it .
whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey ,  and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up .
so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be .
i was getting sort of used to the widow's ways ,  too ,  and they warn't so raspy on me .
living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly ,  but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes ,  and so that was a rest to me .
i liked the old ways best ,  but i was getting so i liked the new ones ,  too ,  a little bit .
the widow said i was coming along slow but sure ,  and doing very satisfactory .
she said she warn't ashamed of me .
one morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast .
i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck ,  but miss watson was in ahead of me ,  and crossed me off .
she says ,  take your hands away ,  huckleberry ;  what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me ,  but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck ,  i knowed that well enough .
i started out ,  after breakfast ,  feeling worried and shaky ,  and wondering where it was going to fall on me ,  and what it was going to be .
there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck ,  but this wasn't one of them kind ;  so i never tried to do anything ,  but just poked along lowspirited and on the watchout .
i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence .
there was an inch of new snow on the ground ,  and i seen somebody's tracks .
they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while ,  and then went on around the garden fence .
it was funny they hadn't come in ,  after standing around so .
i couldn't make it out .
it was very curious ,  somehow .
i was going to follow around ,  but i stooped down to look at the tracks first .
i didn't notice anything at first ,  but next i did .
there was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails ,  to keep off the devil .
i was up in a second and shinning down the hill .
i looked over my shoulder every now and then ,  but i didn't see nobody .
i was at judge thatcher's as quick as i could get there .
he said :  why ,  my boy ,  you are all out of breath .
did you come for your interest no ,  sir ,  i says ;  is there some for me oh ,  yes ,  a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty dollars .
quite a fortune for you .
you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand ,  because if you take it you'll spend it no ,  sir ,  i says ,  i don't want to spend it .
i don't want it at allnor the six thousand ,  nuther .
i want you to take it ;  i want to give it to youthe six thousand and all he looked surprised .
he couldn't seem to make it out .
he says :  why ,  what can you mean ,  my boy i says ,  don't you ask me no questions about it ,  please .
you'll take itwon't you he says :  well ,  i'm puzzled .
is something the matter please take it ,  says i ,  and don't ask me nothingthen i won't have to tell no lies he studied a while ,  and then he says :  ohoo !
i think i see .
you want to sell all your property to menot give it .
that's the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over ,  and says :  there ;  you see it says 'for a consideration' that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it .
here's a dollar for you .
now you sign it so i signed it ,  and left .
miss watson's nigger ,  jim ,  had a hairball as big as your fist ,  which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox ,  and he used to do magic with it .
he said there was a spirit inside of it ,  and it knowed everything .
so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again ,  for i found his tracks in the snow .
what i wanted to know was ,  what he was going to do ,  and was he going to stay ?
jim got out his hairball and said something over it ,  and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor .
it fell pretty solid ,  and only rolled about an inch .
jim tried it again ,  and then another time ,  and it acted just the same .
jim got down on his knees ,  and put his ear against it and listened .
but it warn't no use ;  he said it wouldn't talk .
he said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money .
i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little ,  and it wouldn't pass nohow ,  even if the brass didn't show ,  because it was so slick it felt greasy ,  and so that would tell on it every time .
i reckoned i wouldn't say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money ,  but maybe the hairball would take it ,  because maybe it wouldn't know the difference .
jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it ,  and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good .
he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night ,  and next morning you couldn't see no brass ,  and it wouldn't feel greasy no more ,  and so anybody in town would take it in a minute ,  let alone a hairball .
well ,  i knowed a potato would do that before ,  but i had forgot it .
jim put the quarter under the hairball ,  and got down and listened again .
this time he said the hairball was all right .
he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to .
i says ,  go on .
so the hairball talked to jim ,  and jim told it to me .
he says :  yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's agwyne to do .
sometimes he spec he'll go 'way ,  en den agin he spec he'll stay .
de bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way .
dey's two angels hoverin' roun' 'bout him .
one uv 'em is white en shiny ,  en t'other one is black .
de white one gits him to go right a little while ,  den de black one sail in en bust it all up .
a body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las' .
but you is all right .
you gwyne to have considable trouble in yo' life ,  en considable joy .
sometimes you gwyne to git hurt ,  en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ;  but every time you's gwyne to git well agin .
dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life .
one uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark .
one is rich en t'other is po' .
you's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by .
you wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin ,  en don't run no resk ,  'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self !
i had shut the door to .
then i turned around and there he was .
i used to be scared of him all the time ,  he tanned me so much .
i reckoned i was scared now ,  too ;  but in a minute i see i was mistakenthat is ,  after the first jolt ,  as you may say ,  when my breath sort of hitched ,  he being so unexpected ;  but right away after i see i warn't scared of him worth bothring about .
he was most fifty ,  and he looked it .
his hair was long and tangled and greasy ,  and hung down ,  and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines .
it was all black ,  no gray ;  so was his long ,  mixedup whiskers .
there warn't no color in his face ,  where his face showed ;  it was white ;  not like another man's white ,  but a white to make a body sick ,  a white to make a body's flesh crawla treetoad white ,  a fishbelly white .
as for his clothesjust rags ,  that was all .
he had one ankle resting on t'other knee ;  the boot on that foot was busted ,  and two of his toes stuck through ,  and he worked them now and then .
his hat was laying on the flooran old black slouch with the top caved in ,  like a lid .
i stood alooking at him ;  he set there alooking at me ,  with his chair tilted back a little .
i set the candle down .
i noticed the window was up ;  so he had clumb in by the shed .
he kept alooking me all over .
by and by he says :  starchy clothesvery .
you think you're a good deal of a bigbug ,  don't you maybe i am ,  maybe i ain't ,  i says .
don't you give me none o' your lip ,  says he .
you've put on considerable many frills since i been away .
i'll take you down a peg before i get done with you .
you're educated ,  too ,  they saycan read and write .
you think you're better'n your father ,  now ,  don't you ,  because he can't ?
i'll take it out of you .
who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness ,  heywho told you you could the widow .
she told me the widow ,  heyand who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business nobody never told her well ,  i'll learn her how to meddle .
and looky hereyou drop that school ,  you hear ?
i'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what he is .
you lemme catch you fooling around that school again ,  you hear ?
your mother couldn't read ,  and she couldn't write ,  nuther ,  before she died .
none of the family couldn't before they died .
i can't ;  and here you're aswelling yourself up like this .
i ain't the man to stand ityou hear ?
say ,  lemme hear you read i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars .
when i'd read about a half a minute ,  he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house .
he says :  it's so .
you can do it .
i had my doubts when you told me .
now looky here ;  you stop that putting on frills .
i won't have it .
i'll lay for you ,  my smarty ;  and if i catch you about that school i'll tan you good .
first you know you'll get religion ,  too .
i never see such a son he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy ,  and says :  what's this it's something they give me for learning my lessons good he tore it up ,  and says :  i'll give you something betteri'll give you a cowhide he set there amumbling and agrowling a minute ,  and then he says :  ain't you a sweetscented dandy ,  though ?
a bed ;  and bedclothes ;  and a look'n'glass ;  and a piece of carpet on the floorand your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard .
i never see such a son .
i bet i'll take some o' these frills out o' you before i'm done with you .
why ,  there ain't no end to your airsthey say you're rich .
heyhow's that they liethat's how looky heremind how you talk to me ;  i'm astanding about all i can stand nowso don't gimme no sass .
i've been in town two days ,  and i hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich .
i heard about it away down the river ,  too .
that's why i come .
you git me that money tomorrowi want it i hain't got no money it's a lie .
judge thatcher's got it .
you git it .
i want it i hain't got no money ,  i tell you .
you ask judge thatcher ;  he'll tell you the same all right .
i'll ask him ;  and i'll make him pungle ,  too ,  or i'll know the reason why .
say ,  how much you got in your pocket ?
i want it i hain't got only a dollar ,  and i want that to it don't make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it out he took it and bit it to see if it was good ,  and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ;  said he hadn't had a drink all day .
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again ,  and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ;  and when i reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again ,  and told me to mind about that school ,  because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didn't drop that .
next day he was drunk ,  and he went to judge thatcher's and bullyragged him ,  and tried to make him give up the money ;  but he couldn't ,  and then he swore he'd make the law force him .
the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ;  but it was a new judge that had just come ,  and he didn't know the old man ;  so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it ;  said he'd druther not take a child away from its father .
so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business .
that pleased the old man till he couldn't rest .
he said he'd cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didn't raise some money for him .
i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher ,  and pap took it and got drunk ,  and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ;  and he kept it up all over town ,  with a tin pan ,  till most midnight ;  then they jailed him ,  and next day they had him before court ,  and jailed him again for a week .
but he said he was satisfied ;  said he was boss of his son ,  and he'd make it warm for him .
when he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him .
so he took him to his own house ,  and dressed him up clean and nice ,  and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family ,  and was just old pie to him ,  so to speak .
and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried ,  and said he'd been a fool ,  and fooled away his life ;  but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of ,  and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
the judge said he could hug him for them words ;  so he cried ,  and his wife she cried again ;  pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before ,  and the judge said he believed it .
the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy ,  and the judge said it was so ;  so they cried again .
and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand ,  and says :  look at it ,  gentlemen and ladies all ;  take ahold of it ;  shake it .
there's a hand that was the hand of a hog ;  but it ain't so no more ;  it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life ,  and'll die before he'll go back .
you mark them wordsdon't forget i said them .
it's a clean hand now ;  shake itdon't be afeard so they shook it ,  one after the other ,  all around ,  and cried .
the judge's wife she kissed it .
then the old man he signed a pledgemade his mark .
the judge said it was the holiest time on record ,  or something like that .
then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room ,  which was the spare room ,  and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod ,  and clumb back again and had a good old time ;  and towards daylight he crawled out again ,  drunk as a fiddler ,  and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places ,  and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup .
and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it .
the judge he felt kind of sore .
he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun ,  maybe ,  but he didn't know no other way .
well ,  pretty soon the old man was up and around again ,  and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money ,  and he went for me ,  too ,  for not stopping school .
he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me ,  but i went to school just the same ,  and dodged him or outrun him most of the time .
i didn't want to go to school much before ,  but i reckoned i'd go now to spite pap .
that law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it ;  so every now and then i'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him ,  to keep from getting a cowhiding .
every time he got money he got drunk ;  and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town ;  and every time he raised cain he got jailed .
he was just suitedthis kind of thing was right in his line .
he got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him .
well ,  wasn't he mad ?
he said he would show who was huck finn's boss .
so he watched out for me one day in the spring ,  and catched me ,  and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff ,  and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was .
he kept me with him all the time ,  and i never got a chance to run off .
we lived in that old cabin ,  and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights .
he had a gun which he had stole ,  i reckon ,  and we fished and hunted ,  and that was what we lived on .
every little while he locked me in and went down to the store ,  three miles ,  to the ferry ,  and traded fish and game for whisky ,  and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time ,  and licked me .
the widow she found out where i was by and by ,  and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ;  but pap drove him off with the gun ,  and it warn't long after that till i was used to being where i was ,  and liked itall but the cowhide part .
it was kind of lazy and jolly ,  laying off comfortable all day ,  smoking and fishing ,  and no books nor study .
two months or more run along ,  and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt ,  and i didn't see how i'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's ,  where you had to wash ,  and eat on a plate ,  and comb up ,  and go to bed and get up regular ,  and be forever bothering over a book ,  and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time .
i didn't want to go back no more .
i had stopped cussing ,  because the widow didn't like it ;  but now i took to it again because pap hadn't no objections .
it was pretty good times up in the woods there ,  take it all around .
but by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry ,  and i couldn't stand it .
i was all over welts .
he got to going away so much ,  too ,  and locking me in .
once he locked me in and was gone three days .
it was dreadful lonesome .
i judged he had got drownded ,  and i wasn't ever going to get out any more .
i was scared .
i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there .
i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time ,  but i couldn't find no way .
there warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through .
i couldn't get up the chimbly ;  it was too narrow .
the door was thick ,  solid oak slabs .
pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ;  i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ;  well ,  i was most all the time at it ,  because it was about the only way to put in the time .
but this time i found something at last ;  i found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle ;  it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof .
i greased it up and went to work .
there was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table ,  to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out .
i got under the table and raised the blanket ,  and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through .
well ,  it was a good long job ,  but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap's gun in the woods .
i got rid of the signs of my work ,  and dropped the blanket and hid my saw ,  and pretty soon pap come in .
pap warn't in a good humorso he was his natural self .
he said he was down town ,  and everything was going wrong .
his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ;  but then there was ways to put it off a long time ,  and judge thatcher knowed how to do it .
and he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian ,  and they guessed it would win this time .
this shook me up considerable ,  because i didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized ,  as they called it .
then the old man got to cussing ,  and cussed everything and everybody he could think of ,  and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any ,  and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round ,  including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of ,  and so called them what'shisname when he got to them ,  and went right along with his cussing .
he said he would like to see the widow get me .
he said he would watch out ,  and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in ,  where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me .
that made me pretty uneasy again ,  but only for a minute ;  i reckoned i wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance .
the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got .
there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal ,  and a side of bacon ,  ammunition ,  and a fourgallon jug of whisky ,  and an old book and two newspapers for wadding ,  besides some tow .
i toted up a load ,  and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
i thought it all over ,  and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines ,  and take to the woods when i run away .
i guessed i wouldn't stay in one place ,  but just tramp right across the country ,  mostly night times ,  and hunt and fish to keep alive ,  and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more .
i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough ,  and i reckoned he would .
i got so full of it i didn't notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded .
i got the things all up to the cabin ,  and then it was about dark .
while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up ,  and went to ripping again .
he had been drunk over in town ,  and laid in the gutter all night ,  and he was a sight to look at .
a body would a thought he was adamhe was just all mud .
whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment ,  this time he says :  call this a govment !
why ,  just look at it and see what it's like .
here's the law astanding ready to take a man's son away from hima man's own son ,  which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising .
yes ,  just as that man has got that son raised at last ,  and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for him and give him a rest ,  the law up and goes for him .
and they call that govment !
that ain't all ,  nuther .
the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property .
here's what the law does :  the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards ,  and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this ,  and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog .
they call that govment !
a man can't get his rights in a govment like this .
sometimes i've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all .
yes ,  and i told 'em so ;  i told old thatcher so to his face .
lots of 'em heard me ,  and can tell what i said .
says i ,  for two cents i'd leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin .
them's the very words .
i says look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin ,  and then it ain't rightly a hat at all ,  but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stovepipe .
look at it ,  says isuch a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights .
oh ,  yes ,  this is a wonderful govment ,  wonderful .
why ,  looky here .
there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter ,  most as white as a white man .
he had the whitest shirt on you ever see ,  too ,  and the shiniest hat ;  and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had ;  and he had a gold watch and chain ,  and a silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state .
and what do you think ?
they said he was a p'fessor in a college ,  and could talk all kinds of languages ,  and knowed everything .
and that ain't the wust .
they said he could vote when he was at home .
well ,  that let me out .
thinks i ,  what is the country acoming to ?
it was 'lection day ,  and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warn't too drunk to get there ;  but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote ,  i drawed out .
i says i'll never vote agin .
them's the very words i said ;  they all heard me ;  and the country may rot for all mei'll never vote agin as long as i live .
and to see the cool way of that niggerwhy ,  he wouldn't a give me the road if i hadn't shoved him out o' the way .
i says to the people ,  why ain't this nigger put up at auction and soldthat's what i want to know .
and what do you reckon they said ?
why ,  they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months ,  and he hadn't been there that long yet .
there ,  nowthat's a specimen .
they call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months .
here's a govment that calls itself a govment ,  and lets on to be a govment ,  and thinks it is a govment ,  and yet's got to set stockstill for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling ,  thieving ,  infernal ,  whiteshirted free nigger ,  and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to ,  so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins ,  and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment ,  though he give the tub some ,  too ,  all along ,  here and there .
he hopped around the cabin considerable ,  first on one leg and then on the other ,  holding first one shin and then the other one ,  and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick .
but it warn't good judgment ,  because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ;  so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise ,  and down he went in the dirt ,  and rolled there ,  and held his toes ;  and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous .
he said so his own self afterwards .
he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days ,  and he said it laid over him ,  too ;  but i reckon that was sort of piling it on ,  maybe .
after supper pap took the jug ,  and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens .
that was always his word .
i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour ,  and then i would steal the key ,  or saw myself out ,  one or t'other .
he drank and drank ,  and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ;  but luck didn't run my way .
he didn't go sound asleep ,  but was uneasy .
he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time .
at last i got so sleepy i couldn't keep my eyes open all i could do ,  and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep ,  and the candle burning .
i don't know how long i was asleep ,  but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up .
there was pap looking wild ,  and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes .
he said they was crawling up his legs ;  and then he would give a jump and scream ,  and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldn't see no snakes .
he started and run round and round the cabin ,  hollering take him off !
take him off !
he's biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes .
pretty soon he was all fagged out ,  and fell down panting ;  then he rolled over and over wonderful fast ,  kicking things every which way ,  and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands ,  and screaming and saying there was devils ahold of him .
he wore out by and by ,  and laid still a while ,  moaning .
then he laid stiller ,  and didn't make a sound .
i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods ,  and it seemed terrible still .
he was laying over by the corner .
by and by he raised up part way and listened ,  with his head to one side .
he says ,  very low :  tramptramptramp ;  that's the dead ;  tramptramptramp ;  they're coming after me ;  but i won't go .
oh ,  they're here !
don't touch medon't !
hands offthey're cold ;  let go .
oh ,  let a poor devil alone then he went down on all fours and crawled off ,  begging them to let him alone ,  and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table ,  still abegging ;  and then he went to crying .
i could hear him through the blanket .
by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild ,  and he see me and went for me .
he chased me round and round the place with a claspknife ,  calling me the angel of death ,  and saying he would kill me ,  and then i couldn't come for him no more .
i begged ,  and told him i was only huck ;  but he laughed such a screechy laugh ,  and roared and cussed ,  and kept on chasing me up .
once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders ,  and i thought i was gone ;  but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning ,  and saved myself .
pretty soon he was all tired out ,  and dropped down with his back against the door ,  and said he would rest a minute and then kill me .
he put his knife under him ,  and said he would sleep and get strong ,  and then he would see who was who .
so he dozed off pretty soon .
by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could ,  not to make any noise ,  and got down the gun .
i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded ,  then i laid it across the turnip barrel ,  pointing towards pap ,  and set down behind it to wait for him to stir .
and how slow and still the time did drag along .
git up !
what you 'bout i opened my eyes and looked around ,  trying to make out where i was .
it was after sunup ,  and i had been sound asleep .
pap was standing over me looking sour and sick ,  too .
he says :  what you doin' with this gun i judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing ,  so i says :  somebody tried to get in ,  so i was laying for him why didn't you roust me out well ,  i tried to ,  but i couldn't ;  i couldn't budge you well ,  all right .
don't stand there palavering all day ,  but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast .
i'll be along in a minute he unlocked the door ,  and i cleared out up the riverbank .
i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down ,  and a sprinkling of bark ;  so i knowed the river had begun to rise .
i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town .
the june rise used to be always luck for me ;  because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down ,  and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs together ;  so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill .
i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along .
well ,  all at once here comes a canoe ;  just a beauty ,  too ,  about thirteen or fourteen foot long ,  riding high like a duck .
i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog ,  clothes and all on ,  and struck out for the canoe .
i just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it ,  because people often done that to fool folks ,  and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him .
but it warn't so this time .
it was a driftcanoe sure enough ,  and i clumb in and paddled her ashore .
thinks i ,  the old man will be glad when he sees thisshe's worth ten dollars .
but when i got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet ,  and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully ,  all hung over with vines and willows ,  i struck another idea :  i judged i'd hide her good ,  and then ,  'stead of taking to the woods when i run off ,  i'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good ,  and not have such a rough time tramping on foot .
it was pretty close to the shanty ,  and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time ;  but i got her hid ;  and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows ,  and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun .
so he hadn't seen anything .
when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line .
he abused me a little for being so slow ;  but i told him i fell in the river ,  and that was what made me so long .
i knowed he would see i was wet ,  and then he would be asking questions .
we got five catfish off the lines and went home .
while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up ,  both of us being about wore out ,  i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me ,  it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ;  you see ,  all kinds of things might happen .
well ,  i didn't see no way for a while ,  but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water ,  and he says :  another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out ,  you hear ?
that man warn't here for no good .
i'd a shot him .
next time you roust me out ,  you hear then he dropped down and went to sleep again ;  but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted .
i says to myself ,  i can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me .
about twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank .
the river was coming up pretty fast ,  and lots of driftwood going by on the rise .
by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together .
we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore .
then we had dinner .
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through ,  so as to catch more stuff ;  but that warn't pap's style .
nine logs was enough for one time ;  he must shove right over to town and sell .
so he locked me in and took the skiff ,  and started off towing the raft about halfpast three .
i judged he wouldn't come back that night .
i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start ;  then i out with my saw ,  and went to work on that log again .
before he was t'other side of the river i was out of the hole ;  him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder .
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid ,  and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ;  then i done the same with the side of bacon ;  then the whiskyjug .
i took all the coffee and sugar there was ,  and all the ammunition ;  i took the wadding ;  i took the bucket and gourd ;  i took a dipper and a tin cup ,  and my old saw and two blankets ,  and the skillet and the coffeepot .
i took fishlines and matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent .
i cleaned out the place .
i wanted an axe ,  but there wasn't any ,  only the one out at the woodpile ,  and i knowed why i was going to leave that .
i fetched out the gun ,  and now i was done .
i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things .
so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place ,  which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust .
then i fixed the piece of log back into its place ,  and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there ,  for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground .
if you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed ,  you wouldn't never notice it ;  and besides ,  this was the back of the cabin ,  and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there .
it was all grass clear to the canoe ,  so i hadn't left a track .
i followed around to see .
i stood on the bank and looked out over the river .
all safe .
so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods ,  and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig ;  hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
i shot this fellow and took him into camp .
i took the axe and smashed in the door .
i beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it .
i fetched the pig in ,  and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe ,  and laid him down on the ground to bleed ;  i say ground because it was groundhard packed ,  and no boards .
well ,  next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in itall i could dragand i started it from the pig ,  and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in ,  and down it sunk ,  out of sight .
you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground .
i did wish tom sawyer was there ;  i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business ,  and throw in the fancy touches .
nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that .
well ,  last i pulled out some of my hair ,  and blooded the axe good ,  and stuck it on the back side ,  and slung the axe in the corner .
then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldn't drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
now i thought of something else .
so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe ,  and fetched them to the house .
i took the bag to where it used to stand ,  and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw ,  for there warn't no knives and forks on the placepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking .
then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house ,  to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too ,  you might say ,  in the season .
there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away ,  i don't know where ,  but it didn't go to the river .
the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake .
i dropped pap's whetstone there too ,  so as to look like it had been done by accident .
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string ,  so it wouldn't leak no more ,  and took it and my saw to the canoe again .
it was about dark now ;  so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank ,  and waited for the moon to rise .
i made fast to a willow ;  then i took a bite to eat ,  and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
i says to myself ,  they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me .
and they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things .
they won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass .
they'll soon get tired of that ,  and won't bother no more about me .
all right ;  i can stop anywhere i want to .
jackson's island is good enough for me ;  i know that island pretty well ,  and nobody ever comes there .
and then i can paddle over to town nights ,  and slink around and pick up things i want .
jackson's island's the place .
i was pretty tired ,  and the first thing i knowed i was asleep .
when i woke up i didn't know where i was for a minute .
i set up and looked around ,  a little scared .
then i remembered .
the river looked miles and miles across .
the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went aslipping along ,  black and still ,  hundreds of yards out from shore .
everything was dead quiet ,  and it looked late ,  and smelt late .
you know what i meani don't know the words to put it in .
i took a good gap and a stretch ,  and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water .
i listened .
pretty soon i made it out .
it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night .
i peeped out through the willow branches ,  and there it wasa skiff ,  away across the water .
i couldn't tell how many was in it .
it kept acoming ,  and when it was abreast of me i see there warn't but one man in it .
think's i ,  maybe it's pap ,  though i warn't expecting him .
he dropped below me with the current ,  and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water ,  and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him .
well ,  it was pap ,  sure enoughand sober ,  too ,  by the way he laid his oars .
i didn't lose no time .
the next minute i was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank .
i made two mile and a half ,  and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river ,  because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing ,  and people might see me and hail me .
i got out amongst the driftwood ,  and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float .
i laid there ,  and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe ,  looking away into the sky ;  not a cloud in it .
the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ;  i never knowed it before .
and how far a body can hear on the water such nights !
i heard people talking at the ferry landing .
i heard what they said ,  tooevery word of it .
one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now .
t'other one said this warn't one of the short ones ,  he reckonedand then they laughed ,  and he said it over again ,  and they laughed again ;  then they waked up another fellow and told him ,  and laughed ,  but he didn't laugh ;  he ripped out something brisk ,  and said let him alone .
the first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good ;  but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time .
i heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock ,  and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer .
after that the talk got further and further away ,  and i couldn't make out the words any more ;  but i could hear the mumble ,  and now and then a laugh ,  too ,  but it seemed a long ways off .
i was away below the ferry now .
i rose up ,  and there was jackson's island ,  about two mile and a half down stream ,  heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river ,  big and dark and solid ,  like a steamboat without any lights .
there warn't any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now .
it didn't take me long to get there .
i shot past the head at a ripping rate ,  the current was so swift ,  and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore .
i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about ;  i had to part the willow branches to get in ;  and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside .
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island ,  and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town ,  three mile away ,  where there was three or four lights twinkling .
a monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream ,  coming along down ,  with a lantern in the middle of it .
i watched it come creeping down ,  and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say ,  stern oars ,  there !
heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side .
there was a little gray in the sky now ;  so i stepped into the woods ,  and laid down for a nap before breakfast .
the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight o'clock .
i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things ,  and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied .
i could see the sun out at one or two holes ,  but mostly it was big trees all about ,  and gloomy in there amongst them .
there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves ,  and the freckled places swapped about a little ,  showing there was a little breeze up there .
a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly .
i was powerful lazy and comfortabledidn't want to get up and cook breakfast .
well ,  i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom away up the river .
i rouses up ,  and rests on my elbow and listens ;  pretty soon i hears it again .
i hopped up ,  and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves ,  and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry .
and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down .
i knowed what was the matter now .
boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side .
you see ,  they was firing cannon over the water ,  trying to make my carcass come to the top .
i was pretty hungry ,  but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire ,  because they might see the smoke .
so i set there and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom .
the river was a mile wide there ,  and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat .
well ,  then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off ,  because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there .
so ,  says i ,  i'll keep a lookout ,  and if any of them's floating around after me i'll give them a show .
i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have ,  and i warn't disappointed .
a big double loaf come along ,  and i most got it with a long stick ,  but my foot slipped and she floated out further .
of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei knowed enough for that .
but by and by along comes another one ,  and this time i won .
i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver ,  and set my teeth in .
it was baker's breadwhat the quality eat ;  none of your lowdown cornpone .
i got a good place amongst the leaves ,  and set there on a log ,  munching the bread and watching the ferryboat ,  and very well satisfied .
and then something struck me .
i says ,  now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me ,  and here it has gone and done it .
so there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thingthat is ,  there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays ,  but it don't work for me ,  and i reckon it don't work for only just the right kind .
i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke ,  and went on watching .
the ferryboat was floating with the current ,  and i allowed i'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along ,  because she would come in close ,  where the bread did .
when she'd got pretty well along down towards me ,  i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread ,  and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
where the log forked i could peep through .
by and by she come along ,  and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore .
most everybody was on the boat .
pap ,  and judge thatcher ,  and bessie thatcher ,  and jo harper ,  and tom sawyer ,  and his old aunt polly ,  and sid and mary ,  and plenty more .
everybody was talking about the murder ,  but the captain broke in and says :  look sharp ,  now ;  the current sets in the closest here ,  and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge .
i hope so ,  anyway i didn't hope so .
they all crowded up and leaned over the rails ,  nearly in my face ,  and kept still ,  watching with all their might .
i could see them firstrate ,  but they couldn't see me .
then the captain sung out :  stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke ,  and i judged i was gone .
if they'd a had some bullets in ,  i reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after .
well ,  i see i warn't hurt ,  thanks to goodness .
the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island .
i could hear the booming now and then ,  further and further off ,  and by and by ,  after an hour ,  i didn't hear it no more .
the island was three mile long .
i judged they had got to the foot ,  and was giving it up .
but they didn't yet a while .
they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side ,  under steam ,  and booming once in a while as they went .
i crossed over to that side and watched them .
when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town .
i knowed i was all right now .
nobody else would come ahunting after me .
i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods .
i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them .
i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw ,  and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper .
then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast .
when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking ,  and feeling pretty well satisfied ;  but by and by it got sort of lonesome ,  and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along ,  and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down ,  and then went to bed ;  there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ;  you can't stay so ,  you soon get over it .
and so for three days and nights .
no differencejust the same thing .
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island .
i was boss of it ;  it all belonged to me ,  so to say ,  and i wanted to know all about it ;  but mainly i wanted to put in the time .
i found plenty strawberries ,  ripe and prime ;  and green summer grapes ,  and green razberries ;  and the green blackberries was just beginning to show .
they would all come handy by and by ,  i judged .
well ,  i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warn't far from the foot of the island .
i had my gun along ,  but i hadn't shot nothing ;  it was for protection ;  thought i would kill some game nigh home .
about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake ,  and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers ,  and i after it ,  trying to get a shot at it .
i clipped along ,  and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking .
my heart jumped up amongst my lungs .
i never waited for to look further ,  but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could .
every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened ,  but my breath come so hard i couldn't hear nothing else .
i slunk along another piece further ,  then listened again ;  and so on ,  and so on .
if i see a stump ,  i took it for a man ;  if i trod on a stick and broke it ,  it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half ,  and the short half ,  too .
when i got to camp i warn't feeling very brash ,  there warn't much sand in my craw ;  but i says ,  this ain't no time to be fooling around .
so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight ,  and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year's camp ,  and then clumb a tree .
i reckon i was up in the tree two hours ;  but i didn't see nothing ,  i didn't hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things .
well ,  i couldn't stay up there forever ;  so at last i got down ,  but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time .
all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast .
by the time it was night i was pretty hungry .
so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile .
i went out in the woods and cooked a supper ,  and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk ,  plunketyplunk ,  and says to myself ,  horses coming ;  and next i hear people's voices .
i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could ,  and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out .
i hadn't got far when i hear a man say :  we better camp here if we can find a good place ;  the horses is about beat out .
let's look around i didn't wait ,  but shoved out and paddled away easy .
i tied up in the old place ,  and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe .
i didn't sleep much .
i couldn't ,  somehow ,  for thinking .
and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck .
so the sleep didn't do me no good .
by and by i says to myself ,  i can't live this way ;  i'm agoing to find out who it is that's here on the island with me ;  i'll find it out or bust .
well ,  i felt better right off .
so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two ,  and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows .
the moon was shining ,  and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day .
i poked along well on to an hour ,  everything still as rocks and sound asleep .
well ,  by this time i was most down to the foot of the island .
a little ripply ,  cool breeze begun to blow ,  and that was as good as saying the night was about done .
i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ;  then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods .
i sat down there on a log ,  and looked out through the leaves .
i see the moon go off watch ,  and the darkness begin to blanket the river .
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops ,  and knowed the day was coming .
so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire ,  stopping every minute or two to listen .
but i hadn't no luck somehow ;  i couldn't seem to find the place .
but by and by ,  sure enough ,  i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees .
i went for it ,  cautious and slow .
by and by i was close enough to have a look ,  and there laid a man on the ground .
it most give me the fantods .
he had a blanket around his head ,  and his head was nearly in the fire .
i set there behind a clump of bushes ,  in about six foot of him ,  and kept my eyes on him steady .
it was getting gray daylight now .
pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket ,  and it was miss watson's jim !
i bet i was glad to see him .
i says :  hello ,  jim and skipped out .
he bounced up and stared at me wild .
then he drops down on his knees ,  and puts his hands together and says :  doan' hurt medon't !
i hain't ever done no harm to a ghos' .
i alwuz liked dead people ,  en done all i could for 'em .
you go en git in de river agin ,  whah you b'longs ,  en doan' do nuffn to ole jim ,  'at 'uz awluz yo' fren' well ,  i warn't long making him understand i warn't dead .
i was ever so glad to see jim .
i warn't lonesome now .
i told him i warn't afraid of him telling the people where i was .
i talked along ,  but he only set there and looked at me ;  never said nothing .
then i says :  it's good daylight .
le's get breakfast .
make up your camp fire good what's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck ?
but you got a gun ,  hain't you ?
den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries strawberries and such truck ,  i says .
is that what you live on i couldn' git nuffn else ,  he says .
why ,  how long you been on the island ,  jim i come heah de night arter you's killed what ,  all that time yesindeedy and ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat no ,  sahnuffn else well ,  you must be most starved ,  ain't you i reck'n i could eat a hoss .
i think i could .
how long you ben on de islan' since the night i got killed no !
w'y ,  what has you lived on ?
but you got a gun .
oh ,  yes ,  you got a gun .
dat's good .
now you kill sumfn en i'll make up de fire so we went over to where the canoe was ,  and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees ,  i fetched meal and bacon and coffee ,  and coffeepot and fryingpan ,  and sugar and tin cups ,  and the nigger was set back considerable ,  because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft .
i catched a good big catfish ,  too ,  and jim cleaned him with his knife ,  and fried him .
when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot .
jim laid it in with all his might ,  for he was most about starved .
then when we had got pretty well stuffed ,  we laid off and lazied .
by and by jim says :  but looky here ,  huck ,  who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you then i told him the whole thing ,  and he said it was smart .
he said tom sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what i had .
then i says :  how do you come to be here ,  jim ,  and how'd you get here he looked pretty uneasy ,  and didn't say nothing for a minute .
then he says :  maybe i better not tell why ,  jim well ,  dey's reasons .
but you wouldn' tell on me ef i uz to tell you ,  would you ,  huck blamed if i would ,  jim well ,  i b'lieve you ,  huck .
ii run off jim but mind ,  you said you wouldn' tellyou know you said you wouldn' tell ,  huck well ,  i did .
i said i wouldn't ,  and i'll stick to it .
honest injun ,  i will .
people would call me a lowdown abolitionist and despise me for keeping mumbut that don't make no difference .
i ain't agoing to tell ,  and i ain't agoing back there ,  anyways .
so ,  now ,  le's know all about it well ,  you see ,  it 'uz dis way .
ole missusdat's miss watsonshe pecks on me all de time ,  en treats me pooty rough ,  but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to orleans .

i 'uz hungry ,  but i warn't afeard ;  bekase i knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de campmeet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day ,  en dey knows i goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight ,  so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place ,  en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin' .
de yuther servants wouldn' miss me ,  kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way .
well ,  when it come dark i tuck out up de river road ,  en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses .
i'd made up my mine 'bout what i's agwyne to do .
you see ,  ef i kep' on tryin' to git away afoot ,  de dogs 'ud track me ;  ef i stole a skift to cross over ,  dey'd miss dat skift ,  you see ,  en dey'd know 'bout whah i'd lan' on de yuther side ,  en whah to pick up my track .
so i says ,  a raff is what i's arter ;  it doan' make no track .
i see a light acomin' roun' de p'int bymeby ,  so i wade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river ,  en got in 'mongst de driftwood ,  en kep' my head down low ,  en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along .
den i swum to de stern uv it en tuck aholt .
it clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while .
so i clumb up en laid down on de planks .
de men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle ,  whah de lantern wuz .
de river wuz arisin' ,  en dey wuz a good current ;  so i reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' i'd be twentyfive mile down de river ,  en den i'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho' ,  en take to de woods on de illinois side .
but i didn' have no luck .
when we 'uz mos' down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern ,  i see it warn't no use fer to wait ,  so i slid overboard en struck out fer de islan' .
well ,  i had a notion i could lan' mos' anywhers ,  but i couldn'tbank too bluff .
i 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' i found' a good place .
i went into de woods en jedged i wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo' ,  long as dey move de lantern roun' so .
i had my pipe en a plug er dogleg ,  en some matches in my cap ,  en dey warn't wet ,  so i 'uz all right and so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time ?
why didn't you get mudturkles how you gwyne to git 'm ?
you can't slip up on um en grab um ;  en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock ?
how could a body do it in de night ?
en i warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime well ,  that's so .
you've had to keep in the woods all the time ,  of course .
did you hear 'em shooting the cannon oh ,  yes .
i knowed dey was arter you .
i see um go by heahwatched um thoo de bushes some young birds come along ,  flying a yard or two at a time and lighting .
jim said it was a sign it was going to rain .
he said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way ,  and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it .
i was going to catch some of them ,  but jim wouldn't let me .
he said it was death .
he said his father laid mighty sick once ,  and some of them catched a bird ,  and his old granny said his father would die ,  and he did .
and jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for dinner ,  because that would bring bad luck .
the same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown .
and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died ,  the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning ,  or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die .
jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots ;  but i didn't believe that ,  because i had tried them lots of times myself ,  and they wouldn't sting me .
i had heard about some of these things before ,  but not all of them .
jim knowed all kinds of signs .
he said he knowed most everything .
i said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck ,  and so i asked him if there warn't any goodluck signs .
he says :  mighty fewan' dey ain't no use to a body .
what you want to know when good luck's acomin' for ?
want to keep it off and he said :  ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas' ,  it's a sign dat you's agwyne to be rich .
well ,  dey's some use in a sign like dat ,  'kase it's so fur ahead .
you see ,  maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust ,  en so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast ,  jim what's de use to ax dat question ?
don't you see i has well ,  are you rich no ,  but i ben rich wunst ,  and gwyne to be rich agin .
wunst i had foteen dollars ,  but i tuck to specalat'n' ,  en got busted out what did you speculate in ,  jim well ,  fust i tackled stock what kind of stock why ,  live stockcattle ,  you know .
i put ten dollars in a cow .
but i ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock .
de cow up 'n' died on my han's so you lost the ten dollars no ,  i didn't lose it all .
i on'y los' 'bout nine of it .
i sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents you had five dollars and ten cents left .
did you speculate any more yes .
you know that onelaigged nigger dat b'longs to old misto bradish ?
well ,  he sot up a bank ,  en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year .
well ,  all de niggers went in ,  but dey didn't have much .
i wuz de on'y one dat had much .
so i stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars ,  en i said 'f i didn' git it i'd start a bank mysef .
well ,  o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business ,  bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks ,  so he say i could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirtyfive at de en' er de year .
so i done it .
den i reck'n'd i'd inves' de thirtyfive dollars right off en keep things amovin' .
dey wuz a nigger name' bob ,  dat had ketched a woodflat ,  en his marster didn' know it ;  en i bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirtyfive dollars when de en' er de year come ;  but somebody stole de woodflat dat night ,  en nex day de onelaigged nigger say de bank's busted .
so dey didn' none uv us git no money what did you do with the ten cents ,  jim well ,  i 'uz gwyne to spen' it ,  but i had a dream ,  en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name' balumbalum's ass dey call him for short ;  he's one er dem chuckleheads ,  you know .
but he's lucky ,  dey say ,  en i see i warn't lucky .
de dream say let balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me .
well ,  balum he tuck de money ,  en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de lord ,  en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times .
so balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po' ,  en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it well ,  what did come of it ,  jim nuffn never come of it .
i couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way ;  en balum he couldn' .
i ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout i see de security .
boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times ,  de preacher says !
ef i could git de ten cents back ,  i'd call it squah ,  en be glad er de chanst well ,  it's all right anyway ,  jim ,  long as you're going to be rich again some time or other yes ;  en i's rich now ,  come to look at it .
i owns mysef ,  en i's wuth eight hund'd dollars .
i wisht i had de money ,  i wouldn' want no mo' i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that i'd found when i was exploring ;  so we started and soon got to it ,  because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide .
this place was a tolerable long ,  steep hill or ridge about forty foot high .
we had a rough time getting to the top ,  the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick .
we tramped and clumb around all over it ,  and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock ,  most up to the top on the side towards illinois .
the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together ,  and jim could stand up straight in it .
it was cool in there .
jim was for putting our traps in there right away ,  but i said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time .
jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place ,  and had all the traps in the cavern ,  we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island ,  and they would never find us without dogs .
and ,  besides ,  he said them little birds had said it was going to rain ,  and did i want the things to get wet ?
so we went back and got the canoe ,  and paddled up abreast the cavern ,  and lugged all the traps up there .
then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in ,  amongst the thick willows .
we took some fish off of the lines and set them again ,  and begun to get ready for dinner .
the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in ,  and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit ,  and was flat and a good place to build a fire on .
so we built it there and cooked dinner .
we spread the blankets inside for a carpet ,  and eat our dinner in there .
we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern .
pretty soon it darkened up ,  and begun to thunder and lighten ;  so the birds was right about it .
directly it begun to rain ,  and it rained like all fury ,  too ,  and i never see the wind blow so .
it was one of these regular summer storms .
it would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside ,  and lovely ;  and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby ;  and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves ;  and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ;  and next ,  when it was just about the bluest and blackestfst !
it was as bright as glory ,  and you'd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the storm ,  hundreds of yards further than you could see before ;  dark as sin again in a second ,  and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash ,  and then go rumbling ,  grumbling ,  tumbling ,  down the sky towards the under side of the world ,  like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal ,  you know .
jim ,  this is nice ,  i says .
i wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here .
pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread well ,  you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for jim .
you'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner ,  en gittn' mos' drownded ,  too ;  dat you would ,  honey .
chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain ,  en so do de birds ,  chile the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days ,  till at last it was over the banks .
the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom .
on that side it was a good many miles wide ,  but on the missouri side it was the same old distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs .
daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe ,  it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods ,  even if the sun was blazing outside .
we went winding in and out amongst the trees ,  and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way .
well ,  on every old brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ;  and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame ,  on account of being hungry ,  that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ;  but not the snakes and turtlesthey would slide off in the water .
the ridge our cavern was in was full of them .
we could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them .
one night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks .
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long ,  and the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid ,  level floor .
we could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes ,  but we let them go ;  we didn't show ourselves in daylight .
another night when we was up at the head of the island ,  just before daylight ,  here comes a framehouse down ,  on the west side .
she was a twostory ,  and tilted over considerable .
we paddled out and got aboardclumb in at an upstairs window .
but it was too dark to see yet ,  so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight .
the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island .
then we looked in at the window .
we could make out a bed ,  and a table ,  and two old chairs ,  and lots of things around about on the floor ,  and there was clothes hanging against the wall .
there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man .
so jim says :  hello ,  you but it didn't budge .
so i hollered again ,  and then jim says :  de man ain't asleephe's dead .
you hold stilli'll go en see he went ,  and bent down and looked ,  and says :  it's a dead man .
yes ,  indeedy ;  naked ,  too .
he's ben shot in de back .
i reck'n he's ben dead two er three days .
come in ,  huck ,  but doan' look at his faceit's too gashly i didn't look at him at all .
jim throwed some old rags over him ,  but he needn't done it ;  i didn't want to see him .
there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor ,  and old whisky bottles ,  and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ;  and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal .
there was two old dirty calico dresses ,  and a sunbonnet ,  and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall ,  and some men's clothing ,  too .
we put the lot into the canoeit might come good .
there was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor ;  i took that ,  too .
and there was a bottle that had had milk in it ,  and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck .
we would a took the bottle ,  but it was broke .
there was a seedy old chest ,  and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke .
they stood open ,  but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account .
the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry ,  and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff .
we got an old tin lantern ,  and a butcherknife without any handle ,  and a brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store ,  and a lot of tallow candles ,  and a tin candlestick ,  and a gourd ,  and a tin cup ,  and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed ,  and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it ,  and a hatchet and some nails ,  and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it ,  and a roll of buckskin ,  and a leather dogcollar ,  and a horseshoe ,  and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them ;  and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomb ,  and jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow ,  and a wooden leg .
the straps was broke off of it ,  but ,  barring that ,  it was a good enough leg ,  though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim ,  and we couldn't find the other one ,  though we hunted all around .
and so ,  take it all around ,  we made a good haul .
when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island ,  and it was pretty broad day ;  so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt ,  because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off .
i paddled over to the illinois shore ,  and drifted down most a half a mile doing it .
i crept up the dead water under the bank ,  and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody .
we got home all safe .
after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed ,  but jim didn't want to .
he said it would fetch bad luck ;  and besides ,  he said ,  he might come and ha'nt us ;  he said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go aha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable .
that sounded pretty reasonable ,  so i didn't say no more ;  but i couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man ,  and what they done it for .
we rummaged the clothes we'd got ,  and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat .
jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat ,  because if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it .
i said i reckoned they killed him ,  too ;  but jim didn't want to talk about that .
i says :  now you think it's bad luck ;  but what did you say when i fetched in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ?
you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands .
well ,  here's your bad luck !
we've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides .
i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day ,  jim never you mind ,  honey ,  never you mind .
don't you git too peart .
it's acomin' .
mind i tell you ,  it's acomin' it did come ,  too .
it was a tuesday that we had that talk .
well ,  after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge ,  and got out of tobacco .
i went to the cavern to get some ,  and found a rattlesnake in there .
i killed him ,  and curled him up on the foot of jim's blanket ,  ever so natural ,  thinking there'd be some fun when jim found him there .
well ,  by night i forgot all about the snake ,  and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake's mate was there ,  and bit him .
he jumped up yelling ,  and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring .
i laid him out in a second with a stick ,  and jim grabbed pap's whiskyjug and begun to pour it down .
he was barefooted ,  and the snake bit him right on the heel .
that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it .
jim told me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away ,  and then skin the body and roast a piece of it .
i done it ,  and he eat it and said it would help cure him .
he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist ,  too .
he said that that would help .
then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ;  for i warn't going to let jim find out it was all my fault ,  not if i could help it .
jim sucked and sucked at the jug ,  and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ;  but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again .
his foot swelled up pretty big ,  and so did his leg ;  but by and by the drunk begun to come ,  and so i judged he was all right ;  but i'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky .
jim was laid up for four days and nights .
then the swelling was all gone and he was around again .
i made up my mind i wouldn't ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands ,  now that i see what had come of it .
jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time .
and he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet .
he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand .
well ,  i was getting to feel that way myself ,  though i've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do .
old hank bunker done it once ,  and bragged about it ;  and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower ,  and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer ,  as you may say ;  and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin ,  and buried him so ,  so they say ,  but i didn't see it .
pap told me .
but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way ,  like a fool .
well ,  the days went along ,  and the river went down between its banks again ;  and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man ,  being six foot two inches long ,  and weighed over two hundred pounds .
we couldn't handle him ,  of course ;  he would a flung us into illinois .
we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded .
we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball ,  and lots of rubbage .
we split the ball open with the hatchet ,  and there was a spool in it .
jim said he'd had it there a long time ,  to coat it over so and make a ball of it .
it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi ,  i reckon .
jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one .
he would a been worth a good deal over at the village .
they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there ;  everybody buys some of him ;  his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry .
next morning i said it was getting slow and dull ,  and i wanted to get a stirring up some way .
i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on .
jim liked that notion ;  but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp .
then he studied it over and said ,  couldn't i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl ?
that was a good notion ,  too .
so we shortened up one of the calico gowns ,  and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it .
jim hitched it behind with the hooks ,  and it was a fair fit .
i put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin ,  and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe .
jim said nobody would know me ,  even in the daytime ,  hardly .
i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things ,  and by and by i could do pretty well in them ,  only jim said i didn't walk like a girl ;  and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket .
i took notice ,  and done better .
i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark .
i started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding ,  and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town .
i tied up and started along the bank .
there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time ,  and i wondered who had took up quarters there .
i slipped up and peeped in at the window .
there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table .
i didn't know her face ;  she was a stranger ,  for you couldn't start a face in that town that i didn't know .
now this was lucky ,  because i was weakening ;  i was getting afraid i had come ;  people might know my voice and find me out .
but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know ;  so i knocked at the door ,  and made up my mind i wouldn't forget i was a girl .
come in ,  says the woman ,  and i did .
she says :  take a cheer i done it .
she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes ,  and says :  what might your name be sarah williams where 'bouts do you live ?
in this neighborhood' no'm .
in hookerville ,  seven mile below .
i've walked all the way and i'm all tired out hungry ,  too ,  i reckon .
i'll find you something no'm ,  i ain't hungry .
i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm ;  so i ain't hungry no more .
it's what makes me so late .
my mother's down sick ,  and out of money and everything ,  and i come to tell my uncle abner moore .
he lives at the upper end of the town ,  she says .
i hain't ever been here before .
do you know him no ;  but i don't know everybody yet .
i haven't lived here quite two weeks .
it's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town .
you better stay here all night .
take off your bonnet no ,  i says ;  i'll rest a while ,  i reckon ,  and go on .
i ain't afeared of the dark she said she wouldn't let me go by myself ,  but her husband would be in by and by ,  maybe in a hour and a half ,  and she'd send him along with me .
then she got to talking about her husband ,  and about her relations up the river ,  and her relations down the river ,  and about how much better off they used to was ,  and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town ,  instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on ,  till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ;  but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder ,  and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along .
she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was ,  and what a hard lot i was ,  and at last she got down to where i was murdered .
i says :  who done it ?
we've heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville ,  but we don't know who 'twas that killed huck finn well ,  i reckon there's a right smart chance of people here that'd like to know who killed him .
some think old finn done it himself nois that so most everybody thought it at first .
he'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched .
but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim why he i stopped .
i reckoned i better keep still .
she run on ,  and never noticed i had put in at all :  the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed .
so there's a reward out for himthree hundred dollars .
and there's a reward out for old finn ,  tootwo hundred dollars .
you see ,  he come to town the morning after the murder ,  and told about it ,  and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt ,  and right away after he up and left .
before night they wanted to lynch him ,  but he was gone ,  you see .
well ,  next day they found out the nigger was gone ;  they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done .
so then they put it on him ,  you see ;  and while they was full of it ,  next day ,  back comes old finn ,  and went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with .
the judge gave him some ,  and that evening he got drunk ,  and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hardlooking strangers ,  and then went off with them .
well ,  he hain't come back sence ,  and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little ,  for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it ,  and then he'd get huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit .
people do say he warn't any too good to do it .
oh ,  he's sly ,  i reckon .
if he don't come back for a year he'll be all right .
you can't prove anything on him ,  you know ;  everything will be quieted down then ,  and he'll walk in huck's money as easy as nothing yes ,  i reckon so ,  'm .
i don't see nothing in the way of it .
has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it oh ,  no ,  not everybody .
a good many thinks he done it .
but they'll get the nigger pretty soon now ,  and maybe they can scare it out of him why ,  are they after him yet well ,  you're innocent ,  ain't you !
does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ?
some folks think the nigger ain't far from here .
i'm one of thembut i hain't talked it around .
a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty ,  and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jackson's island .
don't anybody live there ?
says i .
no ,  nobody ,  says they .
i didn't say any more ,  but i done some thinking .
i was pretty near certain i'd seen smoke over there ,  about the head of the island ,  a day or two before that ,  so i says to myself ,  like as not that nigger's hiding over there ;  anyway ,  says i ,  it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt .
i hain't seen any smoke sence ,  so i reckon maybe he's gone ,  if it was him ;  but husband's going over to seehim and another man .
he was gone up the river ;  but he got back today ,  and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago i had got so uneasy i couldn't set still .
i had to do something with my hands ;  so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it .
my hands shook ,  and i was making a bad job of it .
when the woman stopped talking i looked up ,  and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little .
i put down the needle and thread ,  and let on to be interestedand i was ,  tooand says :  three hundred dollars is a power of money .
i wish my mother could get it .
is your husband going over there tonight oh ,  yes .
he went uptown with the man i was telling you of ,  to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun .
they'll go over after midnight couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime yes .
and couldn't the nigger see better ,  too ?
after midnight he'll likely be asleep ,  and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark ,  if he's got one i didn't think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious ,  and i didn't feel a bit comfortable .
pretty soon she says ,  what did you say your name was ,  honey mmary williams somehow it didn't seem to me that i said it was mary before ,  so i didn't look upseemed to me i said it was sarah ;  so i felt sort of cornered ,  and was afeared maybe i was looking it ,  too .
i wished the woman would say something more ;  the longer she set still the uneasier i was .
but now she says :  honey ,  i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in oh ,  yes'm ,  i did .
sarah mary williams .
sarah's my first name .
some calls me sarah ,  some calls me mary oh ,  that's the way of it yes'm i was feeling better then ,  but i wished i was out of there ,  anyway .
i couldn't look up yet .
well ,  the woman fell to talking about how hard times was ,  and how poor they had to live ,  and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place ,  and so forth and so on ,  and then i got easy again .
she was right about the rats .
you'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while .
she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone ,  or they wouldn't give her no peace .
she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot ,  and said she was a good shot with it generly ,  but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago ,  and didn't know whether she could throw true now .
but she watched for a chance ,  and directly banged away at a rat ;  but she missed him wide ,  and said ouch it hurt her arm so .
then she told me to try for the next one .
i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back ,  but of course i didn't let on .
i got the thing ,  and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive ,  and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat .
she said that was firstrate ,  and she reckoned i would hive the next one .
she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back ,  and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with .
i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them ,  and went on talking about her and her husband's matters .
but she broke off to say :  keep your eye on the rats .
you better have the lead in your lap ,  handy so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment ,  and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking .
but only about a minute .
then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face ,  and very pleasant ,  and says :  come ,  now ,  what's your real name whwhat ,  mum what's your real name ?
is it bill ,  or tom ,  or bobor what is it i reckon i shook like a leaf ,  and i didn't know hardly what to do .
but i says :  please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me ,  mum .
if i'm in the way here ,  i'll no ,  you won't .
set down and stay where you are .
i ain't going to hurt you ,  and i ain't going to tell on you ,  nuther .
you just tell me your secret ,  and trust me .
i'll keep it ;  and ,  what's more ,  i'll help you .
so'll my old man if you want him to .
you see ,  you're a runaway 'prentice ,  that's all .
it ain't anything .
there ain't no harm in it .
you've been treated bad ,  and you made up your mind to cut .
bless you ,  child ,  i wouldn't tell on you .
tell me all about it now ,  that's a good boy so i said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer ,  and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything ,  but she musn't go back on her promise .
then i told her my father and mother was dead ,  and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river ,  and he treated me so bad i couldn't stand it no longer ;  he went away to be gone a couple of days ,  and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out ,  and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles .
i traveled nights ,  and hid daytimes and slept ,  and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way ,  and i had aplenty .
i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me ,  and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen .
goshen ,  child ?
this ain't goshen .
this is st .
petersburg .
goshen's ten mile further up the river .
who told you this was goshen why ,  a man i met at daybreak this morning ,  just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep .
he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand ,  and five mile would fetch me to goshen he was drunk ,  i reckon .
he told you just exactly wrong well ,  he did act like he was drunk ,  but it ain't no matter now .
i got to be moving along .
i'll fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute .
i'll put you up a snack to eat .
you might want it so she put me up a snack ,  and says :  say ,  when a cow's laying down ,  which end of her gets up first ?
answer up prompt nowdon't stop to study over it .
which end gets up first the hind end ,  mum well ,  then ,  a horse the for'rard end ,  mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside ,  how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction the whole fifteen ,  mum well ,  i reckon you have lived in the country .
i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again .
what's your real name ,  now george peters ,  mum well ,  try to remember it ,  george .
don't forget and tell me it's elexander before you go ,  and then get out by saying it's george elexander when i catch you .
and don't go about women in that old calico .
you do a girl tolerable poor ,  but you might fool men ,  maybe .
bless you ,  child ,  when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ;  hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ;  that's the way a woman most always does ,  but a man always does t'other way .
and when you throw at a rat or anything ,  hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can ,  and miss your rat about six or seven foot .
throw stiffarmed from the shoulder ,  like there was a pivot there for it to turn on ,  like a girl ;  not from the wrist and elbow ,  with your arm out to one side ,  like a boy .
and ,  mind you ,  when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ;  she don't clap them together ,  the way you did when you catched the lump of lead .
why ,  i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ;  and i contrived the other things just to make certain .
now trot along to your uncle ,  sarah mary williams george elexander peters ,  and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs. judith loftus ,  which is me ,  and i'll do what i can to get you out of it .
keep the river road all the way ,  and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you .
the river road's a rocky one ,  and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to goshen ,  i reckon i went up the bank about fifty yards ,  and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was ,  a good piece below the house .
i jumped in ,  and was off in a hurry .
i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island ,  and then started across .
i took off the sunbonnet ,  for i didn't want no blinders on then .
when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike ,  so i stops and listens ;  the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven .
when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow ,  though i was most winded ,  but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be ,  and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot .
then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place ,  a mile and a half below ,  as hard as i could go .
i landed ,  and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern .
there jim laid ,  sound asleep on the ground .
i roused him out and says :  git up and hump yourself ,  jim !
there ain't a minute to lose .
they're after us jim never asked no questions ,  he never said a word ;  but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared .
by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft ,  and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid .
we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing ,  and didn't show a candle outside after that .
i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece ,  and took a look ;  but if there was a boat around i couldn't see it ,  for stars and shadows ain't good to see by .
then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade ,  past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word .
it must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last ,  and the raft did seem to go mighty slow .
if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore ;  and it was well a boat didn't come ,  for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe ,  or a fishingline ,  or anything to eat .
we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things .
it warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft .
if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built ,  and watched it all night for jim to come .
anyways ,  they stayed away from us ,  and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine .
i played it as low down on them as i could .
when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side ,  and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet ,  and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there .
a towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth .
we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side ,  and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place ,  so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us .
we laid there all day ,  and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore ,  and upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle .
i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman ;  and jim said she was a smart one ,  and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fireno ,  sir ,  she'd fetch a dog .
well ,  then ,  i said ,  why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog ?
jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start ,  and he believed they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time ,  or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno ,  indeedy ,  we would be in that same old town again .
so i said i didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't .
when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket ,  and looked up and down and across ;  nothing in sight ;  so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy ,  and to keep the things dry .
jim made a floor for the wigwam ,  and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft ,  so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves .
right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ;  this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly ;  the wigwam would keep it from being seen .
we made an extra steeringoar ,  too ,  because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something .
we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on ,  because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream ,  to keep from getting run over ;  but we wouldn't have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing ;  for the river was pretty high yet ,  very low banks being still a little under water ;  so upbound boats didn't always run the channel ,  but hunted easy water .
this second night we run between seven and eight hours ,  with a current that was making over four mile an hour .
we catched fish and talked ,  and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness .
it was kind of solemn ,  drifting down the big ,  still river ,  laying on our backs looking up at the stars ,  and we didn't ever feel like talking loud ,  and it warn't often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle .
we had mighty good weather as a general thing ,  and nothing ever happened to us at allthat night ,  nor the next ,  nor the next .
every night we passed towns ,  some of them away up on black hillsides ,  nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ;  not a house could you see .
the fifth night we passed st .
louis ,  and it was like the whole world lit up .
in st .
petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st .
louis ,  but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night .
there warn't a sound there ;  everybody was asleep .
every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village ,  and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ;  and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable ,  and took him along .
pap always said ,  take a chicken when you get a chance ,  because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does ,  and a good deed ain't ever forgot .
i never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself ,  but that is what he used to say ,  anyway .
mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon ,  or a mushmelon ,  or a punkin ,  or some new corn ,  or things of that kind .
pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ;  but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing ,  and no decent body would do it .
jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ;  so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others .
so we talked it over all one night ,  drifting along down the river ,  trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons ,  or the cantelopes ,  or the mushmelons ,  or what .
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory ,  and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons .
we warn't feeling just right before that ,  but it was all comfortable now .
i was glad the way it come out ,  too ,  because crabapples ain't ever good ,  and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet .
we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening .
take it all round ,  we lived pretty high .
the fifth night below st .
louis we had a big storm after midnight ,  with a power of thunder and lightning ,  and the rain poured down in a solid sheet .
we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself .
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead ,  and high ,  rocky bluffs on both sides .
by and by says i ,  hello ,  jim ,  looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock .
we was drifting straight down for her .
the lightning showed her very distinct .
she was leaning over ,  with part of her upper deck above water ,  and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear ,  and a chair by the big bell ,  with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it ,  when the flashes come .
well ,  it being away in the night and stormy ,  and all so mysteriouslike ,  i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river .
i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little ,  and see what there was there .
so i says :  le's land on her ,  jim but jim was dead against it at first .
he says :  i doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack .
we's doin' blame' well ,  en we better let blame' well alone ,  as de good book says .
like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmother ,  i says ;  there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse ;  and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this ,  when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldn't say nothing to that ,  so he didn't try .
and besides ,  i says ,  we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom .
seegars ,  i bet youand cost five cents apiece ,  solid cash .
steamboat captains is always rich ,  and get sixty dollars a month ,  and they don't care a cent what a thing costs ,  you know ,  long as they want it .
stick a candle in your pocket ;  i can't rest ,  jim ,  till we give her a rummaging .
do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing ?
not for pie ,  he wouldn't .
he'd call it an adventurethat's what he'd call it ;  and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act .
and wouldn't he throw style into itwouldn't he spread himself ,  nor nothing ?
why ,  you'd think it was christopher c'lumbus discovering kingdomcome .
i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbled a little ,  but give in .
he said we mustn't talk any more than we could help ,  and then talk mighty low .
the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time ,  and we fetched the stabboard derrick ,  and made fast there .
the deck was high out here .
we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard ,  in the dark ,  towards the texas ,  feeling our way slow with our feet ,  and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys ,  for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them .
pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight ,  and clumb on to it ;  and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door ,  which was open ,  and by jimminy ,  away down through the texashall we see a light !
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder !
jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick ,  and told me to come along .
i says ,  all right ,  and was going to start for the raft ;  but just then i heard a voice wail out and say :  oh ,  please don't ,  boys ;  i swear i won't ever tell another voice said ,  pretty loud :  it's a lie ,  jim turner .
you've acted this way before .
you always want more'n your share of the truck ,  and you've always got it ,  too ,  because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell .
but this time you've said it jest one time too many .
you're the meanest ,  treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim was gone for the raft .
i was just abiling with curiosity ;  and i says to myself ,  tom sawyer wouldn't back out now ,  and so i won't either ;  i'm agoing to see what's going on here .
so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage ,  and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the texas .
then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot ,  and two men standing over him ,  and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand ,  and the other one had a pistol .
this one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor ,  and saying :  i'd like to !
and i orter ,  tooa mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say ,  oh ,  please don't ,  bill ;  i hain't ever goin' to tell and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say :  'deed you ain't you never said no truer thing 'n that ,  you bet you and once he said :  hear him beg !
and yit if we hadn't got the best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both .
and what for ?
jist for noth'n .
jist because we stood on our rightsthat's what for .
but i lay you ain't agoin' to threaten nobody any more ,  jim turner .
put up that pistol ,  bill bill says :  i don't want to ,  jake packard .
i'm for killin' himand didn't he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand don't he deserve it but i don't want him killed ,  and i've got my reasons for it bless yo' heart for them words ,  jake packard !
i'll never forgit you long's i live says the man on the floor ,  sort of blubbering .
packard didn't take no notice of that ,  but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark ,  and motioned bill to come .
i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards ,  but the boat slanted so that i couldn't make very good time ;  so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side .
the man came apawing along in the dark ,  and when packard got to my stateroom ,  he says :  herecome in here and in he come ,  and bill after him .
but before they got in i was up in the upper berth ,  cornered ,  and sorry i come .
then they stood there ,  with their hands on the ledge of the berth ,  and talked .
i couldn't see them ,  but i could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having .
i was glad i didn't drink whisky ;  but it wouldn't made much difference anyway ,  because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because i didn't breathe .
i was too scared .
and ,  besides ,  a body couldn't breathe and hear such talk .
they talked low and earnest .
bill wanted to kill turner .
he says :  he's said he'll tell ,  and he will .
if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him .
shore's you're born ,  he'll turn state's evidence ;  now you hear me .
i'm for putting him out of his troubles so'm i ,  says packard ,  very quiet .
blame it ,  i'd sorter begun to think you wasn't .
well ,  then ,  that's all right .
le's go and do it hold on a minute ;  i hain't had my say yit .
you listen to me .
shooting's good ,  but there's quieter ways if the thing's got to be done .
but what i say is this :  it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks .
ain't that so you bet it is .
but how you goin' to manage it this time well ,  my idea is this :  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms ,  and shove for shore and hide the truck .
then we'll wait .
now i say it ain't agoin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river .
see ?
he'll be drownded ,  and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self .
i reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him .
i'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it ;  it ain't good sense ,  it ain't good morals .
ain't i right yes ,  i reck'n you are .
but s'pose she don't break up and wash off well ,  we can wait the two hours anyway and see ,  can't we all right ,  then ;  come along so they started ,  and i lit out ,  all in a cold sweat ,  and scrambled forward .
it was dark as pitch there ;  but i said ,  in a kind of a coarse whisper ,  jim and he answered up ,  right at my elbow ,  with a sort of a moan ,  and i says :  quick ,  jim ,  it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning ;  there's a gang of murderers in yonder ,  and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix .
but if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fixfor the sheriff 'll get 'em .
quickhurry !
i'll hunt the labboard side ,  you hunt the stabboard .
you start at the raft ,  and oh ,  my lordy ,  lordy !
raf' ?
dey ain' no raf' no mo' ;  she done broke loose en gone ien here we is well ,  i catched my breath and most fainted .
shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that !
but it warn't no time to be sentimentering .
we'd got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves .
so we went aquaking and shaking down the stabboard side ,  and slow work it was ,  tooseemed a week before we got to the stern .
no sign of a boat .
jim said he didn't believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadn't hardly any strength left ,  he said .
but i said ,  come on ,  if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix ,  sure .
so on we prowled again .
we struck for the stern of the texas ,  and found it ,  and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight ,  hanging on from shutter to shutter ,  for the edge of the skylight was in the water .
when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff ,  sure enough !
i could just barely see her .
i felt ever so thankful .
in another second i would a been aboard of her ,  but just then the door opened .
one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me ,  and i thought i was gone ;  but he jerked it in again ,  and says :  heave that blame lantern out o' sight ,  bill he flung a bag of something into the boat ,  and then got in himself and set down .
it was packard .
then bill he come out and got in .
packard says ,  in a low voice :  all readyshove off i couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters ,  i was so weak .
but bill says :  hold on'd you go through him no .
didn't you no .
so he's got his share o' the cash yet well ,  then ,  come along ;  no use to take truck and leave money say ,  won't he suspicion what we're up to maybe he won't .
but we got to have it anyway .
come along so they got out and went in .
the door slammed to because it was on the careened side ;  and in a half second i was in the boat ,  and jim come tumbling after me .
i out with my knife and cut the rope ,  and away we went !
we didn't touch an oar ,  and we didn't speak nor whisper ,  nor hardly even breathe .
we went gliding swift along ,  dead silent ,  past the tip of the paddlebox ,  and past the stern ;  then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck ,  and the darkness soaked her up ,  every last sign of her ,  and we was safe ,  and knowed it .
when we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second ,  and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat ,  and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was .
then jim manned the oars ,  and we took out after our raft .
now was the first time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadn't had time to before .
i begun to think how dreadful it was ,  even for murderers ,  to be in such a fix .
i says to myself ,  there ain't no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet ,  and then how would i like it ?
so says i to jim :  the first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it ,  in a place where it's a good hidingplace for you and the skiff ,  and then i'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn ,  and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape ,  so they can be hung when their time comes but that idea was a failure ;  for pretty soon it begun to storm again ,  and this time worse than ever .
the rain poured down ,  and never a light showed ;  everybody in bed ,  i reckon .
we boomed along down the river ,  watching for lights and watching for our raft .
after a long time the rain let up ,  but the clouds stayed ,  and the lightning kept whimpering ,  and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead ,  floating ,  and we made for it .
it was the raft ,  and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again .
we seen a light now away down to the right ,  on shore .
so i said i would go for it .
the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck .
we hustled it on to the raft in a pile ,  and i told jim to float along down ,  and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile ,  and keep it burning till i come ;  then i manned my oars and shoved for the light .
as i got down towards it three or four more showedup on a hillside .
it was a village .
i closed in above the shore light ,  and laid on my oars and floated .
as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat .
i skimmed around for the watchman ,  awondering whereabouts he slept ;  and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward ,  with his head down between his knees .
i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves ,  and begun to cry .
he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way ;  but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch ,  and then he says :  hello ,  what's up ?
don't cry ,  bub .
what's the trouble i says :  pap ,  and mam ,  and sis ,  and then i broke down .
he says :  oh ,  dang it now ,  don't take on so ;  we all has to have our troubles ,  and this 'n 'll come out all right .
what's the matter with 'em they'rethey'reare you the watchman of the boat yes ,  he says ,  kind of prettywellsatisfied like .
i'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand ;  and sometimes i'm the freight and passengers .
i ain't as rich as old jim hornback ,  and i can't be so blame' generous and good to tom ,  dick ,  and harry as what he is ,  and slam around money the way he does ;  but i've told him a many a time 't i wouldn't trade places with him ;  for ,  says i ,  a sailor's life's the life for me ,  and i'm derned if i'd live two mile out o' town ,  where there ain't nothing ever goin' on ,  not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it .
says i i broke in and says :  they're in an awful peck of trouble ,  and who is why ,  pap and mam and sis and miss hooker ;  and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there up where ?
where are they on the wreck what wreck why ,  there ain't but one what ,  you don't mean the walter scott yes good land !
what are they doin' there ,  for gracious sakes well ,  they didn't go there apurpose i bet they didn't !
why ,  great goodness ,  there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick !
why ,  how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easy enough .
miss hooker was avisiting up there to the town yes ,  booth's landinggo on she was avisiting there at booth's landing ,  and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay all night at her friend's house ,  miss whatyoumaycallher i disremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar ,  and swung around and went afloating down ,  stern first ,  about two mile ,  and saddlebaggsed on the wreck ,  and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost ,  but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck .
well ,  about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow ,  and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it ;  and so we saddlebaggsed ;  but all of us was saved but bill whippleand oh ,  he was the best creturi most wish 't it had been me ,  i do my george !
it's the beatenest thing i ever struck .
and then what did you all do well ,  we hollered and took on ,  but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear .
so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow .
i was the only one that could swim ,  so i made a dash for it ,  and miss hooker she said if i didn't strike help sooner ,  come here and hunt up her uncle ,  and he'd fix the thing .
i made the land about a mile below ,  and been fooling along ever since ,  trying to get people to do something ,  but they said ,  'what ,  in such a night and such a current ?
there ain't no sense in it ;  go for the steam ferry' now if you'll go and by jackson ,  i'd like to ,  and ,  blame it ,  i don't know but i will ;  but who in the dingnation's agoing' to pay for it ?
do you reckon your pap why that's all right .
miss hooker she tole me ,  particular ,  that her uncle hornback great guns !
is he her uncle ?
looky here ,  you break for that light over yonderway ,  and turn out west when you git there ,  and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern ;  tell 'em to dart you out to jim hornback's ,  and he'll foot the bill .
and don't you fool around any ,  because he'll want to know the news .
tell him i'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town .
hump yourself ,  now ;  i'm agoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i struck for the light ,  but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out ,  and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards ,  and tucked myself in among some woodboats ;  for i couldn't rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start .
but take it all around ,  i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang ,  for not many would a done it .
i wished the widow knowed about it .
i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions ,  because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in .
well ,  before long here comes the wreck ,  dim and dusky ,  sliding along down !
a kind of cold shiver went through me ,  and then i struck out for her .
she was very deep ,  and i see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her .
i pulled all around her and hollered a little ,  but there wasn't any answer ;  all dead still .
i felt a little bit heavyhearted about the gang ,  but not much ,  for i reckoned if they could stand it i could .
then here comes the ferryboat ;  so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant ;  and when i judged i was out of eyereach i laid on my oars ,  and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker's remainders ,  because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them ;  and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore ,  and i laid into my work and went abooming down the river .
it did seem a powerful long time before jim's light showed up ;  and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ;  so we struck for an island ,  and hid the raft ,  and sunk the skiff ,  and turned in and slept like dead people .
by and by ,  when we got up ,  we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck ,  and found boots ,  and blankets ,  and clothes ,  and all sorts of other things ,  and a lot of books ,  and a spyglass ,  and three boxes of seegars .
we hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives .
the seegars was prime .
we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking ,  and me reading the books ,  and having a general good time .
i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat ,  and i said these kinds of things was adventures ;  but he said he didn't want no more adventures .
he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died ,  because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed ;  for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded ;  and if he did get saved ,  whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward ,  and then miss watson would sell him south ,  sure .
well ,  he was right ;  he was most always right ;  he had an uncommon level head for a nigger .
i read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such ,  and how gaudy they dressed ,  and how much style they put on ,  and called each other your majesty ,  and your grace ,  and your lordship ,  and so on ,  'stead of mister ;  and jim's eyes bugged out ,  and he was interested .
he says :  i didn' know dey was so many un um .
i hain't hearn 'bout none un um ,  skasely ,  but ole king sollermun ,  onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards .
how much do a king git get i says ;  why ,  they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ;  they can have just as much as they want ;  everything belongs to them ain' dat gay ?
en what dey got to do ,  huck they don't do nothing !
why ,  how you talk !
they just set around no ;  is dat so of course it is .
they just set aroundexcept ,  maybe ,  when there's a war ;  then they go to the war .
but other times they just lazy around ;  or go hawkingjust hawking and spshd' you hear a noise we skipped out and looked ;  but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down ,  coming around the point ;  so we come back .
yes ,  says i ,  and other times ,  when things is dull ,  they fuss with the parlyment ;  and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off .
but mostly they hang round the harem roun' de which harem what's de harem the place where he keeps his wives .
don't you know about the harem ?
solomon had one ;  he had about a million wives why ,  yes ,  dat's so ;  ii'd done forgot it .
a harem's a bo'd'nhouse ,  i reck'n .
mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery .
en i reck'n de wives quarrels considable ;  en dat 'crease de racket .
yit dey say sollermun de wises' man dat ever live' .
i doan' take no stock in dat .
bekase why :  would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a blimblammin' all de time ?
no'deed he wouldn't .
a wise man 'ud take en buil' a bilerfactry ;  en den he could shet down de bilerfactry when he want to res' well ,  but he was the wisest man ,  anyway ;  because the widow she told me so ,  her own self i doan k'yer what de widder say ,  he warn't no wise man nuther .
he had some er de dadfetchedes' ways i ever see .
does you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two yes ,  the widow told me all about it well ,  den !
warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl' ?
you jes' take en look at it a minute .
dah's de stump ,  dahdat's one er de women ;  heah's youdat's de yuther one ;  i's sollermun ;  en dish yer dollar bill's de chile .
bofe un you claims it .
what does i do ?
does i shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill do b'long to ,  en han' it over to de right one ,  all safe en soun' ,  de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would ?
no ;  i take en whack de bill in two ,  en give half un it to you ,  en de yuther half to de yuther woman .
dat's de way sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile .
now i want to ast you :  what's de use er dat half a billcan't buy noth'n wid it .
en what use is a half a chile ?
i wouldn' give a dern for a million un um but hang it ,  jim ,  you've clean missed the pointblame it ,  you've missed it a thousand mile who ?
me ?
go 'long .
doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints .
i reck'n i knows sense when i sees it ;  en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as dat .
de 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile ,  de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile ;  en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain .
doan' talk to me 'bout sollermun ,  huck ,  i knows him by de back but i tell you you don't get the point blame de point !
i reck'n i knows what i knows .
en mine you ,  de real pint is down furderit's down deeper .
it lays in de way sollermun was raised .
you take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen ;  is dat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen ?
no ,  he ain't ;  he can't 'ford it .
he know how to value 'em .
but you take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de house ,  en it's diffunt .
he as soon chop a chile in two as a cat .
dey's plenty mo' .
a chile er two ,  mo' er less ,  warn't no consekens to sollermun ,  dad fatch him i never see such a nigger .
if he got a notion in his head once ,  there warn't no getting it out again .
he was the most down on solomon of any nigger i ever see .
so i went to talking about other kings ,  and let solomon slide .
i told about louis sixteenth that got his head cut off in france long time ago ;  and about his little boy the dolphin ,  that would a been a king ,  but they took and shut him up in jail ,  and some say he died there .
po' little chap but some says he got out and got away ,  and come to america dat's good !
but he'll be pooty lonesomedey ain' no kings here ,  is dey ,  huck no den he cain't git no situation .
what he gwyne to do well ,  i don't know .
some of them gets on the police ,  and some of them learns people how to talk french why ,  huck ,  doan' de french people talk de same way we does no ,  jim ;  you couldn't understand a word they saidnot a single word well ,  now ,  i be dingbusted !
how do dat come i don't know ;  but it's so .
i got some of their jabber out of a book .
s'pose a man was to come to you and say pollyvoofranzywhat would you think i wouldn' think nuff'n ;  i'd take en bust him over de headdat is ,  if he warn't white .
i wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat shucks ,  it ain't calling you anything .
it's only saying ,  do you know how to talk french well ,  den ,  why couldn't he say it why ,  he is asaying it .
that's a frenchman's way of saying it well ,  it's a blame ridicklous way ,  en i doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout it .
dey ain' no sense in it looky here ,  jim ;  does a cat talk like we do no ,  a cat don't well ,  does a cow no ,  a cow don't ,  nuther does a cat talk like a cow ,  or a cow talk like a cat no ,  dey don't it's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other ,  ain't it course and ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from us why ,  mos' sholy it is well ,  then ,  why ain't it natural and right for a frenchman to talk different from us ?
you answer me that is a cat a man ,  huck no well ,  den ,  dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man .
is a cow a maner is a cow a cat no ,  she ain't either of them well ,  den ,  she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of 'em .
is a frenchman a man yes well ,  den !
dad blame it ,  why doan' he talk like a man ?
you answer me dat i see it warn't no use wasting wordsyou can't learn a nigger to argue .
so i quit .
we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo ,  at the bottom of illinois ,  where the ohio river comes in ,  and that was what we was after .
we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states ,  and then be out of trouble .
well ,  the second night a fog begun to come on ,  and we made for a towhead to tie to ,  for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog ;  but when i paddled ahead in the canoe ,  with the line to make fast ,  there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to .
i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank ,  but there was a stiff current ,  and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went .
i see the fog closing down ,  and it made me so sick and scared i couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there warn't no raft in sight ;  you couldn't see twenty yards .
i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern ,  and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke .
but she didn't come .
i was in such a hurry i hadn't untied her .
i got up and tried to untie her ,  but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldn't hardly do anything with them .
as soon as i got started i took out after the raft ,  hot and heavy ,  right down the towhead .
that was all right as far as it went ,  but the towhead warn't sixty yards long ,  and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog ,  and hadn't no more idea which way i was going than a dead man .
thinks i ,  it won't do to paddle ;  first i know i'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ;  i got to set still and float ,  and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time .
i whooped and listened .
away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop ,  and up comes my spirits .
i went tearing after it ,  listening sharp to hear it again .
the next time it come i see i warn't heading for it ,  but heading away to the right of it .
and the next time i was heading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either ,  for i was flying around ,  this way and that and t'other ,  but it was going straight ahead all the time .
i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan ,  and beat it all the time ,  but he never did ,  and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me .
well ,  i fought along ,  and directly i hears the whoop behind me .
i was tangled good now .
that was somebody else's whoop ,  or else i was turned around .
i throwed the paddle down .
i heard the whoop again ;  it was behind me yet ,  but in a different place ;  it kept coming ,  and kept changing its place ,  and i kept answering ,  till by and by it was in front of me again ,  and i knowed the current had swung the canoe's head downstream ,  and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering .
i couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog ,  for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog .
the whooping went on ,  and in about a minute i come abooming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it ,  and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by ,  amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared ,  the currrent was tearing by them so swift .
in another second or two it was solid white and still again .
i set perfectly still then ,  listening to my heart thump ,  and i reckon i didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred .
i just give up then .
i knowed what the matter was .
that cut bank was an island ,  and jim had gone down t'other side of it .
it warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes .
it had the big timber of a regular island ;  it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
i kept quiet ,  with my ears cocked ,  about fifteen minutes ,  i reckon .
i was floating along ,  of course ,  four or five miles an hour ;  but you don't ever think of that .
no ,  you feel like you are laying dead still on the water ;  and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast you're going ,  but you catch your breath and think ,  my !
how that snag's tearing along .
if you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night ,  you try it onceyou'll see .
next ,  for about a half an hour ,  i whoops now and then ;  at last i hears the answer a long ways off ,  and tries to follow it ,  but i couldn't do it ,  and directly i judged i'd got into a nest of towheads ,  for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel between ,  and some that i couldn't see i knowed was there because i'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks .
well ,  i warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ;  and i only tried to chase them a little while ,  anyway ,  because it was worse than chasing a jacko'lantern .
you never knowed a sound dodge around so ,  and swap places so quick and so much .
i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times ,  to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ;  and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then ,  or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster than what i was .
well ,  i seemed to be in the open river again by and by ,  but i couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres .
i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag ,  maybe ,  and it was all up with him .
i was good and tired ,  so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldn't bother no more .
i didn't want to go to sleep ,  of course ;  but i was so sleepy i couldn't help it ;  so i thought i would take jest one little catnap .
but i reckon it was more than a catnap ,  for when i waked up the stars was shining bright ,  the fog was all gone ,  and i was spinning down a big bend stern first .
first i didn't know where i was ;  i thought i was dreaming ;  and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week .
it was a monstrous big river here ,  with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ;  just a solid wall ,  as well as i could see by the stars .
i looked away downstream ,  and seen a black speck on the water .
i took after it ;  but when i got to it it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together .
then i see another speck ,  and chased that ;  then another ,  and this time i was right .
it was the raft .
when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees ,  asleep ,  with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar .
the other oar was smashed off ,  and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt .
so she'd had a rough time .
i made fast and laid down under jim's nose on the raft ,  and began to gap ,  and stretch my fists out against jim ,  and says :  hello ,  jim ,  have i been asleep ?
why didn't you stir me up goodness gracious ,  is dat you ,  huck ?
en you ain' deadyou ain' drowndedyou's back agin ?
it's too good for true ,  honey ,  it's too good for true .
lemme look at you chile ,  lemme feel o' you .
no ,  you ain' dead !
you's back agin ,  'live en soun' ,  jis de same ole huckde same ole huck ,  thanks to goodness what's the matter with you ,  jim ?
you been adrinking drinkin' ?
has i ben adrinkin' ?
has i had a chance to be adrinkin' well ,  then ,  what makes you talk so wild how does i talk wild how ?
why ,  hain't you been talking about my coming back ,  and all that stuff ,  as if i'd been gone away huckhuck finn ,  you look me in de eye ;  look me in de eye .
hain't you ben gone away gone away ?
why ,  what in the nation do you mean ?
i hain't been gone anywheres .
where would i go to well ,  looky here ,  boss ,  dey's sumf'n wrong ,  dey is .
is i me ,  or who is i ?
is i heah ,  or whah is i ?
now dat's what i wants to know well ,  i think you're here ,  plain enough ,  but i think you're a tangleheaded old fool ,  jim i is ,  is i ?
well ,  you answer me dis :  didn't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de towhead no ,  i didn't .
what towhead ?
i hain't see no towhead you hain't seen no towhead ?
looky here ,  didn't de line pull loose en de raf' go ahummin' down de river ,  en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why ,  de fogde fog dat's been aroun' all night .
en didn't you whoop ,  en didn't i whoop ,  tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los' ,  'kase he didn' know whah he wuz ?
en didn't i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded ?
now ain' dat so ,  bossain't it so ?
you answer me dat well ,  this is too many for me ,  jim .
i hain't seen no fog ,  nor no islands ,  nor no troubles ,  nor nothing .
i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago ,  and i reckon i done the same .
you couldn't a got drunk in that time ,  so of course you've been dreaming dad fetch it ,  how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes well ,  hang it all ,  you did dream it ,  because there didn't any of it happen but ,  huck ,  it's all jis' as plain to me as it don't make no difference how plain it is ;  there ain't nothing in it .
i know ,  because i've been here all the time jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes ,  but set there studying over it .
then he says :  well ,  den ,  i reck'n i did dream it ,  huck ;  but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream i ever see .
en i hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one oh ,  well ,  that's all right ,  because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes .
but this one was a staving dream ;  tell me all about it ,  jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through ,  just as it happened ,  only he painted it up considerable .
then he said he must start in and 'terpret it ,  because it was sent for a warning .
he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good ,  but the current was another man that would get us away from him .
the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then ,  and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck ,  'stead of keeping us out of it .
the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks ,  but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate them ,  we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river ,  which was the free states ,  and wouldn't have no more trouble .
it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft ,  but it was clearing up again now .
oh ,  well ,  that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes ,  jim ,  i says ;  but what does these things stand for it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar .
you could see them firstrate now .
jim looked at the trash ,  and then looked at me ,  and back at the trash again .
he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away .
but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling ,  and says :  what do dey stan' for ?
i'se gwyne to tell you .
when i got all wore out wid work ,  en wid de callin' for you ,  en went to sleep ,  my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los' ,  en i didn' k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf' .
en when i wake up en fine you back agin ,  all safe en soun' ,  de tears come ,  en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot ,  i's so thankful .
en all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie .
dat truck dah is trash ;  en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam ,  and went in there without saying anything but that .
but that was enough .
it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back .
it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ;  but i done it ,  and i warn't ever sorry for it afterwards ,  neither .
i didn't do him no more mean tricks ,  and i wouldn't done that one if i'd a knowed it would make him feel that way .
we slept most all day ,  and started out at night ,  a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession .
she had four long sweeps at each end ,  so we judged she carried as many as thirty men ,  likely .
she had five big wigwams aboard ,  wide apart ,  and an open camp fire in the middle ,  and a tall flagpole at each end .
there was a power of style about her .
it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that .
we went drifting down into a big bend ,  and the night clouded up and got hot .
the river was very wide ,  and was walled with solid timber on both sides ;  you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever ,  or a light .
we talked about cairo ,  and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it .
i said likely we wouldn't ,  because i had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there ,  and if they didn't happen to have them lit up ,  how was we going to know we was passing a town ?
jim said if the two big rivers joined together there ,  that would show .
but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again .
that disturbed jimand me too .
so the question was ,  what to do ?
i said ,  paddle ashore the first time a light showed ,  and tell them pap was behind ,  coming along with a tradingscow ,  and was a green hand at the business ,  and wanted to know how far it was to cairo .
jim thought it was a good idea ,  so we took a smoke on it and waited .
there warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town ,  and not pass it without seeing it .
he said he'd be mighty sure to see it ,  because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it ,  but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom .
every little while he jumps up and says :  dah she is but it warn't .
it was jacko'lanterns ,  or lightning bugs ;  so he set down again ,  and went to watching ,  same as before .
jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom .
well ,  i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish ,  too ,  to hear him ,  because i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it ?
why ,  me .
i couldn't get that out of my conscience ,  no how nor no way .
it got to troubling me so i couldn't rest ;  i couldn't stay still in one place .
it hadn't ever come home to me before ,  what this thing was that i was doing .
but now it did ;  and it stayed with me ,  and scorched me more and more .
i tried to make out to myself that i warn't to blame ,  because i didn't run jim off from his rightful owner ;  but it warn't no use ,  conscience up and says ,  every time ,  but you knowed he was running for his freedom ,  and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody that was soi couldn't get around that noway .
that was where it pinched .
conscience says to me ,  what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ?
what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ?
why ,  she tried to learn you your book ,  she tried to learn you your manners ,  she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how .
that's what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead .
i fidgeted up and down the raft ,  abusing myself to myself ,  and jim was fidgeting up and down past me .
we neither of us could keep still .
every time he danced around and says ,  dah's cairo it went through me like a shot ,  and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness .
jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself .
he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent ,  and when he got enough he would buy his wife ,  which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived ;  and then they would both work to buy the two children ,  and if their master wouldn't sell them ,  they'd get an ab'litionist to go and steal them .
it most froze me to hear such talk .
he wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before .
just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free .
it was according to the old saying ,  give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell thinks i ,  this is what comes of my not thinking .
here was this nigger ,  which i had as good as helped to run away ,  coming right out flatfooted and saying he would steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didn't even know ;  a man that hadn't ever done me no harm .
i was sorry to hear jim say that ,  it was such a lowering of him .
my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever ,  until at last i says to it ,  let up on meit ain't too late yeti'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off .
all my troubles was gone .
i went to looking out sharp for a light ,  and sort of singing to myself .
by and by one showed .
jim sings out :  we's safe ,  huck ,  we's safe !
jump up and crack yo' heels !
dat's de good ole cairo at las' ,  i jis knows it i says :  i'll take the canoe and go and see ,  jim .
it mightn't be ,  you know he jumped and got the canoe ready ,  and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on ,  and give me the paddle ;  and as i shoved off ,  he says :  pooty soon i'll be ashout'n' for joy ,  en i'll say ,  it's all on accounts o' huck ;  i's a free man ,  en i couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for huck ;  huck done it .
jim won't ever forgit you ,  huck ;  you's de bes' fren' jim's ever had ;  en you's de only fren' ole jim's got now i was paddling off ,  all in a sweat to tell on him ;  but when he says this ,  it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me .
i went along slow then ,  and i warn't right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warn't .
when i was fifty yards off ,  jim says :  dah you goes ,  de ole true huck ;  de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole jim well ,  i just felt sick .
but i says ,  i got to do iti can't get out of it .
right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns ,  and they stopped and i stopped .
one of them says :  what's that yonder a piece of a raft ,  i says .
do you belong on it yes ,  sir any men on it only one ,  sir well ,  there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder ,  above the head of the bend .
is your man white or black i didn't answer up prompt .
i tried to ,  but the words wouldn't come .
i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it ,  but i warn't man enoughhadn't the spunk of a rabbit .
i see i was weakening ;  so i just give up trying ,  and up and says :  he's white i reckon we'll go and see for ourselves i wish you would ,  says i ,  because it's pap that's there ,  and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is .
he's sickand so is mam and mary ann oh ,  the devil !
we're in a hurry ,  boy .
but i s'pose we've got to .
come ,  buckle to your paddle ,  and let's get along i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars .
when we had made a stroke or two ,  i says :  pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you ,  i can tell you .
everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore ,  and i can't do it by myself well ,  that's infernal mean .
odd ,  too .
say ,  boy ,  what's the matter with your father it's theathewell ,  it ain't anything much they stopped pulling .
it warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now .
one says :  boy ,  that's a lie .
what is the matter with your pap ?
answer up square now ,  and it'll be the better for you i will ,  sir ,  i will ,  honestbut don't leave us ,  please .
it's thethegentlemen ,  if you'll only pull ahead ,  and let me heave you the headline ,  you won't have to come anear the raftplease do set her back ,  john ,  set her back says one .
they backed water .
keep away ,  boykeep to looard .
confound it ,  i just expect the wind has blowed it to us .
your pap's got the smallpox ,  and you know it precious well .
why didn't you come out and say so ?
do you want to spread it all over well ,  says i ,  ablubbering ,  i've told everybody before ,  and they just went away and left us poor devil ,  there's something in that .
we are right down sorry for you ,  but wewell ,  hang it ,  we don't want the smallpox ,  you see .
look here ,  i'll tell you what to do .
don't you try to land by yourself ,  or you'll smash everything to pieces .
you float along down about twenty miles ,  and you'll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river .
it will be long after sunup then ,  and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever .
don't be a fool again ,  and let people guess what is the matter .
now we're trying to do you a kindness ;  so you just put twenty miles between us ,  that's a good boy .
it wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light isit's only a woodyard .
say ,  i reckon your father's poor ,  and i'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck .
here ,  i'll put a twentydollar gold piece on this board ,  and you get it when it floats by .
i feel mighty mean to leave you ;  but my kingdom !
it won't do to fool with smallpox ,  don't you see hold on ,  parker ,  says the other man ,  here's a twenty to put on the board for me .
goodbye ,  boy ;  you do as mr. parker told you ,  and you'll be all right that's so ,  my boygoodbye ,  goodbye .
if you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them ,  and you can make some money by it goodbye ,  sir ,  says i ;  i won't let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it they went off and i got aboard the raft ,  feeling bad and low ,  because i knowed very well i had done wrong ,  and i see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right ;  a body that don't get started right when he's little ain't got no showwhen the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work ,  and so he gets beat .
then i thought a minute ,  and says to myself ,  hold on ;  s'pose you'd a done right and give jim up ,  would you felt better than what you do now ?
no ,  says i ,  i'd feel badi'd feel just the same way i do now .
well ,  then ,  says i ,  what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong ,  and the wages is just the same ?
i was stuck .
i couldn't answer that .
so i reckoned i wouldn't bother no more about it ,  but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time .
i went into the wigwam ;  jim warn't there .
i looked all around ;  he warn't anywhere .
i says :  jim here i is ,  huck .
is dey out o' sight yit ?
don't talk loud he was in the river under the stern oar ,  with just his nose out .
i told him they were out of sight ,  so he come aboard .
he says :  i was alistenin' to all de talk ,  en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard .
den i was gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone .
but lawsy ,  how you did fool 'em ,  huck !
dat wuz de smartes' dodge !
i tell you ,  chile ,  i'spec it save' ole jimole jim ain't going to forgit you for dat ,  honey then we talked about the money .
it was a pretty good raisetwenty dollars apiece .
jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now ,  and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states .
he said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go ,  but he wished we was already there .
towards daybreak we tied up ,  and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good .
then he worked all day fixing things in bundles ,  and getting all ready to quit rafting .
that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a lefthand bend .
i went off in the canoe to ask about it .
pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff ,  setting a trotline .
i ranged up and says :  mister ,  is that town cairo cairo ?
no .
you must be a blame' fool what town is it ,  mister if you want to know ,  go and find out .
if you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't want i paddled to the raft .
jim was awful disappointed ,  but i said never mind ,  cairo would be the next place ,  i reckoned .
we passed another town before daylight ,  and i was going out again ;  but it was high ground ,  so i didn't go .
no high ground about cairo ,  jim said .
i had forgot it .
we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the lefthand bank .
i begun to suspicion something .
so did jim .
i says :  maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night he says :  doan' le's talk about it ,  huck .
po' niggers can't have no luck .
i awluz 'spected dat rattlesnakeskin warn't done wid its work i wish i'd never seen that snakeskin ,  jimi do wish i'd never laid eyes on it it ain't yo' fault ,  huck ;  you didn' know .
don't you blame yo'self 'bout it when it was daylight ,  here was the clear ohio water inshore ,  sure enough ,  and outside was the old regular muddy !
so it was all up with cairo .
we talked it all over .
it wouldn't do to take to the shore ;  we couldn't take the raft up the stream ,  of course .
there warn't no way but to wait for dark ,  and start back in the canoe and take the chances .
so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket ,  so as to be fresh for the work ,  and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone !
we didn't say a word for a good while .
there warn't anything to say .
we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin ;  so what was the use to talk about it ?
it would only look like we was finding fault ,  and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetching it ,  too ,  till we knowed enough to keep still .
by and by we talked about what we better do ,  and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
we warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around ,  the way pap would do ,  for that might set people after us .
so we shoved out after dark on the raft .
anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snakeskin ,  after all that that snakeskin done for us ,  will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us .
the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore .
but we didn't see no rafts laying up ;  so we went along during three hours and more .
well ,  the night got gray and ruther thick ,  which is the next meanest thing to fog .
you can't tell the shape of the river ,  and you can't see no distance .
it got to be very late and still ,  and then along comes a steamboat up the river .
we lit the lantern ,  and judged she would see it .
upstream boats didn't generly come close to us ;  they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ;  but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
we could hear her pounding along ,  but we didn't see her good till she was close .
she aimed right for us .
often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ;  sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep ,  and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs ,  and thinks he's mighty smart .
well ,  here she comes ,  and we said she was going to try and shave us ;  but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit .
she was a big one ,  and she was coming in a hurry ,  too ,  looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it ;  but all of a sudden she bulged out ,  big and scary ,  with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth ,  and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us .
there was a yell at us ,  and a jingling of bells to stop the engines ,  a powwow of cussing ,  and whistling of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other ,  she come smashing straight through the raft .
i divedand i aimed to find the bottom ,  too ,  for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me ,  and i wanted it to have plenty of room .
i could always stay under water a minute ;  this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half .
then i bounced for the top in a hurry ,  for i was nearly busting .
i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose ,  and puffed a bit .
of course there was a booming current ;  and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them ,  for they never cared much for raftsmen ;  so now she was churning along up the river ,  out of sight in the thick weather ,  though i could hear her .
i sung out for jim about a dozen times ,  but i didn't get any answer ;  so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water ,  and struck out for shore ,  shoving it ahead of me .
but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore ,  which meant that i was in a crossing ;  so i changed off and went that way .
it was one of these long ,  slanting ,  twomile crossings ;  so i was a good long time in getting over .
i made a safe landing ,  and clumb up the bank .
i couldn't see but a little ways ,  but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more ,  and then i run across a big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it .
i was going to rush by and get away ,  but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me ,  and i knowed better than to move another peg .
in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out ,  and says :  be done ,  boys !
who's there i says :  it's me who's me george jackson ,  sir what do you want i don't want nothing ,  sir .
i only want to go along by ,  but the dogs won't let me what are you prowling around here this time of night forhey i warn't prowling around ,  sir ,  i fell overboard off of the steamboat oh ,  you did ,  did you ?
strike a light there ,  somebody .
what did you say your name was george jackson ,  sir .
i'm only a boy look here ,  if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraidnobody'll hurt you .
but don't try to budge ;  stand right where you are .
rouse out bob and tom ,  some of you ,  and fetch the guns .
george jackson ,  is there anybody with you no ,  sir ,  nobody i heard the people stirring around in the house now ,  and see a light .
the man sung out :  snatch that light away ,  betsy ,  you old foolain't you got any sense ?
put it on the floor behind the front door .
bob ,  if you and tom are ready ,  take your places all ready now ,  george jackson ,  do you know the shepherdsons no ,  sir ;  i never heard of them well ,  that may be so ,  and it mayn't .
now ,  all ready .
step forward ,  george jackson .
and mind ,  don't you hurrycome mighty slow .
if there's anybody with you ,  let him keep backif he shows himself he'll be shot .
come along now .
come slow ;  push the door open yourselfjust enough to squeeze in ,  d' you hear i didn't hurry ;  i couldn't if i'd a wanted to .
i took one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound ,  only i thought i could hear my heart .
the dogs were as still as the humans ,  but they followed a little behind me .
when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting .
i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said ,  there ,  that's enoughput your head in i done it ,  but i judged they would take it off .
the candle was on the floor ,  and there they all was ,  looking at me ,  and me at them ,  for about a quarter of a minute :  three big men with guns pointed at me ,  which made me wince ,  i tell you ;  the oldest ,  gray and about sixty ,  the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady ,  and back of her two young women which i couldn't see right well .
the old gentleman says :  there ;  i reckon it's all right .
come in as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it ,  and told the young men to come in with their guns ,  and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor ,  and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windowsthere warn't none on the side .
they held the candle ,  and took a good look at me ,  and all said ,  why ,  he ain't a shepherdsonno ,  there ain't any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldn't mind being searched for arms ,  because he didn't mean no harm by itit was only to make sure .
so he didn't pry into my pockets ,  but only felt outside with his hands ,  and said it was all right .
he told me to make myself easy and at home ,  and tell all about myself ;  but the old lady says :  why ,  bless you ,  saul ,  the poor thing's as wet as he can be ;  and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry true for you ,  racheli forgot so the old lady says :  betsy this was a nigger woman ,  you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can ,  poor thing ;  and one of you girls go and wake up buck and tell himoh ,  here he is himself .
buck ,  take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there ,  though he was a little bigger than me .
he hadn't on anything but a shirt ,  and he was very frowzyheaded .
he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes ,  and he was dragging a gun along with the other one .
he says :  ain't they no shepherdsons around they said ,  no ,  'twas a false alarm .
well ,  he says ,  if they'd a ben some ,  i reckon i'd a got one they all laughed ,  and bob says :  why ,  buck ,  they might have scalped us all ,  you've been so slow in coming well ,  nobody come after me ,  and it ain't right i'm always kept down ;  i don't get no show never mind ,  buck ,  my boy ,  says the old man ,  you'll have show enough ,  all in good time ,  don't you fret about that .
go 'long with you now ,  and do as your mother told you when we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his ,  and i put them on .
while i was at it he asked me what my name was ,  but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday ,  and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out .
i said i didn't know ;  i hadn't heard about it before ,  no way .
well ,  guess ,  he says .
how'm i going to guess ,  says i ,  when i never heard tell of it before but you can guess ,  can't you ?
it's just as easy which candle i says .
why ,  any candle ,  he says .
i don't know where he was ,  says i ;  where was he why ,  he was in the dark !
that's where he was well ,  if you knowed where he was ,  what did you ask me for why ,  blame it ,  it's a riddle ,  don't you see ?
say ,  how long are you going to stay here ?
you got to stay always .
we can just have booming timesthey don't have no school now .
do you own a dog ?
i've got a dogand he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in .
do you like to comb up sundays ,  and all that kind of foolishness ?
you bet i don't ,  but ma she makes me .
confound these ole britches !
i reckon i'd better put 'em on ,  but i'd ruther not ,  it's so warm .
are you all ready ?
all right .
come along ,  old hoss cold cornpone ,  cold cornbeef ,  butter and buttermilkthat is what they had for me down there ,  and there ain't nothing better that ever i've come across yet .
buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes ,  except the nigger woman ,  which was gone ,  and the two young women .
they all smoked and talked ,  and i eat and talked .
the young women had quilts around them ,  and their hair down their backs .
they all asked me questions ,  and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw ,  and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more ,  and bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more ,  and tom and mort died ,  and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left ,  and he was just trimmed down to nothing ,  on account of his troubles ;  so when he died i took what there was left ,  because the farm didn't belong to us ,  and started up the river ,  deck passage ,  and fell overboard ;  and that was how i come to be here .
so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it .
then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed ,  and i went to bed with buck ,  and when i waked up in the morning ,  drat it all ,  i had forgot what my name was .
so i laid there about an hour trying to think ,  and when buck waked up i says :  can you spell ,  buck yes ,  he says .
i bet you can't spell my name ,  says i .
i bet you what you dare i can ,  says he .
all right ,  says i ,  go ahead george jaxonthere now ,  he says .
well ,  says i ,  you done it ,  but i didn't think you could .
it ain't no slouch of a name to spellright off without studying i set it down ,  private ,  because somebody might want me to spell it next ,  and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it .
it was a mighty nice family ,  and a mighty nice house ,  too .
i hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style .
it didn't have an iron latch on the front door ,  nor a wooden one with a buckskin string ,  but a brass knob to turn ,  the same as houses in town .
there warn't no bed in the parlor ,  nor a sign of a bed ;  but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them .
there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom ,  and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ;  sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrown ,  same as they do in town .
they had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog .
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece ,  with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front ,  and a round place in the middle of it for the sun ,  and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it .
it was beautiful to hear that clock tick ;  and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape ,  she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out .
they wouldn't took any money for her .
well ,  there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock ,  made out of something like chalk ,  and painted up gaudy .
by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery ,  and a crockery dog by the other ;  and when you pressed down on them they squeaked ,  but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested .
they squeaked through underneath .
there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things .
on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it ,  which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is ,  but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk ,  or whatever it was ,  underneath .
this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth ,  with a red and blue spreadeagle painted on it ,  and a painted border all around .
it come all the way from philadelphia ,  they said .
there was some books ,  too ,  piled up perfectly exact ,  on each corner of the table .
one was a big family bible full of pictures .
one was pilgrim's progress ,  about a man that left his family ,  it didn't say why .
i read considerable in it now and then .
the statements was interesting ,  but tough .
another was friendship's offering ,  full of beautiful stuff and poetry ;  but i didn't read the poetry .
another was henry clay's speeches ,  and another was dr .
gunn's family medicine ,  which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead .
there was a hymn book ,  and a lot of other books .
and there was nice splitbottom chairs ,  and perfectly sound ,  toonot bagged down in the middle and busted ,  like an old basket .
they had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettes ,  and battles ,  and highland marys ,  and one called signing the declaration there was some that they called crayons ,  which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old .
they was different from any pictures i ever see beforeblacker ,  mostly ,  than is common .
one was a woman in a slim black dress ,  belted small under the armpits ,  with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves ,  and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil ,  and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape ,  and very wee black slippers ,  like a chisel ,  and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow ,  under a weeping willow ,  and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule ,  and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head ,  and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback ,  and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up ,  and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon ,  and tears running down her cheeks ;  and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it ,  and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth ,  and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures ,  i reckon ,  but i didn't somehow seem to take to them ,  because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fantods .
everybody was sorry she died ,  because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do ,  and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost .
but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard .
she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick ,  and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done ,  but she never got the chance .
it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown ,  standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off ,  with her hair all down her back ,  and looking up to the moon ,  with the tears running down her face ,  and she had two arms folded across her breast ,  and two arms stretched out in front ,  and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best ,  and then scratch out all the other arms ;  but ,  as i was saying ,  she died before she got her mind made up ,  and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room ,  and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it .
other times it was hid with a little curtain .
the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face ,  but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery ,  seemed to me .
this young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive ,  and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer ,  and write poetry after them out of her own head .
it was very good poetry .
this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded :  ode to stephen dowling bots ,  dec'd and did young stephen sicken ,   and did young stephen die ?
and did the sad hearts thicken ,   and did the mourners cry ?
no ;  such was not the fate of  young stephen dowling bots ;  though sad hearts round him thickened ,   'twas not from sickness' shots .
no whoopingcough did rack his frame ,   nor measles drear with spots ;  not these impaired the sacred name  of stephen dowling bots .
despised love struck not with woe  that head of curly knots ,  nor stomach troubles laid him low ,   young stephen dowling bots .
o no .
then list with tearful eye ,   whilst i his fate do tell .
his soul did from this cold world fly  by falling down a well .
they got him out and emptied him ;   alas it was too late ;  his spirit was gone for to sport aloft  in the realms of the good and great .
if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen ,  there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by .
buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing .
she didn't ever have to stop to think .
he said she would slap down a line ,  and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one ,  and go ahead .
she warn't particular ;  she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful .
every time a man died ,  or a woman died ,  or a child died ,  she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold .
she called them tributes .
the neighbors said it was the doctor first ,  then emmeline ,  then the undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once ,  and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name ,  which was whistler .
she warn't ever the same after that ;  she never complained ,  but she kinder pined away and did not live long .
poor thing ,  many's the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little .
i liked all that family ,  dead ones and all ,  and warn't going to let anything come between us .
poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive ,  and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ;  so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself ,  but i couldn't seem to make it go somehow .
they kept emmeline's room trim and nice ,  and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive ,  and nobody ever slept there .
the old lady took care of the room herself ,  though there was plenty of niggers ,  and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly .
well ,  as i was saying about the parlor ,  there was beautiful curtains on the windows :  white ,  with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls ,  and cattle coming down to drink .
there was a little old piano ,  too ,  that had tin pans in it ,  i reckon ,  and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it .
the walls of all the rooms was plastered ,  and most had carpets on the floors ,  and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside .
it was a double house ,  and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored ,  and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day ,  and it was a cool ,  comfortable place .
nothing couldn't be better .
and warn't the cooking good ,  and just bushels of it too !
col .
grangerford was a gentleman ,  you see .
he was a gentleman all over ;  and so was his family .
he was well born ,  as the saying is ,  and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse ,  so the widow douglas said ,  and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ;  and pap he always said it ,  too ,  though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself .
col .
grangerford was very tall and very slim ,  and had a darkishpaly complexion ,  not a sign of red in it anywheres ;  he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face ,  and he had the thinnest kind of lips ,  and the thinnest kind of nostrils ,  and a high nose ,  and heavy eyebrows ,  and the blackest kind of eyes ,  sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you ,  as you may say .
his forehead was high ,  and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders .
his hands was long and thin ,  and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ;  and on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it .
he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it .
there warn't no frivolishness about him ,  not a bit ,  and he warn't ever loud .
he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that ,  you know ,  and so you had confidence .
sometimes he smiled ,  and it was good to see ;  but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole ,  and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows ,  you wanted to climb a tree first ,  and find out what the matter was afterwards .
he didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmannered where he was .
everybody loved to have him around ,  too ;  he was sunshine most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather .
when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute ,  and that was enough ;  there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week .
when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday ,  and didn't set down again till they had set down .
then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was ,  and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him ,  and he held it in his hand and waited till tom's and bob's was mixed ,  and then they bowed and said ,  our duty to you ,  sir ,  and madam ;  and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you ,  and so they drank ,  all three ,  and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers ,  and give it to me and buck ,  and we drank to the old people too .
bob was the oldest and tom nexttall ,  beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces ,  and long black hair and black eyes .
they dressed in white linen from head to foot ,  like the old gentleman ,  and wore broad panama hats .
then there was miss charlotte ;  she was twentyfive ,  and tall and proud and grand ,  but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up ;  but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks ,  like her father .
she was beautiful .
so was her sister ,  miss sophia ,  but it was a different kind .
she was gentle and sweet like a dove ,  and she was only twenty .
each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too .
my nigger had a monstrous easy time ,  because i warn't used to having anybody do anything for me ,  but buck's was on the jump most of the time .
this was all there was of the family now ,  but there used to be morethree sons ;  they got killed ;  and emmeline that died .
the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers .
sometimes a stack of people would come there ,  horseback ,  from ten or fifteen mile around ,  and stay five or six days ,  and have such junketings round about and on the river ,  and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes ,  and balls at the house nights .
these people was mostly kinfolks of the family .
the men brought their guns with them .
it was a handsome lot of quality ,  i tell you .
there was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six familiesmostly of the name of shepherdson .
they was as hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords .
the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing ,  which was about two mile above our house ;  so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses .
one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting ,  and heard a horse coming .
we was crossing the road .
buck says :  quick !
jump for the woods we done it ,  and then peeped down the woods through the leaves .
pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road ,  setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier .
he had his gun across his pommel .
i had seen him before .
it was young harney shepherdson .
i heard buck's gun go off at my ear ,  and harney's hat tumbled off from his head .
he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid .
but we didn't wait .
we started through the woods on a run .
the woods warn't thick ,  so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet ,  and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun ;  and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat ,  i reckon ,  but i couldn't see .
we never stopped running till we got home .
the old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute'twas pleasure ,  mainly ,  i judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down ,  and he says ,  kind of gentle :  i don't like that shooting from behind a bush .
why didn't you step into the road ,  my boy the shepherdsons don't ,  father .
they always take advantage miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale ,  and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped .
the two young men looked dark ,  but never said nothing .
miss sophia she turned pale ,  but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt .
soon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves ,  i says :  did you want to kill him ,  buck well ,  i bet i did what did he do to you him ?
he never done nothing to me well ,  then ,  what did you want to kill him for why ,  nothingonly it's on account of the feud what's a feud why ,  where was you raised ?
don't you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetell me about it well ,  says buck ,  a feud is this way :  a man has a quarrel with another man ,  and kills him ;  then that other man's brother kills him ;  then the other brothers ,  on both sides ,  goes for one another ;  then the cousins chip inand by and by everybody's killed off ,  and there ain't no more feud .
but it's kind of slow ,  and takes a long time has this one been going on long ,  buck well ,  i should reckon !
it started thirty year ago ,  or som'ers along there .
there was trouble 'bout something ,  and then a lawsuit to settle it ;  and the suit went agin one of the men ,  and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do ,  of course .
anybody would what was the trouble about ,  buckland i reckon maybei don't know well ,  who done the shooting ?
was it a grangerford or a shepherdson laws ,  how do i know ?
it was so long ago don't anybody know oh ,  yes ,  pa knows ,  i reckon ,  and some of the other old people ;  but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place has there been many killed ,  buck yes ;  right smart chance of funerals .
but they don't always kill .
pa's got a few buckshot in him ;  but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much ,  anyway .
bob's been carved up some with a bowie ,  and tom's been hurt once or twice has anybody been killed this year ,  buck yes ;  we got one and they got one .
'bout three months ago my cousin bud ,  fourteen year old ,  was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river ,  and didn't have no weapon with him ,  which was blame' foolishness ,  and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him ,  and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair aflying in the wind ;  and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush ,  bud 'lowed he could outrun him ;  so they had it ,  nip and tuck ,  for five mile or more ,  the old man againing all the time ;  so at last bud seen it warn't any use ,  so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front ,  you know ,  and the old man he rode up and shot him down .
but he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck ,  for inside of a week our folks laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward ,  buck i reckon he warn't a coward .
not by a blame' sight .
there ain't a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one .
and there ain't no cowards amongst the grangerfords either .
why ,  that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords ,  and come out winner .
they was all ahorseback ;  he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile ,  and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets ;  but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man ,  and peppered away at him ,  and he peppered away at them .
him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled ,  but the grangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of 'em was dead ,  and another died the next day .
no ,  sir ;  if a body's out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons ,  becuz they don't breed any of that kind next sunday we all went to church ,  about three mile ,  everybody ahorseback .
the men took their guns along ,  so did buck ,  and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall .
the shepherdsons done the same .
it was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love ,  and suchlike tiresomeness ;  but everybody said it was a good sermon ,  and they all talked it over going home ,  and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination ,  and i don't know what all ,  that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet .
about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around ,  some in their chairs and some in their rooms ,  and it got to be pretty dull .
buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep .
i went up to our room ,  and judged i would take a nap myself .
i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door ,  which was next to ours ,  and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft ,  and asked me if i liked her ,  and i said i did ;  and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody ,  and i said i would .
then she said she'd forgot her testament ,  and left it in the seat at church between two other books ,  and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her ,  and not say nothing to nobody .
i said i would .
so i slid out and slipped off up the road ,  and there warn't anybody at the church ,  except maybe a hog or two ,  for there warn't any lock on the door ,  and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because it's cool .
if you notice ,  most folks don't go to church only when they've got to ;  but a hog is different .
says i to myself ,  something's up ;  it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament .
so i give it a shake ,  and out drops a little piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil .
i ransacked it ,  but couldn't find anything else .
i couldn't make anything out of that ,  so i put the paper in the book again ,  and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me .
she pulled me in and shut the door ;  then she looked in the testament till she found the paper ,  and as soon as she read it she looked glad ;  and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze ,  and said i was the best boy in the world ,  and not to tell anybody .
she was mighty red in the face for a minute ,  and her eyes lighted up ,  and it made her powerful pretty .
i was a good deal astonished ,  but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about ,  and she asked me if i had read it ,  and i said no ,  and she asked me if i could read writing ,  and i told her no ,  only coarsehand ,  and then she said the paper warn't anything but a bookmark to keep her place ,  and i might go and play now .
i went off down to the river ,  studying over this thing ,  and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind .
when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second ,  and then comes arunning ,  and says :  mars jawge ,  if you'll come down into de swamp i'll show you a whole stack o' watermoccasins thinks i ,  that's mighty curious ;  he said that yesterday .
he oughter know a body don't love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them .
what is he up to ,  anyway ?
so i says :  all right ;  trot ahead i followed a half a mile ;  then he struck out over the swamp ,  and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile .
we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines ,  and he says :  you shove right in dah jist a few steps ,  mars jawge ;  dah's whah dey is .
i's seed 'm befo' ;  i don't k'yer to see 'em no mo' then he slopped right along and went away ,  and pretty soon the trees hid him .
i poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines ,  and found a man laying there asleepand ,  by jings ,  it was my old jim !
i waked him up ,  and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again ,  but it warn't .
he nearly cried he was so glad ,  but he warn't surprised .
said he swum along behind me that night ,  and heard me yell every time ,  but dasn't answer ,  because he didn't want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again .
says he :  i got hurt a little ,  en couldn't swim fas' ,  so i wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las' ;  when you landed i reck'ned i could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you ,  but when i see dat house i begin to go slow .
i 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to youi wuz 'fraid o' de dogs ;  but when it 'uz all quiet agin i knowed you's in de house ,  so i struck out for de woods to wait for day .
early in de mawnin' some er de niggers come along ,  gwyne to de fields ,  en dey tuk me en showed me dis place ,  whah de dogs can't track me on accounts o' de water ,  en dey brings me truck to eat every night ,  en tells me how you's agitt'n along why didn't you tell my jack to fetch me here sooner ,  jim well ,  'twarn't no use to 'sturb you ,  huck ,  tell we could do sumfnbut we's all right now .
i ben abuyin' pots en pans en vittles ,  as i got a chanst ,  en apatchin' up de raf' nights when what raft ,  jim our ole raf' you mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders no ,  she warn't .
she was tore up a good dealone en' of her was ;  but dey warn't no great harm done ,  on'y our traps was mos' all los' .
ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water ,  en de night hadn' ben so dark ,  en we warn't so sk'yerd ,  en ben sich punkinheads ,  as de sayin' is ,  we'd a seed de raf' .
but it's jis' as well we didn't ,  'kase now she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new ,  en we's got a new lot o' stuff ,  in de place o' what 'uz los' why ,  how did you get hold of the raft again ,  jimdid you catch her how i gwyne to ketch her en i out in de woods ?
no ;  some er de niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben' ,  en dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows ,  en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat i come to heah 'bout it pooty soon ,  so i ups en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um ,  but to you en me ;  en i ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty ,  en git a hid'n for it ?
den i gin 'm ten cents apiece ,  en dey 'uz mighty well satisfied ,  en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make 'm rich agin .
dey's mighty good to me ,  dese niggers is ,  en whatever i wants 'm to do fur me i doan' have to ast 'm twice ,  honey .
dat jack's a good nigger ,  en pooty smart yes ,  he is .
he ain't ever told me you was here ;  told me to come ,  and he'd show me a lot of watermoccasins .
if anything happens he ain't mixed up in it .
he can say he never seen us together ,  and it 'll be the truth i don't want to talk much about the next day .
i reckon i'll cut it pretty short .
i waked up about dawn ,  and was agoing to turn over and go to sleep again when i noticed how still it wasdidn't seem to be anybody stirring .
that warn't usual .
next i noticed that buck was up and gone .
well ,  i gets up ,  awondering ,  and goes down stairsnobody around ;  everything as still as a mouse .
just the same outside .
thinks i ,  what does it mean ?
down by the woodpile i comes across my jack ,  and says :  what's it all about says he :  don't you know ,  mars jawge no ,  says i ,  i don't well ,  den ,  miss sophia's run off !
'deed she has .
she run off in de night some timenobody don't know jis' when ;  run off to get married to dat young harney shepherdson ,  you knowleastways ,  so dey 'spec .
de fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour agomaybe a little mo'en' i tell you dey warn't no time los' .
sich another hurryin' up guns en hosses you never see !
de women folks has gone for to stir up de relations ,  en ole mars saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin git acrost de river wid miss sophia .
i reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty rough times buck went off 'thout waking me up well ,  i reck'n he did !
dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it .
mars buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a shepherdson or bust .
well ,  dey'll be plenty un 'm dah ,  i reck'n ,  en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst i took up the river road as hard as i could put .
by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off .
when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place ,  and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach ,  and watched .
there was a woodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree ,  and first i was going to hide behind that ;  but maybe it was luckier i didn't .
there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store ,  cussing and yelling ,  and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the steamboat landing ;  but they couldn't come it .
every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at .
the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile ,  so they could watch both ways .
by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling .
they started riding towards the store ;  then up gets one of the boys ,  draws a steady bead over the woodrank ,  and drops one of them out of his saddle .
all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ;  and that minute the two boys started on the run .
they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed .
then the men see them ,  and jumped on their horses and took out after them .
they gained on the boys ,  but it didn't do no good ,  the boys had too good a start ;  they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree ,  and slipped in behind it ,  and so they had the bulge on the men again .
one of the boys was buck ,  and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old .
the men ripped around awhile ,  and then rode away .
as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him .
he didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first .
he was awful surprised .
he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ;  said they was up to some devilment or otherwouldn't be gone long .
i wished i was out of that tree ,  but i dasn't come down .
buck begun to cry and rip ,  and 'lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet .
he said his father and his two brothers was killed ,  and two or three of the enemy .
said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush .
buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them .
i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia .
he said they'd got across the river and was safe .
i was glad of that ;  but the way buck did take on because he didn't manage to kill harney that day he shot at himi hain't ever heard anything like it .
all of a sudden ,  bang !
bang !
bang !
goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses !
the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out ,  kill them ,  kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree .
i ain't agoing to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that .
i wished i hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things .
i ain't ever going to get shut of themlots of times i dream about them .
i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark ,  afraid to come down .
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods ;  and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ;  so i reckoned the trouble was still agoing on .
i was mighty downhearted ;  so i made up my mind i wouldn't ever go anear that house again ,  because i reckoned i was to blame ,  somehow .
i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off ;  and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted ,  and then maybe he would a locked her up ,  and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened .
when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece ,  and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water ,  and tugged at them till i got them ashore ;  then i covered up their faces ,  and got away as quick as i could .
i cried a little when i was covering up buck's face ,  for he was mighty good to me .
it was just dark now .
i never went near the house ,  but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
jim warn't on his island ,  so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick ,  and crowded through the willows ,  redhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country .
the raft was gone !
my souls ,  but i was scared !
i couldn't get my breath for most a minute .
then i raised a yell .
a voice not twentyfive foot from me says :  good lan' !
is dat you ,  honey ?
doan' make no noise it was jim's voicenothing ever sounded so good before .
i run along the bank a piece and got aboard ,  and jim he grabbed me and hugged me ,  he was so glad to see me .
he says :  laws bless you ,  chile ,  i 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin .
jack's been heah ;  he say he reck'n you's ben shot ,  kase you didn' come home no mo' ;  so i's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de crick ,  so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead .
lawsy ,  i's mighty glad to git you back again ,  honey i says :  all rightthat's mighty good ;  they won't find me ,  and they'll think i've been killed ,  and floated down the riverthere's something up there that 'll help them think soso don't you lose no time ,  jim ,  but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi .
then we hung up our signal lantern ,  and judged that we was free and safe once more .
i hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday ,  so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk ,  and pork and cabbage and greensthere ain't nothing in the world so good when it's cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time .
i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds ,  and so was jim to get away from the swamp .
we said there warn't no home like a raft ,  after all .
other places do seem so cramped up and smothery ,  but a raft don't .
you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft .
two or three days and nights went by ;  i reckon i might say they swum by ,  they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely .
here is the way we put in the time .
it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile and a half wide ;  we run nights ,  and laid up and hid daytimes ;  soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in the dead water under a towhead ;  and then cut young cottonwoods and willows ,  and hid the raft with them .
then we set out the lines .
next we slid into the river and had a swim ,  so as to freshen up and cool off ;  then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep ,  and watched the daylight come .
not a sound anywheresperfectly stilljust like the whole world was asleep ,  only sometimes the bullfrogs acluttering ,  maybe .
the first thing to see ,  looking away over the water ,  was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on t'other side ;  you couldn't make nothing else out ;  then a pale place in the sky ;  then more paleness spreading around ;  then the river softened up away off ,  and warn't black any more ,  but gray ;  you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows ,  and such things ;  and long black streaksrafts ;  sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking ;  or jumbled up voices ,  it was so still ,  and sounds come so far ;  and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ;  and you see the mist curl up off of the water ,  and the east reddens up ,  and the river ,  and you make out a logcabin in the edge of the woods ,  away on the bank on t'other side of the river ,  being a woodyard ,  likely ,  and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ;  then the nice breeze springs up ,  and comes fanning you from over there ,  so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ;  but sometimes not that way ,  because they've left dead fish laying around ,  gars and such ,  and they do get pretty rank ;  and next you've got the full day ,  and everything smiling in the sun ,  and the songbirds just going it !
a little smoke couldn't be noticed now ,  so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast .
and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river ,  and kind of lazy along ,  and by and by lazy off to sleep .
wake up by and by ,  and look to see what done it ,  and maybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream ,  so far off towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or sidewheel ;  then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness .
next you'd see a raft sliding by ,  away off yonder ,  and maybe a galoot on it chopping ,  because they're most always doing it on a raft ;  you'd see the axe flash and come downyou don't hear nothing ;  you see that axe go up again ,  and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the k'chunkit had took all that time to come over the water .
so we would put in the day ,  lazying around ,  listening to the stillness .
once there was a thick fog ,  and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them .
a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain ;  but we couldn't see no sign of them ;  it made you feel crawly ;  it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air .
jim said he believed it was spirits ;  but i says :  no ;  spirits wouldn't say ,  'dern the dern fog' soon as it was night out we shoved ;  when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone ,  and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ;  then we lit the pipes ,  and dangled our legs in the water ,  and talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked ,  day and night ,  whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes buck's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable ,  and besides i didn't go much on clothes ,  nohow .
sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time .
yonder was the banks and the islands ,  across the water ;  and maybe a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window ;  and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow ,  you know ;  and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts .
it's lovely to live on a raft .
we had the sky up there ,  all speckled with stars ,  and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them ,  and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened .
jim he allowed they was made ,  but i allowed they happened ;  i judged it would have took too long to make so many .
jim said the moon could a laid them ;  well ,  that looked kind of reasonable ,  so i didn't say nothing against it ,  because i've seen a frog lay most as many ,  so of course it could be done .
we used to watch the stars that fell ,  too ,  and see them streak down .
jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest .
once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark ,  and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys ,  and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ;  then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ;  and by and by her waves would get to us ,  a long time after she was gone ,  and joggle the raft a bit ,  and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long ,  except maybe frogs or something .
after midnight the people on shore went to bed ,  and then for two or three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows .
these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming ,  so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away .
one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods ,  to see if i couldn't get some berries .
just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick ,  here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it .
i thought i was a goner ,  for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim .
i was about to dig out from there in a hurry ,  but they was pretty close to me then ,  and sung out and begged me to save their livessaid they hadn't been doing nothing ,  and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming .
they wanted to jump right in ,  but i says :  don't you do it .
i don't hear the dogs and horses yet ;  you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ;  then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthat'll throw the dogs off the scent they done it ,  and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead ,  and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off ,  shouting .
we heard them come along towards the crick ,  but couldn't see them ;  they seemed to stop and fool around a while ;  then ,  as we got further and further away all the time ,  we couldn't hardly hear them at all ;  by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river ,  everything was quiet ,  and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe .
one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards ,  and had a bald head and very gray whiskers .
he had an old batteredup slouch hat on ,  and a greasy blue woollen shirt ,  and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops ,  and homeknit gallusesno ,  he only had one .
he had an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm ,  and both of them had big ,  fat ,  rattylooking carpetbags .
the other fellow was about thirty ,  and dressed about as ornery .
after breakfast we all laid off and talked ,  and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another .
what got you into trouble says the baldhead to t'other chap .
well ,  i'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand it does take it off ,  too ,  and generly the enamel along with itbut i stayed about one night longer than i ought to ,  and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town ,  and you told me they were coming ,  and begged me to help you to get off .
so i told you i was expecting trouble myself ,  and would scatter out with you .
that's the whole yarnwhat's yourn ?
well ,  i'd ben arunning' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week ,  and was the pet of the women folks ,  big and little ,  for i was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies ,  i tell you ,  and takin' as much as five or six dollars a nightten cents a head ,  children and niggers freeand business agrowin' all the time ,  when somehow or another a little report got around last night that i had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the sly .
a nigger rousted me out this mornin' ,  and told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses ,  and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start ,  and then run me down if they could ;  and if they got me they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail ,  sure .
i didn't wait for no breakfasti warn't hungry old man ,  said the young one ,  i reckon we might doubleteam it together ;  what do you think i ain't undisposed .
what's your linemainly jour printer by trade ;  do a little in patent medicines ;  theateractortragedy ,  you know ;  take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there's a chance ;  teach singinggeography school for a change ;  sling a lecture sometimesoh ,  i do lots of thingsmost anything that comes handy ,  so it ain't work .
what's your lay i've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time .
layin' on o' hands is my best holtfor cancer and paralysis ,  and sich things ;  and i k'n tell a fortune pretty good when i've got somebody along to find out the facts for me .
preachin's my line ,  too ,  and workin' campmeetin's ,  and missionaryin' around nobody never said anything for a while ;  then the young man hove a sigh and says :  alas what 're you alassin' about says the baldhead .
to think i should have lived to be leading such a life ,  and be degraded down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
dern your skin ,  ain't the company good enough for you says the baldhead ,  pretty pert and uppish .
yes ,  it is good enough for me ;  it's as good as i deserve ;  for who fetched me so low when i was so high ?
i did myself .
i don't blame you ,  gentlemenfar from it ;  i don't blame anybody .
i deserve it all .
let the cold world do its worst ;  one thing i knowthere's a grave somewhere for me .
the world may go on just as it's always done ,  and take everything from meloved ones ,  property ,  everything ;  but it can't take that .
some day i'll lie down in it and forget it all ,  and my poor broken heart will be at rest he went on awiping .
drot your pore broken heart ,  says the baldhead ;  what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f'r ?
we hain't done nothing no ,  i know you haven't .
i ain't blaming you ,  gentlemen .
i brought myself downyes ,  i did it myself .
it's right i should sufferperfectly righti don't make any moan brought you down from whar ?
whar was you brought down from ah ,  you would not believe me ;  the world never believeslet it pass'tis no matter .
the secret of my birth the secret of your birth !
do you mean to say gentlemen ,  says the young man ,  very solemn ,  i will reveal it to you ,  for i feel i may have confidence in you .
by rights i am a duke jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that ;  and i reckon mine did ,  too .
then the baldhead says :  no !
you can't mean it yes .
my greatgrandfather ,  eldest son of the duke of bridgewater ,  fled to this country about the end of the last century ,  to breathe the pure air of freedom ;  married here ,  and died ,  leaving a son ,  his own father dying about the same time .
the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored .
i am the lineal descendant of that infanti am the rightful duke of bridgewater ;  and here am i ,  forlorn ,  torn from my high estate ,  hunted of men ,  despised by the cold world ,  ragged ,  worn ,  heartbroken ,  and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft jim pitied him ever so much ,  and so did i .
we tried to comfort him ,  but he said it warn't much use ,  he couldn't be much comforted ;  said if we was a mind to acknowledge him ,  that would do him more good than most anything else ;  so we said we would ,  if he would tell us how .
he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him ,  and say your grace ,  or my lord ,  or your lordshipand he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain bridgewater ,  which ,  he said ,  was a title anyway ,  and not a name ;  and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner ,  and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
well ,  that was all easy ,  so we done it .
all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him ,  and says ,  will yo' grace have some o' dis or some o' dat and so on ,  and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him .
but the old man got pretty silent by and bydidn't have much to say ,  and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke .
he seemed to have something on his mind .
so ,  along in the afternoon ,  he says :  looky here ,  bilgewater ,  he says ,  i'm nation sorry for you ,  but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that no no you ain't .
you ain't the only person that's ben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place alas no ,  you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth and ,  by jings ,  he begins to cry .
hold !
what do you mean bilgewater ,  kin i trust you says the old man ,  still sort of sobbing .
to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it ,  and says ,  that secret of your being :  speak bilgewater ,  i am the late dauphin you bet you ,  jim and me stared this time .
then the duke says :  you are what yes ,  my friend ,  it is too trueyour eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin ,  looy the seventeen ,  son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette you !
at your age !
no !
you mean you're the late charlemagne ;  you must be six or seven hundred years old ,  at the very least trouble has done it ,  bilgewater ,  trouble has done it ;  trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude .
yes ,  gentlemen ,  you see before you ,  in blue jeans and misery ,  the wanderin' ,  exiled ,  trampledon ,  and sufferin' rightful king of france well ,  he cried and took on so that me and jim didn't know hardly what to do ,  we was so sorryand so glad and proud we'd got him with us ,  too .
so we set in ,  like we done before with the duke ,  and tried to comfort him .
but he said it warn't no use ,  nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ;  though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights ,  and got down on one knee to speak to him ,  and always called him your majesty ,  and waited on him first at meals ,  and didn't set down in his presence till he asked them .
so jim and me set to majestying him ,  and doing this and that and t'other for him ,  and standing up till he told us we might set down .
this done him heaps of good ,  and so he got cheerful and comfortable .
but the duke kind of soured on him ,  and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ;  still ,  the king acted real friendly towards him ,  and said the duke's greatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father ,  and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ;  but the duke stayed huffy a good while ,  till by and by the king says :  like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft ,  bilgewater ,  and so what's the use o' your bein' sour ?
it 'll only make things oncomfortable .
it ain't my fault i warn't born a duke ,  it ain't your fault you warn't born a kingso what's the use to worry ?
make the best o' things the way you find 'em ,  says ithat's my motto .
this ain't no bad thing that we've struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome ,  give us your hand ,  duke ,  and le's all be friends the duke done it ,  and jim and me was pretty glad to see it .
it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it ,  because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ;  for what you want ,  above all things ,  on a raft ,  is for everybody to be satisfied ,  and feel right and kind towards the others .
it didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all ,  but just lowdown humbugs and frauds .
but i never said nothing ,  never let on ;  kept it to myself ;  it's the best way ;  then you don't have no quarrels ,  and don't get into no trouble .
if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes ,  i hadn't no objections ,  'long as it would keep peace in the family ;  and it warn't no use to tell jim ,  so i didn't tell him .
if i never learnt nothing else out of pap ,  i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
they asked us considerable many questions ;  wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for ,  and laid by in the daytime instead of runningwas jim a runaway nigger ?
says i :  goodness sakes !
would a runaway nigger run south no ,  they allowed he wouldn't .
i had to account for things some way ,  so i says :  my folks was living in pike county ,  in missouri ,  where i was born ,  and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike .
pa ,  he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with uncle ben ,  who's got a little onehorse place on the river ,  fortyfour mile below orleans .
pa was pretty poor ,  and had some debts ;  so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger ,  jim .
that warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile ,  deck passage nor no other way .
well ,  when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ;  he ketched this piece of a raft ;  so we reckoned we'd go down to orleans on it .
pa's luck didn't hold out ;  a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night ,  and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ;  jim and me come up all right ,  but pa was drunk ,  and ike was only four years old ,  so they never come up no more .
well ,  for the next day or two we had considerable trouble ,  because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me ,  saying they believed he was a runaway nigger .
we don't run daytimes no more now ;  nights they don't bother us the duke says :  leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to .
i'll think the thing overi'll invent a plan that'll fix it .
we'll let it alone for today ,  because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylightit mightn't be healthy towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ;  the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky ,  and the leaves was beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly ,  it was easy to see that .
so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam ,  to see what the beds was like .
my bed was a straw tick better than jim's ,  which was a cornshuck tick ;  there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick ,  and they poke into you and hurt ;  and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ;  it makes such a rustling that you wake up .
well ,  the duke allowed he would take my bed ;  but the king allowed he wouldn't .
he says :  i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on .
your grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute ,  being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ;  so we was pretty glad when the duke says :  'tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression .
misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ;  i yield ,  i submit ;  'tis my fate .
i am alone in the worldlet me suffer ;  can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark .
the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river ,  and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town .
we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and bythat was the town ,  you knowand slid by ,  about a half a mile out ,  all right .
when we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ;  and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ;  so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ;  then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night .
it was my watch below till twelve ,  but i wouldn't a turned in anyway if i'd had a bed ,  because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week ,  not by a long sight .
my souls ,  how the wind did scream along !
and every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half a mile around ,  and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain ,  and the trees thrashing around in the wind ;  then comes a hwhackbum !
bum !
bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away ,  and quitand then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager .
the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes ,  but i hadn't any clothes on ,  and didn't mind .
we didn't have no trouble about snags ;  the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them .
i had the middle watch ,  you know ,  but i was pretty sleepy by that time ,  so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me ;  he was always mighty good that way ,  jim was .
i crawled into the wigwam ,  but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for me ;  so i laid outsidei didn't mind the rain ,  because it was warm ,  and the waves warn't running so high now .
about two they come up again ,  though ,  and jim was going to call me ;  but he changed his mind ,  because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm ;  but he was mistaken about that ,  for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard .
it most killed jim alaughing .
he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was ,  anyway .
i took the watch ,  and jim he laid down and snored away ;  and by and by the storm let up for good and all ;  and the first cabinlight that showed i rousted him out ,  and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day .
the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast ,  and him and the duke played sevenup a while ,  five cents a game .
then they got tired of it ,  and allowed they would lay out a campaign ,  as they called it .
the duke went down into his carpetbag ,  and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud .
one bill said ,  the celebrated dr .
armand de montalban ,  of paris ,  would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place ,  on the blank day of blank ,  at ten cents admission ,  and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece the duke said that was him .
in another bill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian ,  garrick the younger ,  of drury lane ,  london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things ,  like finding water and gold with a diviningrod ,  dissipating witch spells ,  and so on .
by and by he says :  but the histrionic muse is the darling .
have you ever trod the boards ,  royalty no ,  says the king .
you shall ,  then ,  before you're three days older ,  fallen grandeur ,  says the duke .
the first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii .
and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet .
how does that strike you i'm in ,  up to the hub ,  for anything that will pay ,  bilgewater ;  but ,  you see ,  i don't know nothing about playactin' ,  and hain't ever seen much of it .
i was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace .
do you reckon you can learn me easy all right .
i'm jist afreezn' for something fresh ,  anyway .
le's commence right away so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was ,  and said he was used to being romeo ,  so the king could be juliet .
but if juliet's such a young gal ,  duke ,  my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her ,  maybe no ,  don't you worry ;  these country jakes won't ever think of that .
besides ,  you know ,  you'll be in costume ,  and that makes all the difference in the world ;  juliet's in a balcony ,  enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed ,  and she's got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap .
here are the costumes for the parts he got out two or three curtaincalico suits ,  which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii .
and t'other chap ,  and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match .
the king was satisfied ;  so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way ,  prancing around and acting at the same time ,  to show how it had got to be done ;  then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart .
there was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend ,  and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim ;  so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing .
the king allowed he would go ,  too ,  and see if he couldn't strike something .
we was out of coffee ,  so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
when we got there there warn't nobody stirring ;  streets empty ,  and perfectly dead and still ,  like sunday .
we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard ,  and he said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting ,  about two mile back in the woods .
the king got the directions ,  and allowed he'd go and work that campmeeting for all it was worth ,  and i might go ,  too .
the duke said what he was after was a printingoffice .
we found it ;  a little bit of a concern ,  up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and printers all gone to the meeting ,  and no doors locked .
it was a dirty ,  litteredup place ,  and had ink marks ,  and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them ,  all over the walls .
the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now .
so me and the king lit out for the campmeeting .
we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping ,  for it was a most awful hot day .
there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around .
the woods was full of teams and wagons ,  hitched everywheres ,  feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies .
there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches ,  where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell ,  and piles of watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck .
the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds ,  only they was bigger and held crowds of people .
the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs ,  with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs .
they didn't have no backs .
the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds .
the women had on sunbonnets ;  and some had linseywoolsey frocks ,  some gingham ones ,  and a few of the young ones had on calico .
some of the young men was barefooted ,  and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt .
some of the old women was knitting ,  and some of the young folks was courting on the sly .
the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn .
he lined out two lines ,  everybody sung it ,  and it was kind of grand to hear it ,  there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ;  then he lined out two more for them to singand so on .
the people woke up more and more ,  and sung louder and louder ;  and towards the end some begun to groan ,  and some begun to shout .
then the preacher begun to preach ,  and begun in earnest ,  too ;  and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other ,  and then aleaning down over the front of it ,  with his arms and his body going all the time ,  and shouting his words out with all his might ;  and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open ,  and kind of pass it around this way and that ,  shouting ,  it's the brazen serpent in the wilderness !
look upon it and live and people would shout out ,  gloryaamen and so he went on ,  and the people groaning and crying and saying amen :  oh ,  come to the mourners' bench !
come ,  black with sin !
amen come ,  sick and sore !
amen come ,  lame and halt and blind !
amen come ,  pore and needy ,  sunk in shame !
aamen come ,  all that's worn and soiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit !
come with a contrite heart !
come in your rags and sin and dirt !
the waters that cleanse is free ,  the door of heaven stands openoh ,  enter in and be at rest aamen !
glory ,  glory hallelujah and so on .
you couldn't make out what the preacher said any more ,  on account of the shouting and crying .
folks got up everywheres in the crowd ,  and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench ,  with the tears running down their faces ;  and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd ,  they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw ,  just crazy and wild .
well ,  the first i knowed the king got agoing ,  and you could hear him over everybody ;  and next he went acharging up on to the platform ,  and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people ,  and he done it .
he told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the indian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight ,  and he was home now to take out some fresh men ,  and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent ,  and he was glad of it ;  it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him ,  because he was a changed man now ,  and happy for the first time in his life ;  and ,  poor as he was ,  he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean ,  and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ;  for he could do it better than anybody else ,  being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ;  and though it would take him a long time to get there without money ,  he would get there anyway ,  and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him ,  don't you thank me ,  don't you give me no credit ;  it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeeting ,  natural brothers and benefactors of the race ,  and that dear preacher there ,  the truest friend a pirate ever had and then he busted into tears ,  and so did everybody .
then somebody sings out ,  take up a collection for him ,  take up a collection well ,  a half a dozen made a jump to do it ,  but somebody sings out ,  let him pass the hat around then everybody said it ,  the preacher too .
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes ,  and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ;  and every little while the prettiest kind of girls ,  with the tears running down their cheeks ,  would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ;  and he always done it ;  and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six timesand he was invited to stay a week ;  and everybody wanted him to live in their houses ,  and said they'd think it was an honor ;  but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldn't do no good ,  and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents .
and then he had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky ,  too ,  that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods .
the king said ,  take it all around ,  it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the missionarying line .
he said it warn't no use talking ,  heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with .
the duke was thinking he'd been doing pretty well till the king come to show up ,  but after that he didn't think so so much .
he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse billsand took the money ,  four dollars .
and he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper ,  which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it .
the price of the paper was two dollars a year ,  but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ;  they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual ,  but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it ,  and was going to run it for cash .
he set up a little piece of poetry ,  which he made ,  himself ,  out of his own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was ,  yes ,  crush ,  cold world ,  this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper ,  and didn't charge nothing for it .
well ,  he took in nine dollars and a half ,  and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it .
then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for ,  because it was for us .
it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder ,  and  reward under it .
the reading was all about jim ,  and just described him to a dot .
it said he run away from st .
jacques' plantation ,  forty mile below new orleans ,  last winter ,  and likely went north ,  and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses .
now ,  says the duke ,  after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to .
whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope ,  and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river ,  and were too poor to travel on a steamboat ,  so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward .
handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim ,  but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor .
too much like jewelry .
ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities ,  as we say on the boards we all said the duke was pretty smart ,  and there couldn't be no trouble about running daytimes .
we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ;  then we could boom right along if we wanted to .
we laid low and kept still ,  and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ;  then we slid by ,  pretty wide away from the town ,  and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it .
when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning ,  he says :  huck ,  does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip no ,  i says ,  i reckon not well ,  says he ,  dat's all right ,  den .
i doan' mine one er two kings ,  but dat's enough .
dis one's powerful drunk ,  en de duke ain' much better i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french ,  so he could hear what it was like ;  but he said he had been in this country so long ,  and had so much trouble ,  he'd forgot it .
it was after sunup now ,  but we went right on and didn't tie up .
the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ;  but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal .
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft ,  and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches ,  and let his legs dangle in the water ,  so as to be comfortable ,  and lit his pipe ,  and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart .
when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together .
the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ;  and he made him sigh ,  and put his hand on his heart ,  and after a while he said he done it pretty well ;  only ,  he says ,  you mustn't bellow out romeo !
that way ,  like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy ,  soroomeo !
that is the idea ;  for juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl ,  you know ,  and she doesn't bray like a jackass well ,  next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths ,  and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii ;  and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see .
but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard ,  and after that they took a rest ,  and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river .
after dinner the duke says :  well ,  capet ,  we'll want to make this a firstclass show ,  you know ,  so i guess we'll add a little more to it .
we want a little something to answer encores with ,  anyway what's onkores ,  bilgewater the duke told him ,  and then says :  i'll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe ;  and youwell ,  let me seeoh ,  i've got ityou can do hamlet's soliloquy hamlet's which hamlet's soliloquy ,  you know ;  the most celebrated thing in shakespeare .
ah ,  it's sublime ,  sublime !
always fetches the house .
i haven't got it in the booki've only got one volumebut i reckon i can piece it out from memory .
i'll just walk up and down a minute ,  and see if i can call it back from recollection's vaults so he went to marching up and down ,  thinking ,  and frowning horrible every now and then ;  then he would hoist up his eyebrows ;  next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ;  next he would sigh ,  and next he'd let on to drop a tear .
it was beautiful to see him .
by and by he got it .
he told us to give attention .
then he strikes a most noble attitude ,  with one leg shoved forwards ,  and his arms stretched away up ,  and his head tilted back ,  looking up at the sky ;  and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ;  and after that ,  all through his speech ,  he howled ,  and spread around ,  and swelled up his chest ,  and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before .
this is the speechi learned it ,  easy enough ,  while he was learning it to the king :  to be ,  or not to be ;  that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life ;  for who would fardels bear ,  till birnam wood do come to dunsinane ,  but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep ,  great nature's second course ,  and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of .
there's the respect must give us pause :  wake duncan with thy knocking !
i would thou couldst ;  for who would bear the whips and scorns of time ,  the oppressor's wrong ,  the proud man's contumely ,  the law's delay ,  and the quietus which his pangs might take .
in the dead waste and middle of the night ,  when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black ,  but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns ,  breathes forth contagion on the world ,  and thus the native hue of resolution ,  like the poor cat i' the adage ,  is sicklied o'er with care .
and all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops ,  with this regard their currents turn awry ,  and lose the name of action .
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
but soft you ,  the fair ophelia :  ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws .
but get thee to a nunnerymdash ; go !
well ,  the old man he liked that speech ,  and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate .
it seemed like he was just born for it ;  and when he had his hand in and was excited ,  it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off .
the first chance we got ,  the duke he had some show bills printed ;  and after that ,  for two or three days as we floated along ,  the raft was a most uncommon lively place ,  for there warn't nothing but swordfighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time .
one morning ,  when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw ,  we come in sight of a little onehorse town in a big bend ;  so we tied up about threequarters of a mile above it ,  in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees ,  and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show .
we struck it mighty lucky ;  there was going to be a circus there that afternoon ,  and the country people was already beginning to come in ,  in all kinds of old shackly wagons ,  and on horses .
the circus would leave before night ,  so our show would have a pretty good chance .
the duke he hired the court house ,  and we went around and stuck up our bills .
they read like this :  shaksperean revival !

then we went loafing around the town .
the stores and houses was most all old shackly driedup frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted ;  they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts ,  so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed .
the houses had little gardens around them ,  but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds ,  and sunflowers ,  and ashpiles ,  and old curledup boots and shoes ,  and pieces of bottles ,  and rags ,  and playedout tinware .
the fences was made of different kinds of boards ,  nailed on at different times ;  and they leaned every whichway ,  and had gates that didn't generly have but one hingea leather one .
some of the fences had been whitewashed ,  some time or another ,  but the duke said it was in clumbus's time ,  like enough .
there was generly hogs in the garden ,  and people driving them out .
all the stores was along one street .
they had white domestic awnings in front ,  and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts .
there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings ,  and loafers roosting on them all day long ,  whittling them with their barlow knives ;  and chawing tobacco ,  and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot .
they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella ,  but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats ,  they called one another bill ,  and buck ,  and hank ,  and joe ,  and andy ,  and talked lazy and drawly ,  and used considerable many cuss words .
there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awningpost ,  and he most always had his hands in his britchespockets ,  except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch .
what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was :  gimme a chaw 'v tobacker ,  hank cain't ;  i hain't got but one chaw left .
ask bill maybe bill he gives him a chaw ;  maybe he lies and says he ain't got none .
some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world ,  nor a chaw of tobacco of their own .
they get all their chawing by borrowing ;  they say to a fellow ,  i wisht you'd len' me a chaw ,  jack ,  i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime ;  it don't fool nobody but a stranger ;  but jack ain't no stranger ,  so he says :  you give him a chaw ,  did you ?
so did your sister's cat's grandmother .
you pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me ,  lafe buckner ,  then i'll loan you one or two ton of it ,  and won't charge you no back intrust ,  nuther well ,  i did pay you back some of it wunst yes ,  you did'bout six chaws .
you borry'd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead store tobacco is flat black plug ,  but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted .
when they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife ,  but set the plug in between their teeth ,  and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ;  then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back ,  and says ,  sarcastic :  here ,  gimme the chaw ,  and you take the plug all the streets and lanes was just mud ;  they warn't nothing else but mudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places ,  and two or three inches deep in all the places .
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres .
you'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way ,  where folks had to walk around her ,  and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her ,  and look as happy as if she was on salary .
and pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out ,  hi !
so boy !
sick him ,  tige and away the sow would go ,  squealing most horrible ,  with a dog or two swinging to each ear ,  and three or four dozen more acoming ;  and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight ,  and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise .
then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight .
there couldn't anything wake them up all over ,  and make them happy all over ,  like a dog fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him ,  or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death .
on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank ,  and they was bowed and bent ,  and about ready to tumble in .
the people had moved out of them .
the bank was caved away under one corner of some others ,  and that corner was hanging over .
people lived in them yet ,  but it was dangersome ,  because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time .
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer .
such a town as that has to be always moving back ,  and back ,  and back ,  because the river's always gnawing at it .
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets ,  and more coming all the time .
families fetched their dinners with them from the country ,  and eat them in the wagons .
there was considerable whisky drinking going on ,  and i seen three fights .
by and by somebody sings out :  here comes old boggsin from the country for his little old monthly drunk ;  here he comes ,  boys all the loafers looked glad ;  i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs .
one of them says :  wonder who he's agwyne to chaw up this time .
if he'd achawed up all the men he's ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now another one says ,  i wisht old boggs 'd threaten me ,  'cuz then i'd know i warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year boggs comes atearing along on his horse ,  whooping and yelling like an injun ,  and singing out :  cler the track ,  thar .
i'm on the wawpath ,  and the price uv coffins is agwyne to raise he was drunk ,  and weaving about in his saddle ;  he was over fifty year old ,  and had a very red face .
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him ,  and he sassed back ,  and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns ,  but he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old colonel sherburn ,  and his motto was ,  meat first ,  and spoon vittles to top off on he see me ,  and rode up and says :  whar'd you come f'm ,  boy ?
you prepared to die then he rode on .
i was scared ,  but a man says :  he don't mean nothing ;  he's always acarryin' on like that when he's drunk .
he's the best naturedest old fool in arkansawnever hurt nobody ,  drunk nor sober boggs rode up before the biggest store in town ,  and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells :  come out here ,  sherburn !
come out and meet the man you've swindled .
you're the houn' i'm after ,  and i'm agwyne to have you ,  too and so he went on ,  calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to ,  and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on .
by and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a heap the best dressed man in that town ,  toosteps out of the store ,  and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come .
he says to boggs ,  mighty ca'm and slowhe says :  i'm tired of this ,  but i'll endure it till one o'clock .
till one o'clock ,  mindno longer .
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but i will find you then he turns and goes in .
the crowd looked mighty sober ;  nobody stirred ,  and there warn't no more laughing .
boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell ,  all down the street ;  and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store ,  still keeping it up .
some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up ,  but he wouldn't ;  they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes ,  and so he must go homehe must go right away .
but it didn't do no good .
he cussed away with all his might ,  and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it ,  and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again ,  with his gray hair aflying .
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ;  but it warn't no useup the street he would tear again ,  and give sherburn another cussing .
by and by somebody says :  go for his daughterquick ,  go for his daughter ;  sometimes he'll listen to her .
if anybody can persuade him ,  she can so somebody started on a run .
i walked down street a ways and stopped .
in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again ,  but not on his horse .
he was areeling across the street towards me ,  bareheaded ,  with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along .
he was quiet ,  and looked uneasy ;  and he warn't hanging back any ,  but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
somebody sings out :  boggs i looked over there to see who said it ,  and it was that colonel sherburn .
he was standing perfectly still in the street ,  and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it ,  but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky .
the same second i see a young girl coming on the run ,  and two men with her .
boggs and the men turned round to see who called him ,  and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side ,  and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels cocked .
boggs throws up both of his hands and says ,  o lord ,  don't shoot bang !
goes the first shot ,  and he staggers back ,  clawing at the airbang !
goes the second one ,  and he tumbles backwards on to the ground ,  heavy and solid ,  with his arms spread out .
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing ,  and down she throws herself on her father ,  crying ,  and saying ,  oh ,  he's killed him ,  he's killed him the crowd closed up around them ,  and shouldered and jammed one another ,  with their necks stretched ,  trying to see ,  and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting ,  back ,  back !
give him air ,  give him air colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground ,  and turned around on his heels and walked off .
they took boggs to a little drug store ,  the crowd pressing around just the same ,  and the whole town following ,  and i rushed and got a good place at the window ,  where i was close to him and could see in .
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head ,  and opened another one and spread it on his breast ;  but they tore open his shirt first ,  and i seen where one of the bullets went in .
he made about a dozen long gasps ,  his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath ,  and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid still ;  he was dead .
then they pulled his daughter away from him ,  screaming and crying ,  and took her off .
she was about sixteen ,  and very sweet and gentle looking ,  but awful pale and scared .
well ,  pretty soon the whole town was there ,  squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look ,  but people that had the places wouldn't give them up ,  and folks behind them was saying all the time ,  say ,  now ,  you've looked enough ,  you fellows ;  'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time ,  and never give nobody a chance ;  other folks has their rights as well as you there was considerable jawing back ,  so i slid out ,  thinking maybe there was going to be trouble .
the streets was full ,  and everybody was excited .
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened ,  and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows ,  stretching their necks and listening .
one long ,  lanky man ,  with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head ,  and a crookedhandled cane ,  marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood ,  and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done ,  and bobbing their heads to show they understood ,  and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ;  and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood ,  frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes ,  and sung out ,  boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level ,  and says bang staggered backwards ,  says bang again ,  and fell down flat on his back .
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ;  said it was just exactly the way it all happened .
then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him .
well ,  by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched .
in about a minute everybody was saying it ;  so away they went ,  mad and yelling ,  and snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with .
they swarmed up towards sherburn's house ,  awhooping and raging like injuns ,  and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush ,  and it was awful to see .
children was heeling it ahead of the mob ,  screaming and trying to get out of the way ;  and every window along the road was full of women's heads ,  and there was nigger boys in every tree ,  and bucks and wenches looking over every fence ;  and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach .
lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on ,  scared most to death .
they swarmed up in front of sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together ,  and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise .
it was a little twentyfoot yard .
some sung out tear down the fence !
tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing ,  and down she goes ,  and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave .
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch ,  with a doublebarrel gun in his hand ,  and takes his stand ,  perfectly ca'm and deliberate ,  not saying a word .
the racket stopped ,  and the wave sucked back .
sherburn never said a wordjust stood there ,  looking down .
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable .
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ;  and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him ,  but they couldn't ;  they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky .
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed ;  not the pleasant kind ,  but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it .
then he says ,  slow and scornful :  the idea of you lynching anybody !
it's amusing .
the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man !
because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here ,  did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man ?
why ,  a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as it's daytime and you're not behind him .
do i know you ?
i know you clear through .
i was born and raised in the south ,  and i've lived in the north ;  so i know the average all around .
the average man's a coward .
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to ,  and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it .
in the south one man all by himself ,  has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime ,  and robbed the lot .
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas you're just as brave ,  and no braver .
why don't your juries hang murderers ?
because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back ,  in the darkand it's just what they would do .
so they always acquit ;  and then a man goes in the night ,  with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal .
your mistake is ,  that you didn't bring a man with you ;  that's one mistake ,  and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks .
you brought part of a manbuck harkness ,  thereand if you hadn't had him to start you ,  you'd a taken it out in blowing .
you didn't want to come .
the average man don't like trouble and danger .
you don't like trouble and danger .
but if only half a manlike buck harkness ,  thereshouts 'lynch him !
lynch him' you're afraid to back downafraid you'll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you raise a yell ,  and hang yourselves on to that halfaman's coattail ,  and come raging up here ,  swearing what big things you're going to do .
the pitifulest thing out is a mob ;  that's what an army isa mob ;  they don't fight with courage that's born in them ,  but with courage that's borrowed from their mass ,  and from their officers .
but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness .
now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole .
if any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark ,  southern fashion ;  and when they come they'll bring their masks ,  and fetch a man along .
now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this .
the crowd washed back sudden ,  and then broke all apart ,  and went tearing off every which way ,  and buck harkness he heeled it after them ,  looking tolerable cheap .
i could a stayed if i wanted to ,  but i didn't want to .
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by ,  and then dived in under the tent .
i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money ,  but i reckoned i better save it ,  because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it ,  away from home and amongst strangers that way .
you can't be too careful .
i ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way ,  but there ain't no use in wasting it on them .
it was a real bully circus .
it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in ,  two and two ,  a gentleman and lady ,  side by side ,  the men just in their drawers and undershirts ,  and no shoes nor stirrups ,  and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely complexion ,  and perfectly beautiful ,  and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens ,  and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars ,  and just littered with diamonds .
it was a powerful fine sight ;  i never see anything so lovely .
and then one by one they got up and stood ,  and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful ,  the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight ,  with their heads bobbing and skimming along ,  away up there under the tentroof ,  and every lady's roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips ,  and she looking like the most loveliest parasol .
and then faster and faster they went ,  all of them dancing ,  first one foot out in the air and then the other ,  the horses leaning more and more ,  and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole ,  cracking his whip and shouting hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him ;  and by and by all hands dropped the reins ,  and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms ,  and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves !
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring ,  and made the sweetest bow i ever see ,  and then scampered out ,  and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild .
well ,  all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ;  and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people .
the ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ;  and how he ever could think of so many of them ,  and so sudden and so pat ,  was what i couldn't noway understand .
why ,  i couldn't a thought of them in a year .
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to ride ;  said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was .
they argued and tried to keep him out ,  but he wouldn't listen ,  and the whole show come to a standstill .
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him ,  and that made him mad ,  and he begun to rip and tear ;  so that stirred up the people ,  and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring ,  saying ,  knock him down !
throw him out and one or two women begun to scream .
so ,  then ,  the ringmaster he made a little speech ,  and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance ,  and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse .
so everybody laughed and said all right ,  and the man got on .
the minute he was on ,  the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around ,  with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him ,  and the drunk man hanging on to his neck ,  and his heels flying in the air every jump ,  and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down .
and at last ,  sure enough ,  all the circus men could do ,  the horse broke loose ,  and away he went like the very nation ,  round and round the ring ,  with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck ,  with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side ,  and then t'other one on t'other side ,  and the people just crazy .
it warn't funny to me ,  though ;  i was all of a tremble to see his danger .
but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle ,  areeling this way and that ;  and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood !
and the horse agoing like a house afire too .
he just stood up there ,  asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them .
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air ,  and altogether he shed seventeen suits .
and ,  then ,  there he was ,  slim and handsome ,  and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw ,  and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off ,  and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom ,  and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment .
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled ,  and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see ,  i reckon .
why ,  it was one of his own men !
he had got up that joke all out of his own head ,  and never let on to nobody .
well ,  i felt sheepish enough to be took in so ,  but i wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place ,  not for a thousand dollars .
i don't know ;  there may be bullier circuses than what that one was ,  but i never struck them yet .
anyways ,  it was plenty good enough for me ;  and wherever i run across it ,  it can have all of my custom every time .
well ,  that night we had our show ;  but there warn't only about twelve people therejust enough to pay expenses .
and they laughed all the time ,  and that made the duke mad ;  and everybody left ,  anyway ,  before the show was over ,  but one boy which was asleep .
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to shakespeare ;  what they wanted was low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy ,  he reckoned .
he said he could size their style .
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint ,  and drawed off some handbills ,  and stuck them up all over the village .
the bills said :  well ,  all day him and the king was hard at it ,  rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights ;  and that night the house was jam full of men in no time .
when the place couldn't hold no more ,  the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech ,  and praised up this tragedy ,  and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was ;  and so he went on abragging about the tragedy ,  and about edmund kean the elder ,  which was to play the main principal part in it ;  and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough ,  he rolled up the curtain ,  and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours ,  naked ;  and he was painted all over ,  ringstreakedandstriped ,  all sorts of colors ,  as splendid as a rainbow .
andbut never mind the rest of his outfit ;  it was just wild ,  but it was awful funny .
the people most killed themselves laughing ;  and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes ,  they roared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again ,  and after that they made him do it another time .
well ,  it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut .
then the duke he lets the curtain down ,  and bows to the people ,  and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more ,  on accounts of pressing london engagements ,  where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane ;  and then he makes them another bow ,  and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them ,  he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it .
twenty people sings out :  what ,  is it over ?
is that all the duke says yes .
then there was a fine time .
everybody sings out ,  sold and rose up mad ,  and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians .
but a big ,  fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts :  hold on !
just a word ,  gentlemen they stopped to listen .
we are soldmighty badly sold .
but we don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town ,  i reckon ,  and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live .
no .
what we want is to go out of here quiet ,  and talk this show up ,  and sell the rest of the town !
then we'll all be in the same boat .
ain't that sensible you bet it isthe jedge is right everybody sings out all right ,  thennot a word about any sell .
go along home ,  and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was .
house was jammed again that night ,  and we sold this crowd the same way .
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ;  and by and by ,  about midnight ,  they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river ,  and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town .
the third night the house was crammed againand they warn't newcomers this time ,  but people that was at the show the other two nights .
i stood by the duke at the door ,  and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging ,  or something muffled up under his coatand i see it warn't no perfumery ,  neither ,  not by a long sight .
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel ,  and rotten cabbages ,  and such things ;  and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around ,  and i bet i do ,  there was sixtyfour of them went in .
i shoved in there for a minute ,  but it was too various for me ;  i couldn't stand it .
well ,  when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute ,  and then he started around for the stage door ,  i after him ;  but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says :  walk fast now till you get away from the houses ,  and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you i done it ,  and he done the same .
we struck the raft at the same time ,  and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream ,  all dark and still ,  and edging towards the middle of the river ,  nobody saying a word .
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience ,  but nothing of the sort ;  pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam ,  and says :  well ,  how'd the old thing pan out this time ,  duke he hadn't been uptown at all .
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village .
then we lit up and had a supper ,  and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people .
the duke says :  greenhorns ,  flatheads !
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ;  and i knew they'd lay for us the third night ,  and consider it was their turn now .
well ,  it is their turn ,  and i'd give something to know how much they'd take for it .
i would just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity .
they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that three nights .
i never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before .
by and by ,  when they was asleep and snoring ,  jim says :  don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on ,  huck no ,  i says ,  it don't why don't it ,  huck well ,  it don't ,  because it's in the breed .
i reckon they're all alike but ,  huck ,  dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions ;  dat's jist what dey is ;  dey's reglar rapscallions well ,  that's what i'm asaying ;  all kings is mostly rapscallions ,  as fur as i can make out is dat so you read about them onceyou'll see .
look at henry the eight ;  this 'n 's a sundayschool superintendent to him .
and look at charles second ,  and louis fourteen ,  and louis fifteen ,  and james second ,  and edward second ,  and richard third ,  and forty more ;  besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain .
my ,  you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom .
he was a blossom .
he used to marry a new wife every day ,  and chop off her head next morning .
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs .
'fetch up nell gwynn , ' he says .
they fetch her up .
next morning ,  'chop off her head' and they chop it off .
'fetch up jane shore , ' he says ;  and up she comes ,  next morning ,  'chop off her head'and they chop it off .
'ring up fair rosamun' fair rosamun answers the bell .
next morning ,  'chop off her head' and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night ;  and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way ,  and then he put them all in a book ,  and called it domesday bookwhich was a good name and stated the case .
you don't know kings ,  jim ,  but i know them ;  and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i've struck in history .
well ,  henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country .
how does he go at itgive noticegive the country a show ?
no .
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard ,  and whacks out a declaration of independence ,  and dares them to come on .
that was his stylehe never give anybody a chance .
he had suspicions of his father ,  the duke of wellington .
well ,  what did he do ?
ask him to show up ?
nodrownded him in a butt of mamsey ,  like a cat .
s'pose people left money laying around where he waswhat did he do ?
he collared it .
s'pose he contracted to do a thing ,  and you paid him ,  and didn't set down there and see that he done itwhat did he do ?
he always done the other thing .
s'pose he opened his mouthwhat then ?
if he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time .
that's the kind of a bug henry was ;  and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done .
i don't say that ourn is lambs ,  because they ain't ,  when you come right down to the cold facts ;  but they ain't nothing to that old ram ,  anyway .
all i say is ,  kings is kings ,  and you got to make allowances .
take them all around ,  they're a mighty ornery lot .
it's the way they're raised but dis one do smell so like de nation ,  huck well ,  they all do ,  jim .
we can't help the way a king smells ;  history don't tell no way now de duke ,  he's a tolerble likely man in some ways yes ,  a duke's different .
but not very different .
this one's a middling hard lot for a duke .
when he's drunk there ain't no nearsighted man could tell him from a king well ,  anyways ,  i doan' hanker for no mo' un um ,  huck .
dese is all i kin stan' it's the way i feel ,  too ,  jim .
but we've got them on our hands ,  and we got to remember what they are ,  and make allowances .
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings what was the use to tell jim these warn't real kings and dukes ?
it wouldn't a done no good ;  and ,  besides ,  it was just as i said :  you couldn't tell them from the real kind .
i went to sleep ,  and jim didn't call me when it was my turn .
he often done that .
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees ,  moaning and mourning to himself .
i didn't take notice nor let on .
i knowed what it was about .
he was thinking about his wife and his children ,  away up yonder ,  and he was low and homesick ;  because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life ;  and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n .
it don't seem natural ,  but i reckon it's so .
he was often moaning and mourning that way nights ,  when he judged i was asleep ,  and saying ,  po' little 'lizabeth !
po' little johnny !
it's mighty hard ;  i spec' i ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo' ,  no mo' he was a mighty good nigger ,  jim was .
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones ;  and by and by he says :  what makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack ,  er a slam ,  while ago ,  en it mine me er de time i treat my little 'lizabeth so ornery .
she warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole ,  en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever ,  en had a powful rough spell ;  but she got well ,  en one day she was astannin' aroun' ,  en i says to her ,  i says :  'shet de do'' she never done it ;  jis' stood dah ,  kiner smilin' up at me .
it make me mad ;  en i says agin ,  mighty loud ,  i says :  'doan' you hear me ?
shet de do'' she jis stood de same way ,  kiner smilin' up .
i was abilin' !
i says :  'i lay i make you mine' en wid dat i fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her asprawlin' .
den i went into de yuther room ,  en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes ;  en when i come back dah was dat do' astannin' open yit ,  en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it ,  alookin' down and mournin' ,  en de tears runnin' down .
my ,  but i wuz mad !
i was agwyne for de chile ,  but jis' denit was a do' dat open innerdsjis' den ,  'long come de wind en slam it to ,  behine de chile ,  kerblamen my lan' ,  de chile never move' !
my breff mos' hop outer me ;  en i feel sosoi doan' know how i feel .
i crope out ,  all atremblin' ,  en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow ,  en poke my head in behine de chile ,  sof' en still ,  en all uv a sudden i says pow !
jis' as loud as i could yell .
she never budge oh ,  huck ,  i bust out acryin' en grab her up in my arms ,  en say ,  'oh ,  de po' little thing !
de lord god amighty fogive po' ole jim ,  kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long's he live' oh ,  she was plumb deef en dumb ,  huck ,  plumb deef en dumben i'd ben atreat'n her so next day ,  towards night ,  we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle ,  where there was a village on each side of the river ,  and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns .
jim he spoke to the duke ,  and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours ,  because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope .
you see ,  when we left him all alone we had to tie him ,  because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger ,  you know .
so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day ,  and he'd cipher out some way to get around it .
he was uncommon bright ,  the duke was ,  and he soon struck it .
he dressed jim up in king lear's outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown ,  and a white horsehair wig and whiskers ;  and then he took his theater paint and painted jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead ,  dull ,  solid blue ,  like a man that's been drownded nine days .
blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking outrage i ever see .
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so :  sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head .
and he nailed that shingle to a lath ,  and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam .
jim was satisfied .
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day ,  and trembling all over every time there was a sound .
the duke told him to make himself free and easy ,  and if anybody ever come meddling around ,  he must hop out of the wigwam ,  and carry on a little ,  and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast ,  and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone .
which was sound enough judgment ;  but you take the average man ,  and he wouldn't wait for him to howl .
why ,  he didn't only look like he was dead ,  he looked considerable more than that .
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again ,  because there was so much money in it ,  but they judged it wouldn't be safe ,  because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time .
they couldn't hit no project that suited exactly ;  so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the arkansaw village ;  and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan ,  but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil ,  i reckon .
we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last ;  and now the king put his'n on ,  and he told me to put mine on .
i done it ,  of course .
the king's duds was all black ,  and he did look real swell and starchy .
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before .
why ,  before ,  he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was ;  but now ,  when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile ,  he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark ,  and maybe was old leviticus himself .
jim cleaned up the canoe ,  and i got my paddle ready .
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point ,  about three mile above the townbeen there a couple of hours ,  taking on freight .
says the king :  seein' how i'm dressed ,  i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st .
louis or cincinnati ,  or some other big place .
go for the steamboat ,  huckleberry ;  we'll come down to the village on her i didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride .
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village ,  and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water .
pretty soon we come to a nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face ,  for it was powerful warm weather ;  and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him .
run her nose in shore ,  says the king .
i done it .
wher' you bound for ,  young man for the steamboat ;  going to orleans git aboard ,  says the king .
hold on a minute ,  my servant 'll he'p you with them bags .
jump out and he'p the gentleman ,  adolphusmeaning me ,  i see .
i done so ,  and then we all three started on again .
the young chap was mighty thankful ;  said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather .
he asked the king where he was going ,  and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning ,  and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there .
the young fellow says :  when i first see you i says to myself ,  'it's mr. wilks ,  sure ,  and he come mighty near getting here in time' but then i says again ,  'no ,  i reckon it ain't him ,  or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river' you ain't him ,  are you no ,  my name's blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexander blodgett ,  i s'pose i must say ,  as i'm one o' the lord's poor servants .
but still i'm jist as able to be sorry for mr. wilks for not arriving in time ,  all the same ,  if he's missed anything by itwhich i hope he hasn't well ,  he don't miss any property by it ,  because he'll get that all right ;  but he's missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he mayn't mind ,  nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died ;  never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ;  hadn't seen him since they was boys togetherand hadn't ever seen his brother william at allthat's the deef and dumb onewilliam ain't more than thirty or thirtyfive .
peter and george were the only ones that come out here ;  george was the married brother ;  him and his wife both died last year .
harvey and william's the only ones that's left now ;  and ,  as i was saying ,  they haven't got here in time did anybody send 'em word oh ,  yes ;  a month or two ago ,  when peter was first took ;  because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time .
you see ,  he was pretty old ,  and george's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him ,  except mary jane ,  the redheaded one ;  and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died ,  and didn't seem to care much to live .
he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william ,  too ,  for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will .
he left a letter behind for harvey ,  and said he'd told in it where his money was hid ,  and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so george's g'yirls would be all rightfor george didn't leave nothing .
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to why do you reckon harvey don't come ?
wher' does he live oh ,  he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasn't ever been in this country .
he hasn't had any too much timeand besides he mightn't a got the letter at all ,  you know too bad ,  too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers ,  poor soul .
you going to orleans ,  you say yes ,  but that ain't only a part of it .
i'm going in a ship ,  next wednesday ,  for ryo janeero ,  where my uncle lives it's a pretty long journey .
but it'll be lovely ;  wisht i was agoing .
is mary jane the oldest ?
how old is the others mary jane's nineteen ,  susan's fifteen ,  and joanna's about fourteenthat's the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip poor things !
to be left alone in the cold world so well ,  they could be worse off .
old peter had friends ,  and they ain't going to let them come to no harm .
there's hobson ,  the babtis' preacher ;  and deacon lot hovey ,  and ben rucker ,  and abner shackleford ,  and levi bell ,  the lawyer ;  and dr .
robinson ,  and their wives ,  and the widow bartley ,  andwell ,  there's a lot of them ;  but these are the ones that peter was thickest with ,  and used to write about sometimes ,  when he wrote home ;  so harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here well ,  the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow .
blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town ,  and all about the wilkses ;  and about peter's businesswhich was a tanner ;  and about george'swhich was a carpenter ;  and about harvey'swhich was a dissentering minister ;  and so on ,  and so on .
then he says :  what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because she's a big orleans boat ,  and i was afeard she mightn't stop there .
when they're deep they won't stop for a hail .
a cincinnati boat will ,  but this is a st .
louis one was peter wilks well off oh ,  yes ,  pretty well off .
he had houses and land ,  and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers when did you say he died i didn't say ,  but it was last night funeral tomorrow ,  likely yes ,  'bout the middle of the day well ,  it's all terrible sad ;  but we've all got to go ,  one time or another .
so what we want to do is to be prepared ;  then we're all right yes ,  sir ,  it's the best way .
ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading ,  and pretty soon she got off .
the king never said nothing about going aboard ,  so i lost my ride ,  after all .
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place ,  and then he got ashore and says :  now hustle back ,  right off ,  and fetch the duke up here ,  and the new carpetbags .
and if he's gone over to t'other side ,  go over there and git him .
and tell him to git himself up regardless .
shove along ,  now i see what he was up to ;  but i never said nothing ,  of course .
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe ,  and then they set down on a log ,  and the king told him everything ,  just like the young fellow had said itevery last word of it .
and all the time he was adoing it he tried to talk like an englishman ;  and he done it pretty well ,  too ,  for a slouch .
i can't imitate him ,  and so i ain't agoing to try to ;  but he really done it pretty good .
then he says :  how are you on the deef and dumb ,  bilgewater the duke said ,  leave him alone for that ;  said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards .
so then they waited for a steamboat .
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along ,  but they didn't come from high enough up the river ;  but at last there was a big one ,  and they hailed her .
she sent out her yawl ,  and we went aboard ,  and she was from cincinnati ;  and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad ,  and gave us a cussing ,  and said they wouldn't land us .
but the king was ca'm .
he says :  if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl ,  a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em ,  can't it so they softened down and said it was all right ;  and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore .
about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl acoming ,  and when the king says :  kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' mr. peter wilks lives they give a glance at one another ,  and nodded their heads ,  as much as to say ,  what d' i tell you then one of them says ,  kind of soft and gentle :  i'm sorry sir ,  but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash ,  and fell up against the man ,  and put his chin on his shoulder ,  and cried down his back ,  and says :  alas ,  alas ,  our poor brothergone ,  and we never got to see him ;  oh ,  it's too ,  too hard then he turns around ,  blubbering ,  and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands ,  and blamed if he didn't drop a carpetbag and bust out acrying .
if they warn't the beatenest lot ,  them two frauds ,  that ever i struck .
well ,  the men gathered around and sympathized with them ,  and said all sorts of kind things to them ,  and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them ,  and let them lean on them and cry ,  and told the king all about his brother's last moments ,  and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke ,  and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples .
well ,  if ever i struck anything like it ,  i'm a nigger .
it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race .
the news was all over town in two minutes ,  and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way ,  some of them putting on their coats as they come .
pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd ,  and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march .
the windows and dooryards was full ;  and every minute somebody would say ,  over a fence :  is it them and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say :  you bet it is when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed ,  and the three girls was standing in the door .
mary jane was redheaded ,  but that don't make no difference ,  she was most awful beautiful ,  and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory ,  she was so glad her uncles was come .
the king he spread his arms ,  and mary jane she jumped for them ,  and the harelip jumped for the duke ,  and there they had it !
everybody most ,  leastways women ,  cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times .
then the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then he looked around and see the coffin ,  over in the corner on two chairs ;  so then him and the duke ,  with a hand across each other's shoulder ,  and t'other hand to their eyes ,  walked slow and solemn over there ,  everybody dropping back to give them room ,  and all the talk and noise stopping ,  people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads ,  so you could a heard a pin fall .
and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin ,  and took one sight ,  and then they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans ,  most ;  and then they put their arms around each other's necks ,  and hung their chins over each other's shoulders ;  and then for three minutes ,  or maybe four ,  i never see two men leak the way they done .
and ,  mind you ,  everybody was doing the same ;  and the place was that damp i never see anything like it .
then one of them got on one side of the coffin ,  and t'other on t'other side ,  and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin ,  and let on to pray all to themselves .
well ,  when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it ,  and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls ,  too ;  and every woman ,  nearly ,  went up to the girls ,  without saying a word ,  and kissed them ,  solemn ,  on the forehead ,  and then put their hand on their head ,  and looked up towards the sky ,  with the tears running down ,  and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing ,  and give the next woman a show .
i never see anything so disgusting .
well ,  by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little ,  and works himself up and slobbers out a speech ,  all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased ,  and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile ,  but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears ,  and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart ,  because out of their mouths they can't ,  words being too weak and cold ,  and all that kind of rot and slush ,  till it was just sickening ;  and then he blubbers out a pious goodygoody amen ,  and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust .
and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer ,  and everybody joined in with all their might ,  and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out .
music is a good thing ;  and after all that soulbutter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so ,  and sound so honest and bully .
then the king begins to work his jaw again ,  and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening ,  and help set up with the ashes of the diseased ;  and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name ,  for they was names that was very dear to him ,  and mentioned often in his letters ;  and so he will name the same ,  to wit ,  as follows ,  vizz : rev .
mr. hobson ,  and deacon lot hovey ,  and mr. ben rucker ,  and abner shackleford ,  and levi bell ,  and dr .
robinson ,  and their wives ,  and the widow bartley .
rev .
hobson and dr .
robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting togetherthat is ,  i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world ,  and the preacher was pinting him right .
lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business .
but the rest was on hand ,  and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him ;  and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing ,  but just kept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time ,  like a baby that can't talk .
so the king he blattered along ,  and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town ,  by his name ,  and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town ,  or to george's family ,  or to peter .
and he always let on that peter wrote him the things ;  but that was a lie :  he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat .
then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind ,  and the king he read it out loud and cried over it .
it give the dwellinghouse and three thousand dollars ,  gold ,  to the girls ;  and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business ,  along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand ,  and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william ,  and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar .
so these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up ,  and have everything square and aboveboard ;  and told me to come with a candle .
we shut the cellar door behind us ,  and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor ,  and it was a lovely sight ,  all them yallerboys .
my ,  the way the king's eyes did shine !
he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says :  oh ,  this ain't bully nor noth'n !
oh ,  no ,  i reckon not !
why ,  bully ,  it beats the nonesuch ,  don't it the duke allowed it did .
they pawed the yallerboys ,  and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor ;  and the king says :  it ain't no use talkin' ;  bein' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and me ,  bilge .
thish yer comes of trust'n to providence .
it's the best way ,  in the long run .
i've tried 'em all ,  and ther' ain't no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile ,  and took it on trust ;  but no ,  they must count it .
so they counts it ,  and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short .
says the king :  dern him ,  i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars they worried over that awhile ,  and ransacked all around for it .
then the duke says :  well ,  he was a pretty sick man ,  and likely he made a mistakei reckon that's the way of it .
the best way's to let it go ,  and keep still about it .
we can spare it oh ,  shucks ,  yes ,  we can spare it .
i don't k'yer noth'n 'bout thatit's the count i'm thinkin' about .
we want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here ,  you know .
we want to lug this hyer money up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther' ain't noth'n suspicious .
but when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars ,  you know ,  we don't want to hold on ,  says the duke .
le's make up the deffisit ,  and he begun to haul out yallerboys out of his pocket .
it's a most amaz'n' good idea ,  dukeyou have got a rattlin' clever head on you ,  says the king .
blest if the old nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin ,  and he begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up .
it most busted them ,  but they made up the six thousand clean and clear .
say ,  says the duke ,  i got another idea .
le's go up stairs and count this money ,  and then take and give it to the girls good land ,  duke ,  lemme hug you !
it's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck .
you have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head i ever see .
oh ,  this is the boss dodge ,  ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it .
let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis 'll lay 'em out when we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table ,  and the king he counted it and stacked it up ,  three hundred dollars in a piletwenty elegant little piles .
everybody looked hungry at it ,  and licked their chops .
then they raked it into the bag again ,  and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech .
he says :  friends all ,  my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers .
he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered ,  and that's left fatherless and motherless .
yes ,  and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear william and me .
now ,  wouldn't he ?
ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind .
well ,  then ,  what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time ?
and what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd robyes ,  robsech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time ?
if i know williamand i think i dohewell ,  i'll jest ask him he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands ,  and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while ;  then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning ,  and jumps for the king ,  googooing with all his might for joy ,  and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up .
then the king says ,  i knowed it ;  i reckon that 'll convince anybody the way he feels about it .
here ,  mary jane ,  susan ,  joanner ,  take the moneytake it all .
it's the gift of him that lays yonder ,  cold but joyful mary jane she went for him ,  susan and the harelip went for the duke ,  and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet .
and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes ,  and most shook the hands off of them frauds ,  saying all the time :  you dear good soulshow lovelyhow could you well ,  then ,  pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again ,  and how good he was ,  and what a loss he was ,  and all that ;  and before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside ,  and stood alistening and looking ,  and not saying anything ;  and nobody saying anything to him either ,  because the king was talking and they was all busy listening .
the king was sayingin the middle of something he'd started in on they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased .
that's why they're invited here this evenin' ;  but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybody ;  for he respected everybody ,  he liked everybody ,  and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public and so he went amooning on and on ,  liking to hear himself talk ,  and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again ,  till the duke he couldn't stand it no more ;  so he writes on a little scrap of paper ,  obsequies ,  you old fool ,  and folds it up ,  and goes to googooing and reaching it over people's heads to him .
the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket ,  and says :  poor william ,  afflicted as he is ,  his heart's aluz right .
asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make 'em all welcome .
but he needn't a worriedit was jest what i was at then he weaves along again ,  perfectly ca'm ,  and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then ,  just like he done before .
and when he done it the third time he says :  i say orgies ,  not because it's the common term ,  because it ain'tobsequies bein' the common termbut because orgies is the right term .
obsequies ain't used in england no more nowit's gone out .
we say orgies now in england .
orgies is better ,  because it means the thing you're after more exact .
it's a word that's made up out'n the greek orgo ,  outside ,  open ,  abroad ;  and the hebrew jeesum ,  to plant ,  cover up ;  hence inter so ,  you see ,  funeral orgies is an open er public funeral he was the worst i ever struck .
well ,  the ironjawed man he laughed right in his face .
everybody was shocked .
everybody says ,  why ,  doctor and abner shackleford says :  why ,  robinson ,  hain't you heard the news ?
this is harvey wilks the king he smiled eager ,  and shoved out his flapper ,  and says :  is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician ?
i keep your hands off of me says the doctor .
you talk like an englishman ,  don't you ?
it's the worst imitation i ever heard .
you peter wilks's brother !
you're a fraud ,  that's what you are well ,  how they all took on !
they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down ,  and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he was harvey ,  and knowed everybody by name ,  and the names of the very dogs ,  and begged and begged him not to hurt harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings ,  and all that .
but it warn't no use ;  he stormed right along ,  and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar .
the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ;  and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them .
he says :  i was your father's friend ,  and i'm your friend ;  and i warn you as a friend ,  and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble ,  to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him ,  the ignorant tramp ,  with his idiotic greek and hebrew ,  as he calls it .
he is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres ,  and you take them for proofs ,  and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here ,  who ought to know better .
mary jane wilks ,  you know me for your friend ,  and for your unselfish friend ,  too .
now listen to me ;  turn this pitiful rascal outi beg you to do it .
will you mary jane straightened herself up ,  and my ,  but she was handsome !
she says :  here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the king's hands ,  and says ,  take this six thousand dollars ,  and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to ,  and don't give us no receipt for it then she put her arm around the king on one side ,  and susan and the harelip done the same on the other .
everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm ,  whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud .
the doctor says :  all right ;  i wash my hands of the matter .
but i warn you all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day and away he went .
all right ,  doctor ,  says the king ,  kinder mocking him ;  we'll try and get 'em to send for you ;  which made them all laugh ,  and they said it was a prime good hit .
well ,  when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms ,  and she said she had one spare room ,  which would do for uncle william ,  and she'd give her own room to uncle harvey ,  which was a little bigger ,  and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ;  and up garret was a little cubby ,  with a pallet in it .
the king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me .
so mary jane took us up ,  and she showed them their rooms ,  which was plain but nice .
she said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harvey's way ,  but he said they warn't .
the frocks was hung along the wall ,  and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor .
there was an old hair trunk in one corner ,  and a guitarbox in another ,  and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around ,  like girls brisken up a room with .
the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings ,  and so don't disturb them .
the duke's room was pretty small ,  but plenty good enough ,  and so was my cubby .
that night they had a big supper ,  and all them men and women was there ,  and i stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them ,  and the niggers waited on the rest .
mary jane she set at the head of the table ,  with susan alongside of her ,  and said how bad the biscuits was ,  and how mean the preserves was ,  and how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind of rot ,  the way women always do for to force out compliments ;  and the people all knowed everything was tiptop ,  and said sosaid how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where ,  for the land's sake ,  did you get these amaz'n pickles and all that kind of humbug talkytalk ,  just the way people always does at a supper ,  you know .
and when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings ,  whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things .
the harelip she got to pumping me about england ,  and blest if i didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes .
she says :  did you ever see the king who ?
william fourth ?
well ,  i bet i havehe goes to our church i knowed he was dead years ago ,  but i never let on .
so when i says he goes to our church ,  she says :  whatregular yesregular .
his pew's right over opposite ournon t'other side the pulpit i thought he lived in london well ,  he does .
where would he live but i thought you lived in sheffield i see i was up a stump .
i had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone ,  so as to get time to think how to get down again .
then i says :  i mean he goes to our church regular when he's in sheffield .
that's only in the summer time ,  when he comes there to take the sea baths why ,  how you talksheffield ain't on the sea well ,  who said it was why ,  you did i didn't nuther you did i didn't you did i never said nothing of the kind well ,  what did you say ,  then said he come to take the sea bathsthat's what i said well ,  then ,  how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea looky here ,  i says ;  did you ever see any congresswater yes well ,  did you have to go to congress to get it why ,  no well ,  neither does william fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath how does he get it ,  then gets it the way people down here gets congresswaterin barrels .
there in the palace at sheffield they've got furnaces ,  and he wants his water hot .
they can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea .
they haven't got no conveniences for it oh ,  i see ,  now .
you might a said that in the first place and saved time when she said that i see i was out of the woods again ,  and so i was comfortable and glad .
next ,  she says :  do you go to church ,  too yesregular where do you set why ,  in our pew whose pew why ,  ournyour uncle harvey's his'n ?
what does he want with a pew wants it to set in .
what did you reckon he wanted with it why ,  i thought he'd be in the pulpit rot him ,  i forgot he was a preacher .
i see i was up a stump again ,  so i played another chicken bone and got another think .
then i says :  blame it ,  do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church why ,  what do they want with more whatto preach before a king ?
i never did see such a girl as you .
they don't have no less than seventeen seventeen !
my land !
why ,  i wouldn't set out such a string as that ,  not if i never got to glory .
it must take 'em a week shucks ,  they don't all of 'em preach the same dayonly one of 'em well ,  then ,  what does the rest of 'em do oh ,  nothing much .
loll around ,  pass the plateand one thing or another .
but mainly they don't do nothing well ,  then ,  what are they for why ,  they're for style .
don't you know nothing well ,  i don't want to know no such foolishness as that .
how is servants treated in england ?
do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers no !
a servant ain't nobody there .
they treat them worse than dogs don't they give 'em holidays ,  the way we do ,  christmas and new year's week ,  and fourth of july oh ,  just listen !
a body could tell you hain't ever been to england by that .
why ,  harelwhy ,  joanna ,  they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end ;  never go to the circus ,  nor theater ,  nor nigger shows ,  nor nowheres nor church nor church but you always went to church well ,  i was gone up again .
i forgot i was the old man's servant .
but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not ,  and set with the family ,  on account of its being the law .
but i didn't do it pretty good ,  and when i got done i see she warn't satisfied .
she says :  honest injun ,  now ,  hain't you been telling me a lot of lies honest injun ,  says i .
none of it at all none of it at all .
not a lie in it ,  says i .
lay your hand on this book and say it i see it warn't nothing but a dictionary ,  so i laid my hand on it and said it .
so then she looked a little better satisfied ,  and says :  well ,  then ,  i'll believe some of it ;  but i hope to gracious if i'll believe the rest what is it you won't believe ,  joe says mary jane ,  stepping in with susan behind her .
it ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him ,  and him a stranger and so far from his people .
how would you like to be treated so that's always your way ,  maimalways sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt .
i hain't done nothing to him .
he's told some stretchers ,  i reckon ,  and i said i wouldn't swallow it all ;  and that's every bit and grain i did say .
i reckon he can stand a little thing like that ,  can't he i don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big ;  he's here in our house and a stranger ,  and it wasn't good of you to say it .
if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ;  and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed why ,  mam ,  he said it don't make no difference what he saidthat ain't the thing .
the thing is for you to treat him kind ,  and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks i says to myself ,  this is a girl that i'm letting that old reptile rob her of her money !
then susan she waltzed in ;  and if you'll believe me ,  she did give harelip hark from the tomb !
says i to myself ,  and this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money !
then mary jane she took another inning ,  and went in sweet and lovely againwhich was her way ;  but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor harelip .
so she hollered .
all right ,  then ,  says the other girls ;  you just ask his pardon she done it ,  too ;  and she done it beautiful .
she done it so beautiful it was good to hear ;  and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies ,  so she could do it again .
i says to myself ,  this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her money .
and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends .
i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself ,  my mind's made up ;  i'll hive that money for them or bust .
so then i lit outfor bed ,  i said ,  meaning some time or another .
when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over .
i says to myself ,  shall i go to that doctor ,  private ,  and blow on these frauds ?
nothat won't do .
he might tell who told him ;  then the king and the duke would make it warm for me .
shall i go ,  private ,  and tell mary jane ?
noi dasn't do it .
her face would give them a hint ,  sure ;  they've got the money ,  and they'd slide right out and get away with it .
if she was to fetch in help i'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with ,  i judge .
no ;  there ain't no good way but one .
i got to steal that money ,  somehow ;  and i got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that i done it .
they've got a good thing here ,  and they ain't agoing to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth ,  so i'll find a chance time enough .
i'll steal it and hide it ;  and by and by ,  when i'm away down the river ,  i'll write a letter and tell mary jane where it's hid .
but i better hive it tonight if i can ,  because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has ;  he might scare them out of here yet .
so ,  thinks i ,  i'll go and search them rooms .
upstairs the hall was dark ,  but i found the duke's room ,  and started to paw around it with my hands ;  but i recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ;  so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there .
but i see i couldn't do nothing without a candle ,  and i dasn't light one ,  of course .
so i judged i'd got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop .
about that time i hears their footsteps coming ,  and was going to skip under the bed ;  i reached for it ,  but it wasn't where i thought it would be ;  but i touched the curtain that hid mary jane's frocks ,  so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns ,  and stood there perfectly still .
they come in and shut the door ;  and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed .
then i was glad i hadn't found the bed when i wanted it .
and yet ,  you know ,  it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private .
they sets down then ,  and the king says :  well ,  what is it ?
and cut it middlin' short ,  because it's better for us to be down there awhoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over well ,  this is it ,  capet .
i ain't easy ;  i ain't comfortable .
that doctor lays on my mind .
i wanted to know your plans .
i've got a notion ,  and i think it's a sound one what is it ,  duke that we better glide out of this before three in the morning ,  and clip it down the river with what we've got .
specially ,  seeing we got it so easygiven back to us ,  flung at our heads ,  as you may say ,  when of course we allowed to have to steal it back .
i'm for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad .
about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different ,  but now it made me feel bad and disappointed ,  the king rips out and says :  what !
and not sell out the rest o' the property ?
march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped inand all good ,  salable stuff ,  too the duke he grumbled ;  said the bag of gold was enough ,  and he didn't want to go no deeperdidn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had .
why ,  how you talk says the king .
we sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money .
the people that buys the property is the suff'rers ;  because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own itwhich won't be long after we've slidthe sale won't be valid ,  and it 'll all go back to the estate .
these yer orphans 'll git their house back agin ,  and that's enough for them ;  they're young and spry ,  and k'n easy earn a livin' .
they ain't agoin to suffer .
why ,  jest thinkthere's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off .
bless you ,  they ain't got noth'n' to complain of well ,  the king he talked him blind ;  so at last he give in ,  and said all right ,  but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay ,  and that doctor hanging over them .
but the king says :  cuss the doctor !
what do we k'yer for him ?
hain't we got all the fools in town on our side ?
and ain't that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again .
the duke says :  i don't think we put that money in a good place that cheered me up .
i'd begun to think i warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me .
the king says :  why because mary jane 'll be in mourning from this out ;  and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away ;  and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your head's level agin ,  duke ,  says the king ;  and he comes afumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was .
i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still ,  though quivery ;  and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me ;  and i tried to think what i'd better do if they did catch me .
but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought ,  and he never suspicioned i was around .
they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed ,  and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now ,  because a nigger only makes up the featherbed ,  and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year ,  and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now .
but i knowed better .
i had it out of there before they was halfway down stairs .
i groped along up to my cubby ,  and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better .
i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres ,  because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking :  i knowed that very well .
then i turned in ,  with my clothes all on ;  but i couldn't a gone to sleep if i'd a wanted to ,  i was in such a sweat to get through with the business .
by and by i heard the king and the duke come up ;  so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder ,  and waited to see if anything was going to happen .
but nothing did .
so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet ;  and then i slipped down the ladder .
i crept to their doors and listened ;  they was snoring .
so i tiptoed along ,  and got down stairs all right .
there warn't a sound anywheres .
i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door ,  and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs .
the door was open into the parlor ,  where the corpse was laying ,  and there was a candle in both rooms .
i passed along ,  and the parlor door was open ;  but i see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of peter ;  so i shoved on by ;  but the front door was locked ,  and the key wasn't there .
just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs ,  back behind me .
i run in the parlor and took a swift look around ,  and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin .
the lid was shoved along about a foot ,  showing the dead man's face down in there ,  with a wet cloth over it ,  and his shroud on .
i tucked the moneybag in under the lid ,  just down beyond where his hands was crossed ,  which made me creep ,  they was so cold ,  and then i run back across the room and in behind the door .
the person coming was mary jane .
she went to the coffin ,  very soft ,  and kneeled down and looked in ;  then she put up her handkerchief ,  and i see she begun to cry ,  though i couldn't hear her ,  and her back was to me .
i slid out ,  and as i passed the diningroom i thought i'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me ;  so i looked through the crack ,  and everything was all right .
they hadn't stirred .
i slipped up to bed ,  feeling ruther blue ,  on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it .
says i ,  if it could stay where it is ,  all right ;  because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane ,  and she could dig him up again and get it ;  but that ain't the thing that's going to happen ;  the thing that's going to happen is ,  the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid .
then the king 'll get it again ,  and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him .
of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there ,  but i dasn't try it .
every minute it was getting earlier now ,  and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir ,  and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of .
i don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that ,  i says to myself .
when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up ,  and the watchers was gone .
there warn't nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe .
i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening ,  but i couldn't tell .
towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man ,  and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs ,  and then set all our chairs in rows ,  and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full .
i see the coffin lid was the way it was before ,  but i dasn't go to look in under it ,  with folks around .
then the people begun to flock in ,  and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin ,  and for a half an hour the people filed around slow ,  in single rank ,  and looked down at the dead man's face a minute ,  and some dropped in a tear ,  and it was all very still and solemn ,  only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent ,  and sobbing a little .
there warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church .
when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways ,  putting on the last touches ,  and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable ,  and making no more sound than a cat .
he never spoke ;  he moved people around ,  he squeezed in late ones ,  he opened up passageways ,  and done it with nods ,  and signs with his hands .
then he took his place over against the wall .
he was the softest ,  glidingest ,  stealthiest man i ever see ;  and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham .
they had borrowed a melodeuma sick one ;  and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it ,  and it was pretty skreeky and colicky ,  and everybody joined in and sung ,  and peter was the only one that had a good thing ,  according to my notion .
then the reverend hobson opened up ,  slow and solemn ,  and begun to talk ;  and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ;  it was only one dog ,  but he made a most powerful racket ,  and he kept it up right along ;  the parson he had to stand there ,  over the coffin ,  and waityou couldn't hear yourself think .
it was right down awkward ,  and nobody didn't seem to know what to do .
but pretty soon they see that longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say ,  don't you worryjust depend on me then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall ,  just his shoulders showing over the people's heads .
so he glided along ,  and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ;  and at last ,  when he had gone around two sides of the room ,  he disappears down cellar .
then in about two seconds we heard a whack ,  and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two ,  and then everything was dead still ,  and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off .
in a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ;  and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room ,  and then rose up ,  and shaded his mouth with his hands ,  and stretched his neck out towards the preacher ,  over the people's heads ,  and says ,  in a kind of a coarse whisper ,  he had a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place .
you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people ,  because naturally they wanted to know .
a little thing like that don't cost nothing ,  and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked .
there warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was .
well ,  the funeral sermon was very good ,  but pison long and tiresome ;  and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage ,  and at last the job was through ,  and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver .
i was in a sweat then ,  and watched him pretty keen .
but he never meddled at all ;  just slid the lid along as soft as mush ,  and screwed it down tight and fast .
so there i was !
i didn't know whether the money was in there or not .
so ,  says i ,  s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mary jane or not ?
s'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing ,  what would she think of me ?
blame it ,  i says ,  i might get hunted up and jailed ;  i'd better lay low and keep dark ,  and not write at all ;  the thing's awful mixed now ;  trying to better it ,  i've worsened it a hundred times ,  and i wish to goodness i'd just let it alone ,  dad fetch the whole business !
they buried him ,  and we come back home ,  and i went to watching faces againi couldn't help it ,  and i couldn't rest easy .
but nothing come of it ;  the faces didn't tell me nothing .
the king he visited around in the evening ,  and sweetened everybody up ,  and made himself ever so friendly ;  and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him ,  so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home .
he was very sorry he was so pushed ,  and so was everybody ;  they wished he could stay longer ,  but they said they could see it couldn't be done .
and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them ;  and that pleased everybody too ,  because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations ;  and it pleased the girls ,  tootickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world ;  and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to ,  they would be ready .
them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so ,  but i didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune .
well ,  blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral ;  but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to .
so the next day after the funeral ,  along about noontime ,  the girls' joy got the first jolt .
a couple of nigger traders come along ,  and the king sold them the niggers reasonable ,  for threeday drafts as they called it ,  and away they went ,  the two sons up the river to memphis ,  and their mother down the river to orleans .
i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ;  they cried around each other ,  and took on so it most made me down sick to see it .
the girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town .
i can't ever get it out of my memory ,  the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying ;  and i reckon i couldn't a stood it all ,  but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two .
the thing made a big stir in the town ,  too ,  and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way .
it injured the frauds some ;  but the old fool he bulled right along ,  spite of all the duke could say or do ,  and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy .
next day was auction day .
about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up ,  and i see by their look that there was trouble .
the king says :  was you in my room night before last no ,  your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warn't around .
was you in there yisterday er last night no ,  your majesty honor bright ,  nowno lies honor bright ,  your majesty ,  i'm telling you the truth .
i hain't been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you the duke says :  have you seen anybody else go in there no ,  your grace ,  not as i remember ,  i believe stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance ;  then i says :  well ,  i see the niggers go in there several times both of them gave a little jump ,  and looked like they hadn't ever expected it ,  and then like they had .
then the duke says :  what ,  all of them noleastways ,  not all at oncethat is ,  i don't think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time hello !
when was that it was the day we had the funeral .
in the morning .
it warn't early ,  because i overslept .
i was just starting down the ladder ,  and i see them well ,  go on ,  go on !
what did they do ?
how'd they act they didn't do nothing .
and they didn't act anyway much ,  as fur as i see .
they tiptoed away ;  so i seen ,  easy enough ,  that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room ,  or something ,  s'posing you was up ;  and found you warn't up ,  and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up ,  if they hadn't already waked you up great guns ,  this is a go says the king ;  and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly .
they stood there athinking and scratching their heads a minute ,  and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle ,  and says :  it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand .
they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region !
and i believed they was sorry ,  and so did you ,  and so did everybody .
don't ever tell me any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent .
why ,  the way they played that thing it would fool anybody .
in my opinion ,  there's a fortune in 'em .
if i had capital and a theater ,  i wouldn't want a better layout than thatand here we've gone and sold 'em for a song .
yes ,  and ain't privileged to sing the song yet .
say ,  where is that songthat draft in the bank for to be collected .
where would it be well ,  that's all right then ,  thank goodness says i ,  kind of timidlike :  is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out :  none o' your business !
you keep your head shet ,  and mind y'r own affairsif you got any .
long as you're in this town don't you forgit thatyou hear then he says to the duke ,  we got to jest swaller it and say noth'n' :  mum's the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again ,  and says :  quick sales and small profits !
it's a good businessyes the king snarls around on him and says :  i was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick .
if the profits has turned out to be none ,  lackin' considable ,  and none to carry ,  is it my fault any more'n it's yourn well ,  they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if i could a got my advice listened to the king sassed back as much as was safe for him ,  and then swapped around and lit into me again .
he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up .
and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile ,  and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning ,  and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again .
so they went off ajawing ;  and i felt dreadful glad i'd worked it all off on to the niggers ,  and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it .
by and by it was gettingup time .
so i come down the ladder and started for downstairs ;  but as i come to the girls' room the door was open ,  and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk ,  which was open and she'd been packing things in itgetting ready to go to england .
but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap ,  and had her face in her hands ,  crying .
i felt awful bad to see it ;  of course anybody would .
i went in there and says :  miss mary jane ,  you can't abear to see people in trouble ,  and i can'tmost always .
tell me about it so she done it .
and it was the niggersi just expected it .
she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her ;  she didn't know how she was ever going to be happy there ,  knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever ,  and flung up her hands ,  and says :  oh ,  dear ,  dear ,  to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more but they willand inside of two weeksand i know it says i .
laws ,  it was out before i could think !
and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again ,  say it again ,  say it again !
i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much ,  and was in a close place .
i asked her to let me think a minute ;  and she set there ,  very impatient and excited and handsome ,  but looking kind of happy and easedup ,  like a person that's had a tooth pulled out .
so i went to studying it out .
i says to myself ,  i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks ,  though i ain't had no experience ,  and can't say for certain ;  but it looks so to me ,  anyway ;  and yet here's a case where i'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie .
i must lay it by in my mind ,  and think it over some time or other ,  it's so kind of strange and unregular .
i never see nothing like it .
well ,  i says to myself at last ,  i'm agoing to chance it ;  i'll up and tell the truth this time ,  though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to .
then i says :  miss mary jane ,  is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days yes ;  mr. lothrop's .
why never mind why yet .
if i'll tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand prove how i know itwill you go to mr. lothrop's and stay four days four days she says ;  i'll stay a year all right ,  i says ,  i don't want nothing more out of you than just your wordi druther have it than another man's kissthebible she smiled and reddened up very sweet ,  and i says ,  if you don't mind it ,  i'll shut the doorand bolt it then i come back and set down again ,  and says :  don't you holler .
just set still and take it like a man .
i got to tell the truth ,  and you want to brace up ,  miss mary ,  because it's a bad kind ,  and going to be hard to take ,  but there ain't no help for it .
these uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all ;  they're a couple of fraudsregular deadbeats .
there ,  now we're over the worst of it ,  you can stand the rest middling easy it jolted her up like everything ,  of course ;  but i was over the shoal water now ,  so i went right along ,  her eyes ablazing higher and higher all the time ,  and told her every blame thing ,  from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat ,  clear through to where she flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps ,  with her face afire like sunset ,  and says :  the brute !
come ,  don't waste a minutenot a secondwe'll have them tarred and feathered ,  and flung in the river says i :  cert'nly .
but do you mean before you go to mr. lothrop's ,  or oh ,  she says ,  what am i thinking about she says ,  and set right down again .
don't mind what i saidplease don'tyou won't ,  now ,  will you laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first .
i never thought ,  i was so stirred up ,  she says ;  now go on ,  and i won't do so any more .
you tell me what to do ,  and whatever you say i'll do it well ,  i says ,  it's a rough gang ,  them two frauds ,  and i'm fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer ,  whether i want to or noti druther not tell you why ;  and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws ,  and i'd be all right ;  but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble .
well ,  we got to save him ,  hain't we ?
of course .
well ,  then ,  we won't blow on them saying them words put a good idea in my head .
i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds ;  get them jailed here ,  and then leave .
but i didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ;  so i didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight .
i says :  miss mary jane ,  i'll tell you what we'll do ,  and you won't have to stay at mr. lothrop's so long ,  nuther .
how fur is it a little short of four milesright out in the country ,  back here well ,  that 'll answer .
now you go along out there ,  and lay low till nine or halfpast tonight ,  and then get them to fetch you home againtell them you've thought of something .
if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window ,  and if i don't turn up wait till eleven ,  and then if i don't turn up it means i'm gone ,  and out of the way ,  and safe .
then you come out and spread the news around ,  and get these beats jailed good ,  she says ,  i'll do it and if it just happens so that i don't get away ,  but get took up along with them ,  you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand ,  and you must stand by me all you can stand by you !
indeed i will .
they sha'n't touch a hair of your head she says ,  and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it ,  too .
if i get away i sha'n't be here ,  i says ,  to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles ,  and i couldn't do it if i was here .
i could swear they was beats and bummers ,  that's all ,  though that's worth something .
well ,  there's others can do that better than what i can ,  and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as i'd be .
i'll tell you how to find them .
gimme a pencil and a piece of paper .
there'royal nonesuch ,  bricksville' put it away ,  and don't lose it .
when the court wants to find out something about these two ,  let them send up to bricksville and say they've got the men that played the royal nonesuch ,  and ask for some witnesseswhy ,  you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink ,  miss mary .
and they'll come abiling ,  too i judged we had got everything fixed about right now .
so i says :  just let the auction go right along ,  and don't worry .
nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice ,  and they ain't going out of this till they get that money ;  and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count ,  and they ain't going to get no money .
it's just like the way it was with the niggersit warn't no sale ,  and the niggers will be back before long .
why ,  they can't collect the money for the niggers yetthey're in the worst kind of a fix ,  miss mary well ,  she says ,  i'll run down to breakfast now ,  and then i'll start straight for mr. lothrop's 'deed ,  that ain't the ticket ,  miss mary jane ,  i says ,  by no manner of means ;  go before breakfast why what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for ,  miss mary well ,  i never thoughtand come to think ,  i don't know .
what was it why ,  it's because you ain't one of these leatherface people .
i don't want no better book than what your face is .
a body can set down and read it off like coarse print .
do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you goodmorning ,  and never there ,  there ,  don't !
yes ,  i'll go before breakfasti'll be glad to .
and leave my sisters with them yes ;  never mind about them .
they've got to stand it yet a while .
they might suspicion something if all of you was to go .
i don't want you to see them ,  nor your sisters ,  nor nobody in this town ;  if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something .
no ,  you go right along ,  miss mary jane ,  and i'll fix it with all of them .
i'll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change ,  or to see a friend ,  and you'll be back tonight or early in the morning gone to see a friend is all right ,  but i won't have my love given to them well ,  then ,  it sha'n't be it was well enough to tell her sono harm in it .
it was only a little thing to do ,  and no trouble ;  and it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most ,  down here below ;  it would make mary jane comfortable ,  and it wouldn't cost nothing .
then i says :  there's one more thingthat bag of money well ,  they've got that ;  and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it no ,  you're out ,  there .
they hain't got it why ,  who's got it i wish i knowed ,  but i don't .
i had it ,  because i stole it from them ;  and i stole it to give to you ;  and i know where i hid it ,  but i'm afraid it ain't there no more .
i'm awful sorry ,  miss mary jane ,  i'm just as sorry as i can be ;  but i done the best i could ;  i did honest .
i come nigh getting caught ,  and i had to shove it into the first place i come to ,  and runand it warn't a good place oh ,  stop blaming yourselfit's too bad to do it ,  and i won't allow ityou couldn't help it ;  it wasn't your fault .
where did you hide it i didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ;  and i couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach .
so for a minute i didn't say nothing ;  then i says :  i'd ruther not tell you where i put it ,  miss mary jane ,  if you don't mind letting me off ;  but i'll write it for you on a piece of paper ,  and you can read it along the road to mr. lothrop's ,  if you want to .
do you reckon that 'll do oh ,  yes so i wrote :  i put it in the coffin .
it was in there when you was crying there ,  away in the night .
i was behind the door ,  and i was mighty sorry for you ,  miss mary jane it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night ,  and them devils laying there right under her own roof ,  shaming her and robbing her ;  and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes ,  too ;  and she shook me by the hand ,  hard ,  and says :  goodbye .
i'm going to do everything just as you've told me ;  and if i don't ever see you again ,  i sha'n't ever forget you and i'll think of you a many and a many a time ,  and i'll pray for you ,  tooand she was gone .
pray for me !
i reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size .
but i bet she done it ,  just the sameshe was just that kind .
she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notionthere warn't no backdown to her ,  i judge .
you may say what you want to ,  but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see ;  in my opinion she was just full of sand .
it sounds like flattery ,  but it ain't no flattery .
and when it comes to beautyand goodness ,  tooshe lays over them all .
i hain't ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door ;  no ,  i hain't ever seen her since ,  but i reckon i've thought of her a many and a many a million times ,  and of her saying she would pray for me ;  and if ever i'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her ,  blamed if i wouldn't a done it or bust .
well ,  mary jane she lit out the back way ,  i reckon ;  because nobody see her go .
when i struck susan and the harelip ,  i says :  what's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes they says :  there's several ;  but it's the proctors ,  mainly that's the name ,  i says ;  i most forgot it .
well ,  miss mary jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of them's sick which one i don't know ;  leastways ,  i kinder forget ;  but i thinks it's sakes alive ,  i hope it ain't hanner i'm sorry to say it ,  i says ,  but hanner's the very one my goodness ,  and she so well only last week !
is she took bad it ain't no name for it .
they set up with her all night ,  miss mary jane said ,  and they don't think she'll last many hours only think of that ,  now !
what's the matter with her i couldn't think of anything reasonable ,  right off that way ,  so i says :  mumps mumps your granny !
they don't set up with people that's got the mumps they don't ,  don't they ?
you better bet they do with these mumps .
these mumps is different .
it's a new kind ,  miss mary jane said how's it a new kind because it's mixed up with other things what other things well ,  measles ,  and whoopingcough ,  and erysiplas ,  and consumption ,  and yaller janders ,  and brainfever ,  and i don't know what all my land !
and they call it the mumps that's what miss mary jane said well ,  what in the nation do they call it the mumps for why ,  because it is the mumps .
that's what it starts with well ,  ther' ain't no sense in it .
a body might stump his toe ,  and take pison ,  and fall down the well ,  and break his neck ,  and bust his brains out ,  and somebody come along and ask what killed him ,  and some numskull up and say ,  'why ,  he stumped his toe' would ther' be any sense in that ?
no .
and ther' ain't no sense in this ,  nuther .
is it ketching is it ketching ?
why ,  how you talk .
is a harrow catchingin the dark ?
if you don't hitch on to one tooth ,  you're bound to on another ,  ain't you ?
and you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along ,  can you ?
well ,  these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow ,  as you may sayand it ain't no slouch of a harrow ,  nuther ,  you come to get it hitched on good well ,  it's awful ,  i think ,  says the harelip .
i'll go to uncle harvey and oh ,  yes ,  i says ,  i would .
of course i would .
i wouldn't lose no time well ,  why wouldn't you just look at it a minute ,  and maybe you can see .
hain't your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can ?
and do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves ?
you know they'll wait for you .
so fur ,  so good .
your uncle harvey's a preacher ,  ain't he ?
very well ,  then ;  is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk ?
is he going to deceive a ship clerkso as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard ?
now you know he ain't .
what will he do ,  then ?
why ,  he'll say ,  'it's a great pity ,  but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ;  for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps ,  and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it' but never mind ,  if you think it's best to tell your uncle harvey shucks ,  and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary jane's got it or not ?
why ,  you talk like a muggins well ,  anyway ,  maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors listen at that ,  now .
you do beat all for natural stupidness .
can't you see that they'd go and tell ?
ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at all well ,  maybe you're rightyes ,  i judge you are right but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey she's gone out a while ,  anyway ,  so he won't be uneasy about her yes ,  miss mary jane she wanted you to do that .
she says ,  'tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss ,  and say i've run over the river to see mr'mrwhat is the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much ofi mean the one that why ,  you must mean the apthorps ,  ain't it of course ;  bother them kind of names ,  a body can't ever seem to remember them ,  half the time ,  somehow .
yes ,  she said ,  say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house ,  because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else ;  and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come ,  and then ,  if she ain't too tired ,  she's coming home ;  and if she is ,  she'll be home in the morning anyway .
she said ,  don't say nothing about the proctors ,  but only about the apthorpswhich 'll be perfectly true ,  because she is going there to speak about their buying the house ;  i know it ,  because she told me so herself all right ,  they said ,  and cleared out to lay for their uncles ,  and give them the love and the kisses ,  and tell them the message .
everything was all right now .
the girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to england ;  and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson .
i felt very good ;  i judged i had done it pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself .
of course he would a throwed more style into it ,  but i can't do that very handy ,  not being brung up to it .
well ,  they held the auction in the public square ,  along towards the end of the afternoon ,  and it strung along ,  and strung along ,  and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest ,  up there longside of the auctioneer ,  and chipping in a little scripture now and then ,  or a little goodygoody saying of some kind ,  and the duke he was around googooing for sympathy all he knowed how ,  and just spreading himself generly .
but by and by the thing dragged through ,  and everything was soldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
so they'd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything .
well ,  whilst they was at it a steamboat landed ,  and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on ,  and singing out :  here's your opposition line !
here's your two sets o' heirs to old peter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice they was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along ,  and a nicelooking younger one ,  with his right arm in a sling .
and ,  my souls ,  how the people yelled and laughed ,  and kept it up .
but i didn't see no joke about it ,  and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any .
i reckoned they'd turn pale .
but no ,  nary a pale did they turn .
the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up ,  but just went a googooing around ,  happy and satisfied ,  like a jug that's googling out buttermilk ;  and as for the king ,  he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world .
oh ,  he done it admirable .
lots of the principal people gethered around the king ,  to let him see they was on his side .
that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death .
pretty soon he begun to speak ,  and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishmannot the king's way ,  though the king's was pretty good for an imitation .
i can't give the old gent's words ,  nor i can't imitate him ;  but he turned around to the crowd ,  and says ,  about like this :  this is a surprise to me which i wasn't looking for ;  and i'll acknowledge ,  candid and frank ,  i ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ;  for my brother and me has had misfortunes ;  he's broke his arm ,  and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake .
i am peter wilks' brother harvey ,  and this is his brother william ,  which can't hear nor speakand can't even make signs to amount to much ,  now't he's only got one hand to work them with .
we are who we say we are ;  and in a day or two ,  when i get the baggage ,  i can prove it .
but up till then i won't say nothing more ,  but go to the hotel and wait so him and the new dummy started off ;  and the king he laughs ,  and blethers out :  broke his armvery likely ,  ain't itand very convenient ,  too ,  for a fraud that's got to make signs ,  and ain't learnt how .
lost their baggage !
that's mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder the circumstances so he laughed again ;  and so did everybody else ,  except three or four ,  or maybe half a dozen .
one of these was that doctor ;  another one was a sharplooking gentleman ,  with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpetstuff ,  that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice ,  and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their headsit was levi bell ,  the lawyer that was gone up to louisville ;  and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said ,  and was listening to the king now .
and when the king got done this husky up and says :  say ,  looky here ;  if you are harvey wilks ,  when'd you come to this town the day before the funeral ,  friend ,  says the king .
but what time o' day in the evenin''bout an hour er two before sundown how'd you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well ,  then ,  how'd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin'in a canoe i warn't up at the pint in the mornin' it's a lie several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher .
preacher be hanged ,  he's a fraud and a liar .
he was up at the pint that mornin' .
i live up there ,  don't i ?
well ,  i was up there ,  and he was up there .
i see him there .
he come in a canoe ,  along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says :  would you know the boy again if you was to see him ,  hines i reckon i would ,  but i don't know .
why ,  yonder he is ,  now .
i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at .
the doctor says :  neighbors ,  i don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not ;  but if these two ain't frauds ,  i am an idiot ,  that's all .
i think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing .
come along ,  hines ;  come along ,  the rest of you .
we'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple ,  and i reckon we'll find out something before we get through it was nuts for the crowd ,  though maybe not for the king's friends ;  so we all started .
it was about sundown .
the doctor he led me along by the hand ,  and was plenty kind enough ,  but he never let go my hand .
we all got in a big room in the hotel ,  and lit up some candles ,  and fetched in the new couple .
first ,  the doctor says :  i don't wish to be too hard on these two men ,  but i think they're frauds ,  and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about .
if they have ,  won't the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left ?
it ain't unlikely .
if these men ain't frauds ,  they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all rightain't that so everybody agreed to that .
so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart .
but the king he only looked sorrowful ,  and says :  gentlemen ,  i wish the money was there ,  for i ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair ,  open ,  outandout investigation o' this misable business ;  but ,  alas ,  the money ain't there ;  you k'n send and see ,  if you want to where is it ,  then well ,  when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed ,  not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here ,  and considerin' the bed a safe place ,  we not bein' used to niggers ,  and suppos'n' 'em honest ,  like servants in england .
the niggers stole it the very next mornin' after i had went down stairs ;  and when i sold 'em i hadn't missed the money yit ,  so they got clean away with it .
my servant here k'n tell you 'bout it ,  gentlemen the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didn't altogether believe him .
one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it .
i said no ,  but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away ,  and i never thought nothing ,  only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them .
that was all they asked me .
then the doctor whirls on me and says :  are you english ,  too i says yes ;  and him and some others laughed ,  and said ,  stuff well ,  then they sailed in on the general investigation ,  and there we had it ,  up and down ,  hour in ,  hour out ,  and nobody never said a word about supper ,  nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up ,  and kept it up ;  and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see .
they made the king tell his yarn ,  and they made the old gentleman tell his'n ;  and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies .
and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed .
the king he give me a lefthanded look out of the corner of his eye ,  and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side .
i begun to tell about sheffield ,  and how we lived there ,  and all about the english wilkses ,  and so on ;  but i didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ;  and levi bell ,  the lawyer ,  says :  set down ,  my boy ;  i wouldn't strain myself if i was you .
i reckon you ain't used to lying ,  it don't seem to come handy ;  what you want is practice .
you do it pretty awkward i didn't care nothing for the compliment ,  but i was glad to be let off ,  anyway .
the doctor he started to say something ,  and turns and says :  if you'd been in town at first ,  levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand ,  and says :  why ,  is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often about the lawyer and him shook hands ,  and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased ,  and they talked right along awhile ,  and then got to one side and talked low ;  and at last the lawyer speaks up and says :  that 'll fix it .
i'll take the order and send it ,  along with your brother's ,  and then they'll know it's all right so they got some paper and a pen ,  and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side ,  and chawed his tongue ,  and scrawled off something ;  and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the duke looked sick .
but he took the pen and wrote .
so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says :  you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names the old gentleman wrote ,  but nobody couldn't read it .
the lawyer looked powerful astonished ,  and says :  well ,  it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket ,  and examined them ,  and then examined the old man's writing ,  and then them again ;  and then says :  these old letters is from harvey wilks ;  and here's these two handwritings ,  and anybody can see they didn't write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish ,  i tell you ,  to see how the lawyer had took them in ,  and here's this old gentleman's hand writing ,  and anybody can tell ,  easy enough ,  he didn't write themfact is ,  the scratches he makes ain't properly writing at all .
now ,  here's some letters from the new old gentleman says :  if you please ,  let me explain .
nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me .
it's his hand you've got there ,  not mine well says the lawyer ,  this is a state of things .
i've got some of william's letters ,  too ;  so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can com he can't write with his left hand ,  says the old gentleman .
if he could use his right hand ,  you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too .
look at both ,  pleasethey're by the same hand the lawyer done it ,  and says :  i believe it's soand if it ain't so ,  there's a heap stronger resemblance than i'd noticed before ,  anyway .
well ,  well ,  well !
i thought we was right on the track of a solution ,  but it's gone to grass ,  partly .
but anyway ,  one thing is provedthese two ain't either of 'em wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke .
well ,  what do you think ?
that muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then !
indeed he wouldn't .
said it warn't no fair test .
said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world ,  and hadn't tried to writehe see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper .
and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself ;  but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in ,  and says :  i've thought of something .
is there anybody here that helped to lay out my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying yes ,  says somebody ,  me and ab turner done it .
we're both here then the old man turns towards the king ,  and says :  perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick ,  or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under ,  it took him so sudden ;  and ,  mind you ,  it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice ,  because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man ?
he whitened a little ;  he couldn't help it ;  and it was mighty still in there ,  and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him .
says i to myself ,  now he'll throw up the spongethere ain't no more use .
well ,  did he ?
a body can't hardly believe it ,  but he didn't .
i reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out ,  so they'd thin out ,  and him and the duke could break loose and get away .
anyway ,  he set there ,  and pretty soon he begun to smile ,  and says :  mf !
it's a very tough question ,  ain't it !
yes ,  sir ,  i k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast .
it's jest a small ,  thin ,  blue arrowthat's what it is ;  and if you don't look clost ,  you can't see it .
now what do you sayhey well ,  i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout cheek .
the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard ,  and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time ,  and says :  thereyou've heard what he said !
was there any such mark on peter wilks' breast both of them spoke up and says :  we didn't see no such mark good says the old gentleman .
now ,  what you did see on his breast was a small dim p ,  and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young ,  and a w ,  with dashes between them ,  so :  pbwand he marked them that way on a piece of paper .
come ,  ain't that what you saw both of them spoke up again ,  and says :  no ,  we didn't .
we never seen any marks at all well ,  everybody was in a state of mind now ,  and they sings out :  the whole bilin' of 'm 's frauds !
le's duck 'em !
le's drown 'em !
le's ride 'em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once ,  and there was a rattling powwow .
but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells ,  and says :  gentlemengentlemen hear me just a wordjust a single wordif you please !
there's one way yetlet's go and dig up the corpse and look that took them .
hooray they all shouted ,  and was starting right off ;  but the lawyer and the doctor sung out :  hold on ,  hold on !
collar all these four men and the boy ,  and fetch them along ,  too we'll do it they all shouted ;  and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang i was scared ,  now ,  i tell you .
but there warn't no getting away ,  you know .
they gripped us all ,  and marched us right along ,  straight for the graveyard ,  which was a mile and a half down the river ,  and the whole town at our heels ,  for we made noise enough ,  and it was only nine in the evening .
as we went by our house i wished i hadn't sent mary jane out of town ;  because now if i could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me ,  and blow on our deadbeats .
well ,  we swarmed along down the river road ,  just carrying on like wildcats ;  and to make it more scary the sky was darking up ,  and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter ,  and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves .
this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in ;  and i was kinder stunned ;  everything was going so different from what i had allowed for ;  stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to ,  and see all the fun ,  and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come ,  here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks .
if they didn't find them i couldn't bear to think about it ;  and yet ,  somehow ,  i couldn't think about nothing else .
it got darker and darker ,  and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ;  but that big husky had me by the wristhinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip .
he dragged me right along ,  he was so excited ,  and i had to run to keep up .
when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow .
and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted ,  but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern .
but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning ,  and sent a man to the nearest house ,  a half a mile off ,  to borrow one .
so they dug and dug like everything ;  and it got awful dark ,  and the rain started ,  and the wind swished and swushed along ,  and the lightning come brisker and brisker ,  and the thunder boomed ;  but them people never took no notice of it ,  they was so full of this business ;  and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd ,  and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave ,  and the next second the dark wiped it all out ,  and you couldn't see nothing at all .
at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid ,  and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was ,  to scrouge in and get a sight ,  you never see ;  and in the dark ,  that way ,  it was awful .
hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so ,  and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world ,  he was so excited and panting .
all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare ,  and somebody sings out :  by the living jingo ,  here's the bag of gold on his breast hines let out a whoop ,  like everybody else ,  and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look ,  and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell .
i had the road all to myself ,  and i fairly flewleastways ,  i had it all to myself except the solid dark ,  and the nowandthen glares ,  and the buzzing of the rain ,  and the thrashing of the wind ,  and the splitting of the thunder ;  and sure as you are born i did clip it along !
when i struck the town i see there warn't nobody out in the storm ,  so i never hunted for no back streets ,  but humped it straight through the main one ;  and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it .
no light there ;  the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and disappointed ,  i didn't know why .
but at last ,  just as i was sailing by ,  flash comes the light in mary jane's window !
and my heart swelled up sudden ,  like to bust ;  and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark ,  and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world .
she was the best girl i ever see ,  and had the most sand .
the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead ,  i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow ,  and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained i snatched it and shoved .
it was a canoe ,  and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope .
the towhead was a rattling big distance off ,  away out there in the middle of the river ,  but i didn't lose no time ;  and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it .
but i didn't .
as i sprung aboard i sung out :  out with you ,  jim ,  and set her loose !
glory be to goodness ,  we're shut of them jim lit out ,  and was acoming for me with both arms spread ,  he was so full of joy ;  but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards ;  for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded arab all in one ,  and it most scared the livers and lights out of me .
but jim fished me out ,  and was going to hug me and bless me ,  and so on ,  he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke ,  but i says :  not now ;  have it for breakfast ,  have it for breakfast !
cut loose and let her slide so in two seconds away we went asliding down the river ,  and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river ,  and nobody to bother us .
i had to skip around a bit ,  and jump up and crack my heels a few timesi couldn't help it ;  but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well ,  and held my breath and listened and waited ;  and sure enough ,  when the next flash busted out over the water ,  here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum !
it was the king and the duke .
so i wilted right down on to the planks then ,  and give up ;  and it was all i could do to keep from crying .
when they got aboard the king went for me ,  and shook me by the collar ,  and says :  tryin' to give us the slip ,  was ye ,  you pup !
tired of our company ,  hey i says :  no ,  your majesty ,  we warn'tplease don't ,  your majesty quick ,  then ,  and tell us what was your idea ,  or i'll shake the insides out o' you honest ,  i'll tell you everything just as it happened ,  your majesty .
the man that had aholt of me was very good to me ,  and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year ,  and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ;  and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold ,  and made a rush for the coffin ,  he lets go of me and whispers ,  'heel it now ,  or they'll hang ye ,  sure' and i lit out .
it didn't seem no good for me to stayi couldn't do nothing ,  and i didn't want to be hung if i could get away .
so i never stopped running till i found the canoe ;  and when i got here i told jim to hurry ,  or they'd catch me and hang me yet ,  and said i was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now ,  and i was awful sorry ,  and so was jim ,  and was awful glad when we see you coming ;  you may ask jim if i didn't jim said it was so ;  and the king told him to shut up ,  and said ,  oh ,  yes ,  it's mighty likely and shook me up again ,  and said he reckoned he'd drownd me .
but the duke says :  leggo the boy ,  you old idiot !
would you a done any different ?
did you inquire around for him when you got loose ?
i don't remember it so the king let go of me ,  and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it .
but the duke says :  you better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing ,  for you're the one that's entitled to it most .
you hain't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it ,  except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary bluearrow mark .
that was brightit was right down bully ;  and it was the thing that saved us .
for if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailed us till them englishmen's baggage comeand thenthe penitentiary ,  you bet !
but that trick took 'em to the graveyard ,  and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ;  for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to wear ,  toolonger than we'd need 'em they was still a minutethinking ;  then the king says ,  kind of absentminded like :  mf !
and we reckoned the niggers stole it that made me squirm !
yes ,  says the duke ,  kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic ,  we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out :  leastways ,  i did the duke says ,  the same way :  on the contrary ,  i did the king kind of ruffles up ,  and says :  looky here ,  bilgewater ,  what'r you referrin' to the duke says ,  pretty brisk :  when it comes to that ,  maybe you'll let me ask ,  what was you referring to shucks says the king ,  very sarcastic ;  but i don't knowmaybe you was asleep ,  and didn't know what you was about the duke bristles up now ,  and says :  oh ,  let up on this cussed nonsense ;  do you take me for a blame' fool ?
don't you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes ,  sir !
i know you do know ,  because you done it yourself it's a lieand the duke went for him .
the king sings out :  take y'r hands offleggo my throati take it all back the duke says :  well ,  you just own up ,  first ,  that you did hide that money there ,  intending to give me the slip one of these days ,  and come back and dig it up ,  and have it all to yourself wait jest a minute ,  dukeanswer me this one question ,  honest and fair ;  if you didn't put the money there ,  say it ,  and i'll b'lieve you ,  and take back everything i said you old scoundrel ,  i didn't ,  and you know i didn't .
there ,  now well ,  then ,  i b'lieve you .
but answer me only jest this one morenow don't git mad ;  didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it the duke never said nothing for a little bit ;  then he says :  well ,  i don't care if i did ,  i didn't do it ,  anyway .
but you not only had it in mind to do it ,  but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it ,  duke ,  and that's honest .
i won't say i warn't goin' to do it ,  because i was ;  but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o' me it's a lie !
you done it ,  and you got to say you done it ,  or the king began to gurgle ,  and then he gasps out :  'noughi own up i was very glad to hear him say that ;  it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before .
so the duke took his hands off and says :  if you ever deny it again i'll drown you .
it's well for you to set there and blubber like a babyit's fitten for you ,  after the way you've acted .
i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everythingand i atrusting you all the time ,  like you was my own father .
you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers ,  and you never say a word for 'em .
it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage .
cuss you ,  i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted to get what money i'd got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another ,  and scoop it all the king says ,  timid ,  and still asnuffling :  why ,  duke ,  it was you that said make up the deffisit ;  it warn't me dry up !
i don't want to hear no more out of you says the duke .
and now you see what you got by it .
they've got all their own money back ,  and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides .
g'long to bed ,  and don't you deffersit me no more deffersits ,  long 's you live so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort ,  and before long the duke tackled his bottle ;  and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again ,  and the tighter they got the lovinger they got ,  and went off asnoring in each other's arms .
they both got powerful mellow ,  but i noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again .
that made me feel easy and satisfied .
of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble ,  and i told jim everything .
we dasn't stop again at any town for days and days ;  kept right along down the river .
we was down south in the warm weather now ,  and a mighty long ways from home .
we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them ,  hanging down from the limbs like long ,  gray beards .
it was the first i ever see it growing ,  and it made the woods look solemn and dismal .
so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger ,  and they begun to work the villages again .
first they done a lecture on temperance ;  but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on .
then in another village they started a dancingschool ;  but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ;  so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town .
another time they tried to go at yellocution ;  but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing ,  and made them skip out .
they tackled missionarying ,  and mesmerizing ,  and doctoring ,  and telling fortunes ,  and a little of everything ;  but they couldn't seem to have no luck .
so at last they got just about dead broke ,  and laid around the raft as she floated along ,  thinking and thinking ,  and never saying nothing ,  by the half a day at a time ,  and dreadful blue and desperate .
and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time .
jim and me got uneasy .
we didn't like the look of it .
we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever .
we turned it over and over ,  and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store ,  or was going into the counterfeitmoney business ,  or something .
so then we was pretty scared ,  and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions ,  and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind .
well ,  early one morning we hid the raft in a good ,  safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville ,  and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet .
house to rob ,  you mean ,  says i to myself ;  and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raftand you'll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right ,  and we was to come along .
so we stayed where we was .
the duke he fretted and sweated around ,  and was in a mighty sour way .
he scolded us for everything ,  and we couldn't seem to do nothing right ;  he found fault with every little thing .
something was abrewing ,  sure .
i was good and glad when midday come and no king ;  we could have a change ,  anywayand maybe a chance for the change on top of it .
so me and the duke went up to the village ,  and hunted around there for the king ,  and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery ,  very tight ,  and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport ,  and he acussing and athreatening with all his might ,  and so tight he couldn't walk ,  and couldn't do nothing to them .
the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool ,  and the king begun to sass back ,  and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs ,  and spun down the river road like a deer ,  for i see our chance ;  and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again .
i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy ,  and sung out :  set her loose ,  jim !
we're all right now but there warn't no answer ,  and nobody come out of the wigwam .
jim was gone !
i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one ;  and run this way and that in the woods ,  whooping and screeching ;  but it warn't no useold jim was gone .
then i set down and cried ;  i couldn't help it .
but i couldn't set still long .
pretty soon i went out on the road ,  trying to think what i better do ,  and i run across a boy walking ,  and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so ,  and he says :  yes whereabouts says i .
down to silas phelps' place ,  two mile below here .
he's a runaway nigger ,  and they've got him .
was you looking for him you bet i ain't !
i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago ,  and he said if i hollered he'd cut my livers outand told me to lay down and stay where i was ;  and i done it .
been there ever since ;  afeard to come out well ,  he says ,  you needn't be afeard no more ,  becuz they've got him .
he run off f'm down south ,  som'ers it's a good job they got him well ,  i reckon !
there's two hunderd dollars reward on him .
it's like picking up money out'n the road yes ,  it isand i could a had it if i'd been big enough ;  i see him first .
who nailed him it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars ,  becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait .
think o' that ,  now !
you bet i'd wait ,  if it was seven year that's me ,  every time ,  says i .
but maybe his chance ain't worth no more than that ,  if he'll sell it so cheap .
maybe there's something ain't straight about it but it is ,  thoughstraight as a string .
i see the handbill myself .
it tells all about him ,  to a dotpaints him like a picture ,  and tells the plantation he's frum ,  below newrleans .
nosirreebob ,  they ain't no trouble 'bout that speculation ,  you bet you .
say ,  gimme a chaw tobacker ,  won't ye i didn't have none ,  so he left .
i went to the raft ,  and set down in the wigwam to think .
but i couldn't come to nothing .
i thought till i wore my head sore ,  but i couldn't see no way out of the trouble .
after all this long journey ,  and after all we'd done for them scoundrels ,  here it was all come to nothing ,  everything all busted up and ruined ,  because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that ,  and make him a slave again all his life ,  and amongst strangers ,  too ,  for forty dirty dollars .
once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was ,  as long as he'd got to be a slave ,  and so i'd better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was .
but i soon give up that notion for two things :  she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her ,  and so she'd sell him straight down the river again ;  and if she didn't ,  everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger ,  and they'd make jim feel it all the time ,  and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced .
and then think of me !
it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ;  and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again i'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame .
that's just the way :  a person does a lowdown thing ,  and then he don't want to take no consequences of it .
thinks as long as he can hide it ,  it ain't no disgrace .
that was my fix exactly .
the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me ,  and the more wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling .
and at last ,  when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven ,  whilst i was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm ,  and now was showing me there's one that's always on the lookout ,  and ain't agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further ,  i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared .
well ,  i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked ,  and so i warn't so much to blame ;  but something inside of me kept saying ,  there was the sundayschool ,  you could a gone to it ;  and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as i'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire it made me shiver .
and i about made up my mind to pray ,  and see if i couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better .
so i kneeled down .
but the words wouldn't come .
why wouldn't they ?
it warn't no use to try and hide it from him .
nor from me ,  neither .
i knowed very well why they wouldn't come .
it was because my heart warn't right ;  it was because i warn't square ;  it was because i was playing double .
i was letting on to give up sin ,  but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all .
i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing ,  and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was ;  but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie ,  and he knowed it .
you can't pray a liei found that out .
so i was full of trouble ,  full as i could be ;  and didn't know what to do .
at last i had an idea ;  and i says ,  i'll go and write the letterand then see if i can pray .
why ,  it was astonishing ,  the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off ,  and my troubles all gone .
so i got a piece of paper and a pencil ,  all glad and excited ,  and set down and wrote :  miss watson ,  your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville ,  and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send .
huck finn i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life ,  and i knowed i could pray now .
but i didn't do it straight off ,  but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking how good it was all this happened so ,  and how near i come to being lost and going to hell .
and went on thinking .
and got to thinking over our trip down the river ;  and i see jim before me all the time :  in the day and in the nighttime ,  sometimes moonlight ,  sometimes storms ,  and we afloating along ,  talking and singing and laughing .
but somehow i couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him ,  but only the other kind .
i'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n ,  'stead of calling me ,  so i could go on sleeping ;  and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog ;  and when i come to him again in the swamp ,  up there where the feud was ;  and suchlike times ;  and would always call me honey ,  and pet me and do everything he could think of for me ,  and how good he always was ;  and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard ,  and he was so grateful ,  and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world ,  and the only one he's got now ;  and then i happened to look around and see that paper .
it was a close place .
i took it up ,  and held it in my hand .
i was atrembling ,  because i'd got to decide ,  forever ,  betwixt two things ,  and i knowed it .
i studied a minute ,  sort of holding my breath ,  and then says to myself :  all right ,  then ,  i'll go to helland tore it up .
it was awful thoughts and awful words ,  but they was said .
and i let them stay said ;  and never thought no more about reforming .
i shoved the whole thing out of my head ,  and said i would take up wickedness again ,  which was in my line ,  being brung up to it ,  and the other warn't .
and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again ;  and if i could think up anything worse ,  i would do that ,  too ;  because as long as i was in ,  and in for good ,  i might as well go the whole hog .
then i set to thinking over how to get at it ,  and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind ;  and at last fixed up a plan that suited me .
so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece ,  and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it ,  and hid it there ,  and then turned in .
i slept the night through ,  and got up before it was light ,  and had my breakfast ,  and put on my store clothes ,  and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle ,  and took the canoe and cleared for shore .
i landed below where i judged was phelps's place ,  and hid my bundle in the woods ,  and then filled up the canoe with water ,  and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her ,  about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank .
then i struck up the road ,  and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it ,  phelps's sawmill ,  and when i come to the farmhouses ,  two or three hundred yards further along ,  i kept my eyes peeled ,  but didn't see nobody around ,  though it was good daylight now .
but i didn't mind ,  because i didn't want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get the lay of the land .
according to my plan ,  i was going to turn up there from the village ,  not from below .
so i just took a look ,  and shoved along ,  straight for town .
well ,  the very first man i see when i got there was the duke .
he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike that other time .
they had the cheek ,  them frauds !
i was right on him before i could shirk .
he looked astonished ,  and says :  hello !
where'd you come from then he says ,  kind of glad and eager ,  where's the raftgot her in a good place i says :  why ,  that's just what i was going to ask your grace then he didn't look so joyful ,  and says :  what was your idea for asking me he says .
well ,  i says ,  when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself ,  we can't get him home for hours ,  till he's soberer ;  so i went aloafing around town to put in the time and wait .
a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep ,  and so i went along ;  but when we was dragging him to the boat ,  and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along ,  he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run ,  and we after him .
we didn't have no dog ,  and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out .
we never got him till dark ;  then we fetched him over ,  and i started down for the raft .
when i got there and see it was gone ,  i says to myself ,  'they've got into trouble and had to leave ;  and they've took my nigger ,  which is the only nigger i've got in the world ,  and now i'm in a strange country ,  and ain't got no property no more ,  nor nothing ,  and no way to make my living ; ' so i set down and cried .
i slept in the woods all night .
but what did become of the raft ,  thenand jimpoor jim blamed if i knowthat is ,  what's become of the raft .
that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars ,  and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky ;  and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone ,  we said ,  'that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us ,  and run off down the river' i wouldn't shake my nigger ,  would ithe only nigger i had in the world ,  and the only property we never thought of that .
fact is ,  i reckon we'd come to consider him our nigger ;  yes ,  we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for him .
so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke ,  there warn't anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake .
and i've pegged along ever since ,  dry as a powderhorn .
where's that ten cents ?
give it here i had considerable money ,  so i give him ten cents ,  but begged him to spend it for something to eat ,  and give me some ,  because it was all the money i had ,  and i hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday .
he never said nothing .
the next minute he whirls on me and says :  do you reckon that nigger would blow on us ?
we'd skin him if he done that how can he blow ?
hain't he run off no !
that old fool sold him ,  and never divided with me ,  and the money's gone sold him i says ,  and begun to cry ;  why ,  he was my nigger ,  and that was my money .
where is hei want my nigger well ,  you can't get your nigger ,  that's allso dry up your blubbering .
looky heredo you think you'd venture to blow on us ?
blamed if i think i'd trust you .
why ,  if you was to blow on us he stopped ,  but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
i went on awhimpering ,  and says :  i don't want to blow on nobody ;  and i ain't got no time to blow ,  nohow .
i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered ,  and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm ,  thinking ,  and wrinkling up his forehead .
at last he says :  i'll tell you something .
we got to be here three days .
if you'll promise you won't blow ,  and won't let the nigger blow ,  i'll tell you where to find him so i promised ,  and he says :  a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped .
you see ,  he started to tell me the truth ;  but when he stopped that way ,  and begun to study and think again ,  i reckoned he was changing his mind .
and so he was .
he wouldn't trust me ;  he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days .
so pretty soon he says :  the man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g .
fosterand he lives forty mile back here in the country ,  on the road to lafayette all right ,  i says ,  i can walk it in three days .
and i'll start this very afternoon no you wont ,  you'll start now ;  and don't you lose any time about it ,  neither ,  nor do any gabbling by the way .
just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along ,  and then you won't get into trouble with us ,  d'ye hear that was the order i wanted ,  and that was the one i played for .
i wanted to be left free to work my plans .
so clear out ,  he says ;  and you can tell mr. foster whatever you want to .
maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersome idiots don't require documentsleastways i've heard there's such down south here .
and when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus ,  maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out .
go 'long now ,  and tell him anything you want to ;  but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there so i left ,  and struck for the back country .
i didn't look around ,  but i kinder felt like he was watching me .
but i knowed i could tire him out at that .
i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped ;  then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps' .
i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around ,  because i wanted to stop jim's mouth till these fellows could get away .
i didn't want no trouble with their kind .
i'd seen all i wanted to of them ,  and wanted to get entirely shut of them .
when i got there it was all still and sundaylike ,  and hot and sunshiny ;  the hands was gone to the fields ;  and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone ;  and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful ,  because you feel like it's spirits whisperingspirits that's been dead ever so many yearsand you always think they're talking about you .
as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead ,  too ,  and done with it all .
phelps' was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations ,  and they all look alike .
a rail fence round a twoacre yard ;  a stile made out of logs sawed off and upended in steps ,  like barrels of a different length ,  to climb over the fence with ,  and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse ;  some sickly grasspatches in the big yard ,  but mostly it was bare and smooth ,  like an old hat with the nap rubbed off ;  big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs ,  with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar ,  and these mudstripes been whitewashed some time or another ;  roundlog kitchen ,  with a big broad ,  open but roofed passage joining it to the house ;  log smokehouse back of the kitchen ;  three little log niggercabins in a row t'other side the smokehouse ;  one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence ,  and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ;  ashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut ;  bench by the kitchen door ,  with bucket of water and a gourd ;  hound asleep there in the sun ;  more hounds asleep round about ;  about three shade trees away off in a corner ;  some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence ;  outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch ;  then the cotton fields begins ,  and after the fields the woods .
i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper ,  and started for the kitchen .
when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again ;  and then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world .
i went right along ,  not fixing up any particular plan ,  but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come ;  for i'd noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone .
when i got halfway ,  first one hound and then another got up and went for me ,  and of course i stopped and faced them ,  and kept still .
and such another powwow as they made !
in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel ,  as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of fifteen of them packed together around me ,  with their necks and noses stretched up towards me ,  abarking and howling ;  and more acoming ;  you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres .
a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her hand ,  singing out ,  begone you tige !
you spot !
begone sah and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling ,  and then the rest followed ;  and the next second half of them come back ,  wagging their tails around me ,  and making friends with me .
there ain't no harm in a hound ,  nohow .
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but towlinen shirts ,  and they hung on to their mother's gown ,  and peeped out from behind her at me ,  bashful ,  the way they always do .
and here comes the white woman running from the house ,  about fortyfive or fifty year old ,  bareheaded ,  and her spinningstick in her hand ;  and behind her comes her little white children ,  acting the same way the little niggers was doing .
she was smiling all over so she could hardly standand says :  it's you ,  at lastain't it i out with a yes'm before i thought .
she grabbed me and hugged me tight ;  and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ;  and the tears come in her eyes ,  and run down over ;  and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough ,  and kept saying ,  you don't look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would ;  but law sakes ,  i don't care for that ,  i'm so glad to see you !
dear ,  dear ,  it does seem like i could eat you up !
children ,  it's your cousin tomtell him howdy but they ducked their heads ,  and put their fingers in their mouths ,  and hid behind her .
so she run on :  lize ,  hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get your breakfast on the boat i said i had got it on the boat .
so then she started for the house ,  leading me by the hand ,  and the children tagging after .
when we got there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair ,  and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me ,  holding both of my hands ,  and says :  now i can have a good look at you ;  and ,  lawsame ,  i've been hungry for it a many and a many a time ,  all these long years ,  and it's come at last !
we been expecting you a couple of days and more .
what kep' youboat get aground yes'mshe don't say yes'msay aunt sally .
where'd she get aground i didn't rightly know what to say ,  because i didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down .
but i go a good deal on instinct ;  and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans .
that didn't help me much ,  though ;  for i didn't know the names of bars down that way .
i see i'd got to invent a bar ,  or forget the name of the one we got aground onornow i struck an idea ,  and fetched it out :  it warn't the groundingthat didn't keep us back but a little .
we blowed out a cylinderhead good gracious !
anybody hurt no'm .
killed a nigger well ,  it's lucky ;  because sometimes people do get hurt .
two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook ,  and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man .
and i think he died afterwards .
he was a baptist .
your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well .
yes ,  i remember now ,  he did die .
mortification set in ,  and they had to amputate him .
but it didn't save him .
yes ,  it was mortificationthat was it .
he turned blue all over ,  and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection .
they say he was a sight to look at .
your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you .
and he's gone again ,  not more'n an hour ago ;  he'll be back any minute now .
you must a met him on the road ,  didn't youoldish man ,  with a no ,  i didn't see nobody ,  aunt sally .
the boat landed just at daylight ,  and i left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country ,  to put in the time and not get here too soon ;  and so i come down the back way who'd you give the baggage to nobody why ,  child ,  it 'll be stole not where i hid it i reckon it won't ,  i says .
how'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat it was kinder thin ice ,  but i says :  the captain see me standing around ,  and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore ;  so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch ,  and give me all i wanted i was getting so uneasy i couldn't listen good .
i had my mind on the children all the time ;  i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little ,  and find out who i was .
but i couldn't get no show ,  mrs. phelps kept it up and run on so .
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back ,  because she says :  but here we're arunning on this way ,  and you hain't told me a word about sis ,  nor any of them .
now i'll rest my works a little ,  and you start up yourn ;  just tell me everythingtell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ;  and how they are ,  and what they're doing ,  and what they told you to tell me ;  and every last thing you can think of well ,  i see i was up a stumpand up it good .
providence had stood by me this fur all right ,  but i was hard and tight aground now .
i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go aheadi'd got to throw up my hand .
so i says to myself ,  here's another place where i got to resk the truth .
i opened my mouth to begin ;  but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed ,  and says :  here he comes !
stick your head down lowerthere ,  that'll do ;  you can't be seen now .
don't you let on you're here .
i'll play a joke on him .
children ,  don't you say a word i see i was in a fix now .
but it warn't no use to worry ;  there warn't nothing to do but just hold still ,  and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck .
i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ;  then the bed hid him .
mrs .
phelps she jumps for him ,  and says :  has he come no ,  says her husband .
goodness gracious she says ,  what in the warld can have become of him i can't imagine ,  says the old gentleman ;  and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy uneasy she says ;  i'm ready to go distracted !
he must a come ;  and you've missed him along the road .
i know it's sosomething tells me so why ,  sally ,  i couldn't miss him along the roadyou know that but oh ,  dear ,  dear ,  what will sis say !
he must a come !
you must a missed him .
he oh ,  don't distress me any more'n i'm already distressed .
i don't know what in the world to make of it .
i'm at my wit's end ,  and i don't mind acknowledging 't i'm right down scared .
but there's no hope that he's come ;  for he couldn't come and me miss him .
sally ,  it's terriblejust terriblesomething's happened to the boat ,  sure why ,  silas !
look yonderup the roadain't that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed ,  and that give mrs. phelps the chance she wanted .
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull ,  and out i come ;  and when he turned back from the window there she stood ,  abeaming and asmiling like a house afire ,  and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside .
the old gentleman stared ,  and says :  why ,  who's that who do you reckon 't is i hain't no idea .
who is it it's tom sawyer by jings ,  i most slumped through the floor !
but there warn't no time to swap knives ;  the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook ,  and kept on shaking ;  and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ;  and then how they both did fire off questions about sid ,  and mary ,  and the rest of the tribe .
but if they was joyful ,  it warn't nothing to what i was ;  for it was like being born again ,  i was so glad to find out who i was .
well ,  they froze to me for two hours ;  and at last ,  when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more ,  i had told them more about my familyi mean the sawyer familythan ever happened to any six sawyer families .
and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of white river ,  and it took us three days to fix it .
which was all right ,  and worked firstrate ;  because they didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it .
if i'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well .
now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side ,  and pretty uncomfortable all up the other .
being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable ,  and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river .
then i says to myself ,  s'pose tom sawyer comes down on that boat ?
and s'pose he steps in here any minute ,  and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet ?
well ,  i couldn't have it that way ;  it wouldn't do at all .
i must go up the road and waylay him .
so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage .
the old gentleman was for going along with me ,  but i said no ,  i could drive the horse myself ,  and i druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me .
so i started for town in the wagon ,  and when i was halfway i see a wagon coming ,  and sure enough it was tom sawyer ,  and i stopped and waited till he come along .
i says hold on and it stopped alongside ,  and his mouth opened up like a trunk ,  and stayed so ;  and he swallowed two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat ,  and then says :  i hain't ever done you no harm .
you know that .
so ,  then ,  what you want to come back and ha'nt me for i says :  i hain't come backi hain't been gone when he heard my voice it righted him up some ,  but he warn't quite satisfied yet .
he says :  don't you play nothing on me ,  because i wouldn't on you .
honest injun now ,  you ain't a ghost honest injun ,  i ain't ,  i says .
welliiwell ,  that ought to settle it ,  of course ;  but i can't somehow seem to understand it no way .
looky here ,  warn't you ever murdered at all no .
i warn't ever murdered at alli played it on them .
you come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me so he done it ;  and it satisfied him ;  and he was that glad to see me again he didn't know what to do .
and he wanted to know all about it right off ,  because it was a grand adventure ,  and mysterious ,  and so it hit him where he lived .
but i said ,  leave it alone till by and by ;  and told his driver to wait ,  and we drove off a little piece ,  and i told him the kind of a fix i was in ,  and what did he reckon we better do ?
he said ,  let him alone a minute ,  and don't disturb him .
so he thought and thought ,  and pretty soon he says :  it's all right ;  i've got it .
take my trunk in your wagon ,  and let on it's your'n ;  and you turn back and fool along slow ,  so as to get to the house about the time you ought to ;  and i'll go towards town a piece ,  and take a fresh start ,  and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you ;  and you needn't let on to know me at first i says :  all right ;  but wait a minute .
there's one more thinga thing that nobody don't know but me .
and that is ,  there's a nigger here that i'm atrying to steal out of slavery ,  and his name is jimold miss watson's jim he says :  what !
why ,  jim is he stopped and went to studying .
i says :  i know what you'll say .
you'll say it's dirty ,  lowdown business ;  but what if it is ?
i'm low down ;  and i'm agoing to steal him ,  and i want you keep mum and not let on .
will you his eye lit up ,  and he says :  i'll help you steal him well ,  i let go all holts then ,  like i was shot .
it was the most astonishing speech i ever heardand i'm bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation .
only i couldn't believe it .
tom sawyer a niggerstealer oh ,  shucks i says ;  you're joking i ain't joking ,  either well ,  then ,  i says ,  joking or no joking ,  if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger ,  don't forget to remember that you don't know nothing about him ,  and i don't know nothing about him then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon ,  and he drove off his way and i drove mine .
but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ;  so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip .
the old gentleman was at the door ,  and he says :  why ,  this is wonderful !
whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ?
i wish we'd a timed her .
and she hain't sweated a hairnot a hair .
it's wonderful .
why ,  i wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse nowi wouldn't ,  honest ;  and yet i'd a sold her for fifteen before ,  and thought 'twas all she was worth that's all he said .
he was the innocentest ,  best old soul i ever see .
but it warn't surprising ;  because he warn't only just a farmer ,  he was a preacher ,  too ,  and had a little onehorse log church down back of the plantation ,  which he built it himself at his own expense ,  for a church and schoolhouse ,  and never charged nothing for his preaching ,  and it was worth it ,  too .
there was plenty other farmerpreachers like that ,  and done the same way ,  down south .
in about half an hour tom's wagon drove up to the front stile ,  and aunt sally she see it through the window ,  because it was only about fifty yards ,  and says :  why ,  there's somebody come !
i wonder who 'tis ?
why ,  i do believe it's a stranger .
jimmy that's one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner everybody made a rush for the front door ,  because ,  of course ,  a stranger don't come every year ,  and so he lays over the yallerfever ,  for interest ,  when he does come .
tom was over the stile and starting for the house ;  the wagon was spinning up the road for the village ,  and we was all bunched in the front door .
tom had his store clothes on ,  and an audienceand that was always nuts for tom sawyer .
in them circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable .
he warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ;  no ,  he come ca'm and important ,  like the ram .
when he got afront of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty ,  like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them ,  and says :  mr .
archibald nichols ,  i presume no ,  my boy ,  says the old gentleman ,  i'm sorry to say 't your driver has deceived you ;  nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more .
come in ,  come in tom he took a look back over his shoulder ,  and says ,  too latehe's out of sight yes ,  he's gone ,  my son ,  and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ;  and then we'll hitch up and take you down to nichols's oh ,  i can't make you so much trouble ;  i couldn't think of it .
i'll walki don't mind the distance but we won't let you walkit wouldn't be southern hospitality to do it .
come right in oh ,  do ,  says aunt sally ;  it ain't a bit of trouble to us ,  not a bit in the world .
you must stay .
it's a long ,  dusty three mile ,  and we can't let you walk .
and ,  besides ,  i've already told 'em to put on another plate when i see you coming ;  so you mustn't disappoint us .
come right in and make yourself at home so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome ,  and let himself be persuaded ,  and come in ;  and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ,  ohio ,  and his name was william thompsonand he made another bow .
well ,  he run on ,  and on ,  and on ,  making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent ,  and i getting a little nervious ,  and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ;  and at last ,  still talking along ,  he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth ,  and then settled back again in his chair comfortable ,  and was going on talking ;  but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand ,  and says :  you owdacious puppy he looked kind of hurt ,  and says :  i'm surprised at you ,  m'am you're s'rpwhy ,  what do you reckon i am ?
i've a good notion to take andsay ,  what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble ,  and says :  i didn't mean nothing ,  m'am .
i didn't mean no harm .
iithought you'd like it why ,  you born fool she took up the spinning stick ,  and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it .
what made you think i'd like it well ,  i don't know .
only ,  theytheytold me you would they told you i would .
whoever told you's another lunatic .
i never heard the beat of it .
who's they why ,  everybody .
they all said so ,  m'am it was all she could do to hold in ;  and her eyes snapped ,  and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ;  and she says :  who's 'everybody' ?
out with their names ,  or ther'll be an idiot short he got up and looked distressed ,  and fumbled his hat ,  and says :  i'm sorry ,  and i warn't expecting it .
they told me to .
they all told me to .
they all said ,  kiss her ;  and said she'd like it .
they all said itevery one of them .
but i'm sorry ,  m'am ,  and i won't do it no morei won't ,  honest you won't ,  won't you ?
well ,  i sh'd reckon you won't no'm ,  i'm honest about it ;  i won't ever do it againtill you ask me till i ask you !
well ,  i never see the beat of it in my born days !
i lay you'll be the methusalemnumskull of creation before ever i ask youor the likes of you well ,  he says ,  it does surprise me so .
i can't make it out ,  somehow .
they said you would ,  and i thought you would .
but he stopped and looked around slow ,  like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres ,  and fetched up on the old gentleman's ,  and says ,  didn't you think she'd like me to kiss her ,  sir why ,  no ;  iiwell ,  no ,  i b'lieve i didn't then he looks on around the same way to me ,  and says :  tom ,  didn't you think aunt sally 'd open out her arms and say ,  'sid sawyer' my land she says ,  breaking in and jumping for him ,  you impudent young rascal ,  to fool a body so and was going to hug him ,  but he fended her off ,  and says :  no ,  not till you've asked me first so she didn't lose no time ,  but asked him ;  and hugged him and kissed him over and over again ,  and then turned him over to the old man ,  and he took what was left .
and after they got a little quiet again she says :  why ,  dear me ,  i never see such a surprise .
we warn't looking for you at all ,  but only tom .
sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him it's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but tom ,  he says ;  but i begged and begged ,  and at the last minute she let me come ,  too ;  so ,  coming down the river ,  me and tom thought it would be a firstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first ,  and for me to by and by tag along and drop in ,  and let on to be a stranger .
but it was a mistake ,  aunt sally .
this ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come nonot impudent whelps ,  sid .
you ought to had your jaws boxed ;  i hain't been so put out since i don't know when .
but i don't care ,  i don't mind the termsi'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here .
well ,  to think of that performance !
i don't deny it ,  i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ;  and there was things enough on that table for seven familiesand all hot ,  too ;  none of your flabby ,  tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning .
uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it ,  but it was worth it ;  and it didn't cool it a bit ,  neither ,  the way i've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times .
there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon ,  and me and tom was on the lookout all the time ;  but it warn't no use ,  they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger ,  and we was afraid to try to work up to it .
but at supper ,  at night ,  one of the little boys says :  pa ,  mayn't tom and sid and me go to the show no ,  says the old man ,  i reckon there ain't going to be any ;  and you couldn't go if there was ;  because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show ,  and burton said he would tell the people ;  so i reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time so there it wasbut i couldn't help it .
tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ;  so ,  being tired ,  we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper ,  and clumb out of the window and down the lightningrod ,  and shoved for the town ;  for i didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint ,  and so if i didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure .
on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered ,  and how pap disappeared pretty soon ,  and didn't come back no more ,  and what a stir there was when jim run away ;  and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions ,  and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to ;  and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of itit was as much as halfafter eight ,  thenhere comes a raging rush of people with torches ,  and an awful whooping and yelling ,  and banging tin pans and blowing horns ;  and we jumped to one side to let them go by ;  and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a railthat is ,  i knowed it was the king and the duke ,  though they was all over tar and feathers ,  and didn't look like nothing in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldierplumes .
well ,  it made me sick to see it ;  and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals ,  it seemed like i couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world .
it was a dreadful thing to see .
human beings can be awful cruel to one another .
we see we was too latecouldn't do no good .
we asked some stragglers about it ,  and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ;  and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ;  then somebody give a signal ,  and the house rose up and went for them .
so we poked along back home ,  and i warn't feeling so brash as i was before ,  but kind of ornery ,  and humble ,  and to blame ,  somehowthough i hadn't done nothing .
but that's always the way ;  it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong ,  a person's conscience ain't got no sense ,  and just goes for him anyway .
if i had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does i would pison him .
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides ,  and yet ain't no good ,  nohow .
tom sawyer he says the same .
we stopped talking ,  and got to thinking .
by and by tom says :  looky here ,  huck ,  what fools we are to not think of it before !
i bet i know where jim is no !
where in that hut down by the ashhopper .
why ,  looky here .
when we was at dinner ,  didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog so 'd i .
well ,  it wasn't for a dog why because part of it was watermelon so it wasi noticed it .
well ,  it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon .
it shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time well ,  the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in ,  and he locked it again when he came out .
he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from tablesame key ,  i bet .
watermelon shows man ,  lock shows prisoner ;  and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation ,  and where the people's all so kind and good .
jim's the prisoner .
all righti'm glad we found it out detective fashion ;  i wouldn't give shucks for any other way .
now you work your mind ,  and study out a plan to steal jim ,  and i will study out one ,  too ;  and we'll take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have !
if i had tom sawyer's head i wouldn't trade it off to be a duke ,  nor mate of a steamboat ,  nor clown in a circus ,  nor nothing i can think of .
i went to thinking out a plan ,  but only just to be doing something ;  i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from .
pretty soon tom says :  ready yes ,  i says .
all rightbring it out my plan is this ,  i says .
we can easy find out if it's jim in there .
then get up my canoe tomorrow night ,  and fetch my raft over from the island .
then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed ,  and shove off down the river on the raft with jim ,  hiding daytimes and running nights ,  the way me and jim used to do before .
wouldn't that plan work work ?
why ,  cert'nly it would work ,  like rats afighting .
but it's too blame' simple ;  there ain't nothing to it .
what's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that ?
it's as mild as goosemilk .
why ,  huck ,  it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory i never said nothing ,  because i warn't expecting nothing different ;  but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it .
and it didn't .
he told me what it was ,  and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style ,  and would make jim just as free a man as mine would ,  and maybe get us all killed besides .
so i was satisfied ,  and said we would waltz in on it .
i needn't tell what it was here ,  because i knowed it wouldn't stay the way ,  it was .
i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along ,  and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance .
and that is what he done .
well ,  one thing was dead sure ,  and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest ,  and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery .
that was the thing that was too many for me .
here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ;  and had a character to lose ;  and folks at home that had characters ;  and he was bright and not leatherheaded ;  and knowing and not ignorant ;  and not mean ,  but kind ;  and yet here he was ,  without any more pride ,  or rightness ,  or feeling ,  than to stoop to this business ,  and make himself a shame ,  and his family a shame ,  before everybody .
i couldn't understand it no way at all .
it was outrageous ,  and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so ;  and so be his true friend ,  and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself .
and i did start to tell him ;  but he shut me up ,  and says :  don't you reckon i know what i'm about ?
don't i generly know what i'm about yes didn't i say i was going to help steal the nigger yes well ,  then that's all he said ,  and that's all i said .
it warn't no use to say any more ;  because when he said he'd do a thing ,  he always done it .
but i couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ;  so i just let it go ,  and never bothered no more about it .
if he was bound to have it so ,  i couldn't help it .
when we got home the house was all dark and still ;  so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it .
we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do .
they knowed us ,  and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night .
when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ;  and on the side i warn't acquainted withwhich was the north sidewe found a square windowhole ,  up tolerable high ,  with just one stout board nailed across it .
i says :  here's the ticket .
this hole's big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom says :  it's as simple as tittattoe ,  threeinarow ,  and as easy as playing hooky .
i should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated than that ,  huck finn well ,  then ,  i says ,  how 'll it do to saw him out ,  the way i done before i was murdered that time that's more like ,  he says .
it's real mysterious ,  and troublesome ,  and good ,  he says ;  but i bet we can find a way that's twice as long .
there ain't no hurry ;  le's keep on looking around betwixt the hut and the fence ,  on the back side ,  was a leanto that joined the hut at the eaves ,  and was made out of plank .
it was as long as the hut ,  but narrowonly about six foot wide .
the door to it was at the south end ,  and was padlocked .
tom he went to the soapkettle and searched around ,  and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ;  so he took it and prized out one of the staples .
the chain fell down ,  and we opened the door and went in ,  and shut it ,  and struck a match ,  and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with it ;  and there warn't no floor to the shed ,  nor nothing in it but some old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow .
the match went out ,  and so did we ,  and shoved in the staple again ,  and the door was locked as good as ever .
tom was joyful .
he says ;  now we're all right .
we'll dig him out .
it 'll take about a week then we started for the house ,  and i went in the back dooryou only have to pull a buckskin latchstring ,  they don't fasten the doorsbut that warn't romantical enough for tom sawyer ;  no way would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod .
but after he got up half way about three times ,  and missed fire and fell every time ,  and the last time most busted his brains out ,  he thought he'd got to give it up ;  but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck ,  and this time he made the trip .
in the morning we was up at break of day ,  and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was being fed .
the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ;  and jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ;  and whilst the others was leaving ,  the key come from the house .
this nigger had a goodnatured ,  chuckleheaded face ,  and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread .
that was to keep witches off .
he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights ,  and making him see all kinds of strange things ,  and hear all kinds of strange words and noises ,  and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
he got so worked up ,  and got to running on so about his troubles ,  he forgot all about what he'd been agoing to do .
so tom says :  what's the vittles for ?
going to feed the dogs the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face ,  like when you heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle ,  and he says :  yes ,  mars sid ,  a dog .
cur'us dog ,  too .
does you want to go en look at 'im yes i hunched tom ,  and whispers :  you going ,  right here in the daybreak ?
that warn't the plan no ,  it warn't ;  but it's the plan now so ,  drat him ,  we went along ,  but i didn't like it much .
when we got in we couldn't hardly see anything ,  it was so dark ;  but jim was there ,  sure enough ,  and could see us ;  and he sings out :  why ,  huck !
en good lan' !
ain' dat misto tom i just knowed how it would be ;  i just expected it .
i didn't know nothing to do ;  and if i had i couldn't a done it ,  because that nigger busted in and says :  why ,  de gracious sakes !
do he know you genlmen we could see pretty well now .
tom he looked at the nigger ,  steady and kind of wondering ,  and says :  does who know us why ,  disyer runaway nigger i don't reckon he does ;  but what put that into your head what put it dar ?
didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you tom says ,  in a puzzledup kind of way :  well ,  that's mighty curious .
who sung out ?
when did he sing out ?
what did he sing out and turns to me ,  perfectly ca'm ,  and says ,  did you hear anybody sing out of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing ;  so i says :  no ;  i ain't heard nobody say nothing then he turns to jim ,  and looks him over like he never see him before ,  and says :  did you sing out no ,  sah ,  says jim ;  i hain't said nothing ,  sah not a word no ,  sah ,  i hain't said a word did you ever see us before no ,  sah ;  not as i knows on so tom turns to the nigger ,  which was looking wild and distressed ,  and says ,  kind of severe :  what do you reckon's the matter with you ,  anyway ?
what made you think somebody sung out oh ,  it's de dadblame' witches ,  sah ,  en i wisht i was dead ,  i do .
dey's awluz at it ,  sah ,  en dey do mos' kill me ,  dey sk'yers me so .
please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah ,  er ole mars silas he'll scole me ;  'kase he say dey ain't no witches .
i jis' wish to goodness he was heah nowden what would he say !
i jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it dis time .
but it's awluz jis' so ;  people dat's sot ,  stays sot ;  dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves ,  en when you fine it out en tell um 'bout it ,  dey doan' b'lieve you tom give him a dime ,  and said we wouldn't tell nobody ;  and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ;  and then looks at jim ,  and says :  i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger .
if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away ,  i wouldn't give him up ,  i'd hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good ,  he whispers to jim and says :  don't ever let on to know us .
and if you hear any digging going on nights ,  it's us ;  we're going to set you free jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ;  then the nigger come back ,  and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ;  and he said he would ,  more particular if it was dark ,  because the witches went for him mostly in the dark ,  and it was good to have folks around then .
it would be most an hour yet till breakfast ,  so we left and struck down into the woods ;  because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by ,  and a lantern makes too much ,  and might get us into trouble ;  what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called foxfire ,  and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place .
we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds ,  and set down to rest ,  and tom says ,  kind of dissatisfied :  blame it ,  this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be .
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan .
there ain't no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman .
there ain't even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to .
and there's jim chained by one leg ,  with a tenfoot chain ,  to the leg of his bed :  why ,  all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain .
and uncle silas he trusts everybody ;  sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger ,  and don't send nobody to watch the nigger .
jim could a got out of that windowhole before this ,  only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg .
why ,  drat it ,  huck ,  it's the stupidest arrangement i ever see .
you got to invent all the difficulties .
well ,  we can't help it ;  we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got .
anyhow ,  there's one thingthere's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers ,  where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them ,  and you had to contrive them all out of your own head .
now look at just that one thing of the lantern .
when you come down to the cold facts ,  we simply got to let on that a lantern's resky .
why ,  we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to ,  i believe .
now ,  whilst i think of it ,  we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it ?
hain't we got to saw the leg of jim's bed off ,  so as to get the chain loose why ,  you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well ,  if that ain't just like you ,  huck finn .
you can get up the infantschooliest ways of going at a thing .
why ,  hain't you ever read any books at allbaron trenck ,  nor casanova ,  nor benvenuto chelleeny ,  nor henri iv ,  nor none of them heroes ?
who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that ?
no ;  the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two ,  and leave it just so ,  and swallow the sawdust ,  so it can't be found ,  and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's being sawed ,  and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound .
then ,  the night you're ready ,  fetch the leg a kick ,  down she goes ;  slip off your chain ,  and there you are .
nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements ,  shin down it ,  break your leg in the moatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short ,  you knowand there's your horses and your trusty vassles ,  and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle ,  and away you go to your native langudoc ,  or navarre ,  or wherever it is .
it's gaudy ,  huck .
i wish there was a moat to this cabin .
if we get time ,  the night of the escape ,  we'll dig one i says :  what do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me .
he had forgot me and everything else .
he had his chin in his hand ,  thinking .
pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ;  then sighs again ,  and says :  no ,  it wouldn't dothere ain't necessity enough for it for what i says .
why ,  to saw jim's leg off ,  he says .
good land i says ;  why ,  there ain't no necessity for it .
and what would you want to saw his leg off for ,  anyway well ,  some of the best authorities has done it .
they couldn't get the chain off ,  so they just cut their hand off and shoved .
and a leg would be better still .
but we got to let that go .
there ain't necessity enough in this case ;  and ,  besides ,  jim's a nigger ,  and wouldn't understand the reasons for it ,  and how it's the custom in europe ;  so we'll let it go .
but there's one thinghe can have a rope ladder ;  we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough .
and we can send it to him in a pie ;  it's mostly done that way .
and i've et worse pies why ,  tom sawyer ,  how you talk ,  i says ;  jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it .
how you talk ,  you better say ;  you don't know nothing about it .
he's got to have a rope ladder ;  they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it ?
he can hide it in his bed ,  can't he that's what they all do ;  and he's got to ,  too .
huck ,  you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular ;  you want to be starting something fresh all the time .
s'pose he don't do nothing with it ?
ain't it there in his bed ,  for a clew ,  after he's gone ?
and don't you reckon they'll want clews ?
of course they will .
and you wouldn't leave them any ?
that would be a pretty howdydo ,  wouldn't it !
i never heard of such a thing well ,  i says ,  if it's in the regulations ,  and he's got to have it ,  all right ,  let him have it ;  because i don't wish to go back on no regulations ;  but there's one thing ,  tom sawyerif we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder ,  we're going to get into trouble with aunt sally ,  just as sure as you're born .
now ,  the way i look at it ,  a hickrybark ladder don't cost nothing ,  and don't waste nothing ,  and is just as good to load up a pie with ,  and hide in a straw tick ,  as any rag ladder you can start ;  and as for jim ,  he ain't had no experience ,  and so he don't care what kind of a oh ,  shucks ,  huck finn ,  if i was as ignorant as you i'd keep stillthat's what i'd do .
who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickrybark ladder ?
why ,  it's perfectly ridiculous well ,  all right ,  tom ,  fix it your own way ;  but if you'll take my advice ,  you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline he said that would do .
and that gave him another idea ,  and he says :  borrow a shirt ,  too what do we want of a shirt ,  tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your grannyjim can't write s'pose he can't writehe can make marks on the shirt ,  can't he ,  if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop why ,  tom ,  we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ;  and quicker ,  too prisoners don't have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of ,  you muggins .
they always make their pens out of the hardest ,  toughest ,  troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ;  and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out ,  too ,  because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall .
they wouldn't use a goosequill if they had it .
it ain't regular well ,  then ,  what'll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of ironrust and tears ;  but that's the common sort and women ;  the best authorities uses their own blood .
jim can do that ;  and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated ,  he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window .
the iron mask always done that ,  and it's a blame' good way ,  too jim ain't got no tin plates .
they feed him in a pan that ain't nothing ;  we can get him some can't nobody read his plates that ain't got anything to do with it ,  huck finn .
all he's got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out .
you don't have to be able to read it .
why ,  half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate ,  or anywhere else well ,  then ,  what's the sense in wasting the plates why ,  blame it all ,  it ain't the prisoner's plates but it's somebody's plates ,  ain't it well ,  spos'n it is ?
what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there ,  because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing .
so we cleared out for the house .
along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothesline ;  and i found an old sack and put them in it ,  and we went down and got the foxfire ,  and put that in too .
i called it borrowing ,  because that was what pap always called it ;  but tom said it warn't borrowing ,  it was stealing .
he said we was representing prisoners ;  and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it ,  and nobody don't blame them for it ,  either .
it ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with ,  tom said ;  it's his right ;  and so ,  as long as we was representing a prisoner ,  we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with .
he said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very different thing ,  and nobody but a mean ,  ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner .
so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy .
and yet he made a mighty fuss ,  one day ,  after that ,  when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it ;  and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for .
tom said that what he meant was ,  we could steal anything we needed .
well ,  i says ,  i needed the watermelon .
but he said i didn't need it to get out of prison with ;  there's where the difference was .
he said if i'd a wanted it to hide a knife in ,  and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with ,  it would a been all right .
so i let it go at that ,  though i couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon .
well ,  as i was saying ,  we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business ,  and nobody in sight around the yard ;  then tom he carried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch .
by and by he come out ,  and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk .
he says :  everything's all right now except tools ;  and that's easy fixed tools i says .
yes tools for what why ,  to dig with .
we ain't agoing to gnaw him out ,  are we ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says .
he turns on me ,  looking pitying enough to make a body cry ,  and says :  huck finn ,  did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels ,  and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ?
now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero ?
why ,  they might as well lend him the key and done with it .
picks and shovelswhy ,  they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king well ,  then ,  i says ,  if we don't want the picks and shovels ,  what do we want a couple of caseknives to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it ,  it's foolish ,  tom it don't make no difference how foolish it is ,  it's the right wayand it's the regular way .
and there ain't no other way ,  that ever i heard of ,  and i've read all the books that gives any information about these things .
they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt ,  mind you ;  generly it's through solid rock .
and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks ,  and for ever and ever .
why ,  look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef ,  in the harbor of marseilles ,  that dug himself out that way ;  how long was he at it ,  you reckon i don't know well ,  guess i don't know .
a month and a half thirtyseven yearand he come out in china .
that's the kind .
i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim don't know nobody in china what's that got to do with it ?
neither did that other fellow .
but you're always awandering off on a side issue .
why can't you stick to the main point all righti don't care where he comes out ,  so he comes out ;  and jim don't ,  either ,  i reckon .
but there's one thing ,  anywayjim's too old to be dug out with a caseknife .
he won't last yes he will last ,  too .
you don't reckon it's going to take thirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation ,  do you how long will it take ,  tom well ,  we can't resk being as long as we ought to ,  because it mayn't take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans .
he'll hear jim ain't from there .
then his next move will be to advertise jim ,  or something like that .
so we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to .
by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years ;  but we can't .
things being so uncertain ,  what i recommend is this :  that we really dig right in ,  as quick as we can ;  and after that ,  we can let on ,  to ourselves ,  that we was at it thirtyseven years .
then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm .
yes ,  i reckon that 'll be the best way now ,  there's sense in that ,  i says .
letting on don't cost nothing ;  letting on ain't no trouble ;  and if it's any object ,  i don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year .
it wouldn't strain me none ,  after i got my hand in .
so i'll mosey along now ,  and smouch a couple of caseknives smouch three ,  he says ;  we want one to make a saw out of tom ,  if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it ,  i says ,  there's an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smokehouse he looked kind of weary and discouragedlike ,  and says :  it ain't no use to try to learn you nothing ,  huck .
run along and smouch the knivesthree of them so i done it .
as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightningrod ,  and shut ourselves up in the leanto ,  and got out our pile of foxfire ,  and went to work .
we cleared everything out of the way ,  about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log .
tom said he was right behind jim's bed now ,  and we'd dig in under it ,  and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there ,  because jim's counterpin hung down most to the ground ,  and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole .
so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight ;  and then we was dogtired ,  and our hands was blistered ,  and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly .
at last i says :  this ain't no thirtyseven year job ;  this is a thirtyeight year job ,  tom sawyer he never said nothing .
but he sighed ,  and pretty soon he stopped digging ,  and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking .
then he says :  it ain't no use ,  huck ,  it ain't agoing to work .
if we was prisoners it would ,  because then we'd have as many years as we wanted ,  and no hurry ;  and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig ,  every day ,  while they was changing watches ,  and so our hands wouldn't get blistered ,  and we could keep it up right along ,  year in and year out ,  and do it right ,  and the way it ought to be done .
but we can't fool along ;  we got to rush ;  we ain't got no time to spare .
if we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldn't touch a caseknife with them sooner well ,  then ,  what we going to do ,  tom i'll tell you .
it ain't right ,  and it ain't moral ,  and i wouldn't like it to get out ;  but there ain't only just the one way :  we got to dig him out with the picks ,  and let on it's caseknives now you're talking i says ;  your head gets leveler and leveler all the time ,  tom sawyer ,  i says .
picks is the thing ,  moral or no moral ;  and as for me ,  i don't care shucks for the morality of it ,  nohow .
when i start in to steal a nigger ,  or a watermelon ,  or a sundayschool book ,  i ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done .
what i want is my nigger ;  or what i want is my watermelon ;  or what i want is my sundayschool book ;  and if a pick's the handiest thing ,  that's the thing i'm agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with ;  and i don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther well ,  he says ,  there's excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like this ;  if it warn't so ,  i wouldn't approve of it ,  nor i wouldn't stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right ,  and wrong is wrong ,  and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better .
it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick ,  without any letting on ,  because you don't know no better ;  but it wouldn't for me ,  because i do know better .
gimme a caseknife he had his own by him ,  but i handed him mine .
he flung it down ,  and says :  gimme a caseknife i didn't know just what to dobut then i thought .
i scratched around amongst the old tools ,  and got a pickaxe and give it to him ,  and he took it and went to work ,  and never said a word .
he was always just that particular .
full of principle .
so then i got a shovel ,  and then we picked and shoveled ,  turn about ,  and made the fur fly .
we stuck to it about a half an hour ,  which was as long as we could stand up ;  but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it .
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightningrod ,  but he couldn't come it ,  his hands was so sore .
at last he says :  it ain't no use ,  it can't be done .
what you reckon i better do ?
can't you think of no way yes ,  i says ,  but i reckon it ain't regular .
come up the stairs ,  and let on it's a lightningrod so he done it .
next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house ,  for to make some pens for jim out of ,  and six tallow candles ;  and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance ,  and stole three tin plates .
tom says it wasn't enough ;  but i said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that jim throwed out ,  because they'd fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again .
so tom was satisfied .
then he says :  now ,  the thing to study out is ,  how to get the things to jim take them in through the hole ,  i says ,  when we get it done he only just looked scornful ,  and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea ,  and then he went to studying .
by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways ,  but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet .
said we'd got to post jim first .
that night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten ,  and took one of the candles along ,  and listened under the windowhole ,  and heard jim snoring ;  so we pitched it in ,  and it didn't wake him .
then we whirled in with the pick and shovel ,  and in about two hours and a half the job was done .
we crept in under jim's bed and into the cabin ,  and pawed around and found the candle and lit it ,  and stood over jim awhile ,  and found him looking hearty and healthy ,  and then we woke him up gentle and gradual .
he was so glad to see us he most cried ;  and called us honey ,  and all the pet names he could think of ;  and was for having us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away ,  and clearing out without losing any time .
but tom he showed him how unregular it would be ,  and set down and told him all about our plans ,  and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ;  and not to be the least afraid ,  because we would see he got away ,  sure .
so jim he said it was all right ,  and we set there and talked over old times awhile ,  and then tom asked a lot of questions ,  and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him ,  and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat ,  and both of them was kind as they could be ,  tom says :  now i know how to fix it .
we'll send you some things by them i said ,  don't do nothing of the kind ;  it's one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck ;  but he never paid no attention to me ;  went right on .
it was his way when he'd got his plans set .
so he told jim how we'd have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by nat ,  the nigger that fed him ,  and he must be on the lookout ,  and not be surprised ,  and not let nat see him open them ;  and we would put small things in uncle's coatpockets and he must steal them out ;  and we would tie things to aunt's apronstrings or put them in her apronpocket ,  if we got a chance ;  and told him what they would be and what they was for .
and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood ,  and all that .
he told him everything .
jim he couldn't see no sense in the most of it ,  but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ;  so he was satisfied ,  and said he would do it all just as tom said .
jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco ;  so we had a right down good sociable time ;  then we crawled out through the hole ,  and so home to bed ,  with hands that looked like they'd been chawed .
tom was in high spirits .
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life ,  and the most intellectural ;  and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out ;  for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it .
he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year ,  and would be the best time on record .
and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it .
in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes ,  and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket .
then we went to the nigger cabins ,  and while i got nat's notice off ,  tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a cornpone that was in jim's pan ,  and we went along with nat to see how it would work ,  and it just worked noble ;  when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ;  and there warn't ever anything could a worked better .
tom said so himself .
jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread ,  you know ;  but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first .
and whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light ,  here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim's bed ;  and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them ,  and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath .
by jings ,  we forgot to fasten that leanto door !
the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once ,  and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs ,  and begun to groan like he was dying .
tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim's meat ,  and the dogs went for it ,  and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door ,  and i knowed he'd fixed the other door too .
then he went to work on the nigger ,  coaxing him and petting him ,  and asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again .
he raised up ,  and blinked his eyes around ,  and says :  mars sid ,  you'll say i's a fool ,  but if i didn't b'lieve i see most a million dogs ,  er devils ,  er some'n ,  i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks .
i did ,  mos' sholy .
mars sid ,  i felt umi felt um ,  sah ;  dey was all over me .
dad fetch it ,  i jis' wisht i could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunston'y jis' wunstit's all i'd ast .
but mos'ly i wisht dey'd lemme 'lone ,  i does tom says :  well ,  i tell you what i think .
what makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfasttime ?
it's because they're hungry ;  that's the reason .
you make them a witch pie ;  that's the thing for you to do but my lan' ,  mars sid ,  how's i gwyne to make 'm a witch pie ?
i doan' know how to make it .
i hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo' well ,  then ,  i'll have to make it myself will you do it ,  honeywill you ?
i'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot ,  i will all right ,  i'll do it ,  seeing it's you ,  and you've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger .
but you got to be mighty careful .
when we come around ,  you turn your back ;  and then whatever we've put in the pan ,  don't you let on you see it at all .
and don't you look when jim unloads the pansomething might happen ,  i don't know what .
and above all ,  don't you handle the witchthings hannel 'm ,  mars sid ?
what is you atalkin' 'bout ?
i wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um ,  not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars ,  i wouldn't that was all fixed .
so then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in the back yard ,  where they keep the old boots ,  and rags ,  and pieces of bottles ,  and woreout tin things ,  and all such truck ,  and scratched around and found an old tin washpan ,  and stopped up the holes as well as we could ,  to bake the pie in ,  and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast ,  and found a couple of shinglenails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with ,  and dropped one of them in aunt sally's apronpocket which was hanging on a chair ,  and t'other we stuck in the band of uncle silas's hat ,  which was on the bureau ,  because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning ,  and then went to breakfast ,  and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silas's coatpocket ,  and aunt sally wasn't come yet ,  so we had to wait a little while .
and when she come she was hot and red and cross ,  and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing ;  and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other ,  and says :  i've hunted high and i've hunted low ,  and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things ,  and a hard piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough ,  and was shot across the table ,  and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm ,  and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop ,  and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills ,  and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that ,  and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder .
but after that we was all right againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold .
uncle silas he says :  it's most uncommon curious ,  i can't understand it .
i know perfectly well i took it off ,  because because you hain't got but one on .
just listen at the man !
i know you took it off ,  and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory ,  too ,  because it was on the clo'sline yesterdayi see it there myself .
but it's gone ,  that's the long and the short of it ,  and you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till i can get time to make a new one .
and it 'll be the third i've made in two years .
it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts ;  and whatever you do manage to do with 'm all is more'n i can make out .
a body 'd think you would learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life i know it ,  sally ,  and i do try all i can .
but it oughtn't to be altogether my fault ,  because ,  you know ,  i don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me ;  and i don't believe i've ever lost one of them off of me well ,  it ain't your fault if you haven't ,  silas ;  you'd a done it if you could ,  i reckon .
and the shirt ain't all that's gone ,  nuther .
ther's a spoon gone ;  and that ain't all .
there was ten ,  and now ther's only nine .
the calf got the shirt ,  i reckon ,  but the calf never took the spoon ,  that's certain why ,  what else is gone ,  sally ther's six candles gonethat's what .
the rats could a got the candles ,  and i reckon they did ;  i wonder they don't walk off with the whole place ,  the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it ;  and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair ,  silasyou'd never find it out ;  but you can't lay the spoon on the rats ,  and that i know well ,  sally ,  i'm in fault ,  and i acknowledge it ;  i've been remiss ;  but i won't let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes oh ,  i wouldn't hurry ;  next year 'll do .
matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble ,  and the child snatches her claws out of the sugarbowl without fooling around any .
just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage ,  and says :  missus ,  dey's a sheet gone a sheet gone !
well ,  for the land's sake i'll stop up them holes today ,  says uncle silas ,  looking sorrowful .
oh ,  do shet ups'pose the rats took the sheet ?
where's it gone ,  lize clah to goodness i hain't no notion ,  miss' sally .
she wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy ,  but she done gone :  she ain' dah no mo' now i reckon the world is coming to an end .
i never see the beat of it in all my born days .
a shirt ,  and a sheet ,  and a spoon ,  and six can missus ,  comes a young yaller wench ,  dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n cler out from here ,  you hussy ,  er i'll take a skillet to ye well ,  she was just abiling .
i begun to lay for a chance ;  i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated .
she kept araging right along ,  running her insurrection all by herself ,  and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ;  and at last uncle silas ,  looking kind of foolish ,  fishes up that spoon out of his pocket .
she stopped ,  with her mouth open and her hands up ;  and as for me ,  i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres .
but not long ,  because she says :  it's just as i expected .
so you had it in your pocket all the time ;  and like as not you've got the other things there ,  too .
how'd it get there i reely don't know ,  sally ,  he says ,  kind of apologizing ,  or you know i would tell .
i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast ,  and i reckon i put it in there ,  not noticing ,  meaning to put my testament in ,  and it must be so ,  because my testament ain't in ;  but i'll go and see ;  and if the testament is where i had it ,  i'll know i didn't put it in ,  and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon ,  and oh ,  for the land's sake !
give a body a rest !
go 'long now ,  the whole kit and biling of ye ;  and don't come nigh me again till i've got back my peace of mind i'd a heard her if she'd a said it to herself ,  let alone speaking it out ;  and i'd a got up and obeyed her if i'd a been dead .
as we was passing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat ,  and the shinglenail fell out on the floor ,  and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantelshelf ,  and never said nothing ,  and went out .
tom see him do it ,  and remembered about the spoon ,  and says :  well ,  it ain't no use to send things by him no more ,  he ain't reliable then he says :  but he done us a good turn with the spoon ,  anyway ,  without knowing it ,  and so we'll go and do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes there was a noble good lot of them down cellar ,  and it took us a whole hour ,  but we done the job tight and good and shipshape .
then we heard steps on the stairs ,  and blowed out our light and hid ;  and here comes the old man ,  with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other ,  looking as absentminded as year before last .
he went a mooning around ,  first to one rathole and then another ,  till he'd been to them all .
then he stood about five minutes ,  picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking .
then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs ,  saying :  well ,  for the life of me i can't remember when i done it .
i could show her now that i warn't to blame on account of the rats .
but never mindlet it go .
i reckon it wouldn't do no good and so he went on amumbling up stairs ,  and then we left .
he was a mighty nice old man .
and always is .
tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon ,  but he said we'd got to have it ;  so he took a think .
when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ;  then we went and waited around the spoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming ,  and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side ,  and i slid one of them up my sleeve ,  and tom says :  why ,  aunt sally ,  there ain't but nine spoons yet she says :  go 'long to your play ,  and don't bother me .
i know better ,  i counted 'm myself well ,  i've counted them twice ,  aunty ,  and i can't make but nine she looked out of all patience ,  but of course she come to countanybody would .
i declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine she says .
why ,  what in the worldplague take the things ,  i'll count 'm again so i slipped back the one i had ,  and when she got done counting ,  she says :  hang the troublesome rubbage ,  ther's ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both .
but tom says :  why ,  aunty ,  i don't think there's ten you numskull ,  didn't you see me count 'm i know ,  but well ,  i'll count 'm again so i smouched one ,  and they come out nine ,  same as the other time .
well ,  she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over ,  she was so mad .
but she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ;  and so ,  three times they come out right ,  and three times they come out wrong .
then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest ;  and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace ,  and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us .
so we had the odd spoon ,  and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was agiving us our sailing orders ,  and jim got it all right ,  along with her shingle nail ,  before noon .
we was very well satisfied with this business ,  and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took ,  because he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life ;  and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did ;  and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more .
so we put the sheet back on the line that night ,  and stole one out of her closet ;  and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more ,  and she didn't care ,  and warn't agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it ,  and wouldn't count them again not to save her life ;  she druther die first .
so we was all right now ,  as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles ,  by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup counting ;  and as to the candlestick ,  it warn't no consequence ,  it would blow over by and by .
but that pie was a job ;  we had no end of trouble with that pie .
we fixed it up away down in the woods ,  and cooked it there ;  and we got it done at last ,  and very satisfactory ,  too ;  but not all in one day ;  and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through ,  and we got burnt pretty much all over ,  in places ,  and eyes put out with the smoke ;  because ,  you see ,  we didn't want nothing but a crust ,  and we couldn't prop it up right ,  and she would always cave in .
but of course we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder ,  too ,  in the pie .
so then we laid in with jim the second night ,  and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together ,  and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with .
we let on it took nine months to make it .
and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods ,  but it wouldn't go into the pie .
being made of a whole sheet ,  that way ,  there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them ,  and plenty left over for soup ,  or sausage ,  or anything you choose .
we could a had a whole dinner .
but we didn't need it .
all we needed was just enough for the pie ,  and so we throwed the rest away .
we didn't cook none of the pies in the washpanafraid the solder would melt ;  but uncle silas he had a noble brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of ,  because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable ,  not on account of being any account ,  because they warn't ,  but on account of them being relicts ,  you know ,  and we snaked her out ,  private ,  and took her down there ,  but she failed on the first pies ,  because we didn't know how ,  but she come up smiling on the last one .
we took and lined her with dough ,  and set her in the coals ,  and loaded her up with rag rope ,  and put on a dough roof ,  and shut down the lid ,  and put hot embers on top ,  and stood off five foot ,  with the long handle ,  cool and comfortable ,  and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at .
but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along ,  for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business i don't know nothing what i'm talking about ,  and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time ,  too .
nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in jim's pan ;  and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ;  and so jim got everything all right ,  and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick ,  and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole .
making them pens was a distressid tough job ,  and so was the saw ;  and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all .
that's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall .
but he had to have it ;  tom said he'd got to ;  there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind ,  and his coat of arms .
look at lady jane grey ,  he says ;  look at gilford dudley ;  look at old northumberland !
why ,  huck ,  s'pose it is considerble troublewhat you going to dohow you going to get around it ?
jim's got to do his inscription and coat of arms .
they all do jim says :  why ,  mars tom ,  i hain't got no coat o' arm ;  i hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt ,  en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat oh ,  you don't understand ,  jim ;  a coat of arms is very different well ,  i says ,  jim's right ,  anyway ,  when he says he ain't got no coat of arms ,  because he hain't i reckon i knowed that ,  tom says ,  but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of thisbecause he's going out right ,  and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece ,  jim amaking his'n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon ,  tom set to work to think out the coat of arms .
by and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take ,  but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on .
he says :  on the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base ,  a saltire murrey in the fess ,  with a dog ,  couchant ,  for common charge ,  and under his foot a chain embattled ,  for slavery ,  with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed ,  and three invected lines on a field azure ,  with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ;  crest ,  a runaway nigger ,  sable ,  with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ;  and a couple of gules for supporters ,  which is you and me ;  motto ,  maggiore fretta ,  minore otto got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed geewhillikins ,  i says ,  but what does the rest of it mean we ain't got no time to bother over that ,  he says ;  we got to dig in like all gitout well ,  anyway ,  i says ,  what's some of it ?
what's a fess a fessa fess isyou don't need to know what a fess is .
i'll show him how to make it when he gets to it shucks ,  tom ,  i says ,  i think you might tell a person .
what's a bar sinister oh ,  i don't know .
but he's got to have it .
all the nobility does that was just his way .
if it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you ,  he wouldn't do it .
you might pump at him a week ,  it wouldn't make no difference .
he'd got all that coat of arms business fixed ,  so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work ,  which was to plan out a mournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one ,  like they all done .
he made up a lot ,  and wrote them out on a paper ,  and read them off ,  so :   .
here a captive heart busted .
 .
here a poor prisoner ,  forsook by the world and friends ,  fretted his sorrowful life .
 .
here a lonely heart broke ,  and a worn spirit went to its rest ,  after thirtyseven years of solitary captivity .
 .
here ,  homeless and friendless ,  after thirtyseven years of bitter captivity ,  perished a noble stranger ,  natural son of louis xiv .
tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them ,  and he most broke down .
when he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall ,  they was all so good ;  but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on .
jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail ,  and he didn't know how to make letters ,  besides ;  but tom said he would block them out for him ,  and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines .
then pretty soon he says :  come to think ,  the logs ain't agoing to do ;  they don't have log walls in a dungeon :  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock .
we'll fetch a rock jim said the rock was worse than the logs ;  he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out .
but tom said he would let me help him do it .
then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens .
it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow ,  and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores ,  and we didn't seem to make no headway ,  hardly ;  so tom says :  i know how to fix it .
we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions ,  and we can kill two birds with that same rock .
there's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill ,  and we'll smouch it ,  and carve the things on it ,  and file out the pens and the saw on it ,  too it warn't no slouch of an idea ;  and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ;  but we allowed we'd tackle it .
it warn't quite midnight yet ,  so we cleared out for the mill ,  leaving jim at work .
we smouched the grindstone ,  and set out to roll her home ,  but it was a most nation tough job .
sometimes ,  do what we could ,  we couldn't keep her from falling over ,  and she come mighty near mashing us every time .
tom said she was going to get one of us ,  sure ,  before we got through .
we got her half way ;  and then we was plumb played out ,  and most drownded with sweat .
we see it warn't no use ;  we got to go and fetch jim .
so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bedleg ,  and wrapt it round and round his neck ,  and we crawled out through our hole and down there ,  and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ;  and tom superintended .
he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see .
he knowed how to do everything .
our hole was pretty big ,  but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through ;  but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough .
then tom marked out them things on it with the nail ,  and set jim to work on them ,  with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the leanto for a hammer ,  and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him ,  and then he could go to bed ,  and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it .
then we helped him fix his chain back on the bedleg ,  and was ready for bed ourselves .
but tom thought of something ,  and says :  you got any spiders in here ,  jim no ,  sah ,  thanks to goodness i hain't ,  mars tom all right ,  we'll get you some but bless you ,  honey ,  i doan' want none .
i's afeard un um .
i jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun' tom thought a minute or two ,  and says :  it's a good idea .
and i reckon it's been done .
it must a been done ;  it stands to reason .
yes ,  it's a prime good idea .
where could you keep it keep what ,  mars tom why ,  a rattlesnake de goodness gracious alive ,  mars tom !
why ,  if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah i'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall ,  i would ,  wid my head why ,  jim ,  you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little .
you could tame it tame it yeseasy enough .
every animal is grateful for kindness and petting ,  and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them .
any book will tell you that .
you trythat's all i ask ;  just try for two or three days .
why ,  you can get him so ,  in a little while ,  that he'll love you ;  and sleep with you ;  and won't stay away from you a minute ;  and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth please ,  mars tomdoan' talk so !
i can't stan' it !
he'd let me shove his head in my mouffer a favor ,  hain't it ?
i lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' i ast him .
en mo' en dat ,  i doan' want him to sleep wid me jim ,  don't act so foolish .
a prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet ,  and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried ,  why ,  there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life why ,  mars tom ,  i doan' want no sich glory .
snake take 'n bite jim's chin off ,  den whah is de glory ?
no ,  sah ,  i doan' want no sich doin's blame it ,  can't you try ?
i only want you to tryyou needn't keep it up if it don't work but de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while i's a tryin' him .
mars tom ,  i's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable ,  but ef you en huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame ,  i's gwyne to leave ,  dat's shore well ,  then ,  let it go ,  let it go ,  if you're so bullheaded about it .
we can get you some gartersnakes ,  and you can tie some buttons on their tails ,  and let on they're rattlesnakes ,  and i reckon that 'll have to do i k'n stan' dem ,  mars tom ,  but blame' 'f i couldn' get along widout um ,  i tell you dat .
i never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner well ,  it always is when it's done right .
you got any rats around here no ,  sah ,  i hain't seed none well ,  we'll get you some rats why ,  mars tom ,  i doan' want no rats .
dey's de dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body ,  en rustle roun' over 'im ,  en bite his feet ,  when he's tryin' to sleep ,  i ever see .
no ,  sah ,  gimme g'yartersnakes ,  'f i's got to have 'm ,  but doan' gimme no rats ;  i hain' got no use f'r um ,  skasely but ,  jim ,  you got to have 'emthey all do .
so don't make no more fuss about it .
prisoners ain't ever without rats .
there ain't no instance of it .
and they train them ,  and pet them ,  and learn them tricks ,  and they get to be as sociable as flies .
but you got to play music to them .
you got anything to play music on i ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper ,  en a juiceharp ;  but i reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juiceharp yes they wouldthey don't care what kind of music 'tis .
a jewsharp's plenty good enough for a rat .
all animals like musicin a prison they dote on it .
specially ,  painful music ;  and you can't get no other kind out of a jewsharp .
it always interests them ;  they come out to see what's the matter with you .
yes ,  you're all right ;  you're fixed very well .
you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep ,  and early in the mornings ,  and play your jewsharp ;  play 'the last link is broken'that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else ;  and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats ,  and the snakes ,  and spiders ,  and things begin to feel worried about you ,  and come .
and they'll just fairly swarm over you ,  and have a noble good time yes ,  dey will ,  i reck'n ,  mars tom ,  but what kine er time is jim havin' ?
blest if i kin see de pint .
but i'll do it ef i got to .
i reck'n i better keep de animals satisfied ,  en not have no trouble in de house tom waited to think it over ,  and see if there wasn't nothing else ;  and pretty soon he says :  oh ,  there's one thing i forgot .
could you raise a flower here ,  do you reckon i doan know but maybe i could ,  mars tom ;  but it's tolable dark in heah ,  en i ain' got no use f'r no flower ,  nohow ,  en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble well ,  you try it ,  anyway .
some other prisoners has done it one er dem big cattaillookin' mullenstalks would grow in heah ,  mars tom ,  i reck'n ,  but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss don't you believe it .
we'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there ,  and raise it .
and don't call it mullen ,  call it pitchiolathat's its right name when it's in a prison .
and you want to water it with your tears why ,  i got plenty spring water ,  mars tom you don't want spring water ;  you want to water it with your tears .
it's the way they always do why ,  mars tom ,  i lay i kin raise one er dem mullenstalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a start'n one wid tears that ain't the idea .
you got to do it with tears she'll die on my han's ,  mars tom ,  she sholy will ;  kase i doan' skasely ever cry so tom was stumped .
but he studied it over ,  and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion .
he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one ,  private ,  in jim's coffeepot ,  in the morning .
jim said he would jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ;  and found so much fault with it ,  and with the work and bother of raising the mullen ,  and jewsharping the rats ,  and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things ,  on top of all the other work he had to do on pens ,  and inscriptions ,  and journals ,  and things ,  which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook ,  that tom most lost all patience with him ;  and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself ,  and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them ,  and they was just about wasted on him .
so jim he was sorry ,  and said he wouldn't behave so no more ,  and then me and tom shoved for bed .
in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down ,  and unstopped the best rathole ,  and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ;  and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sally's bed .
but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there ,  and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out ,  and they did ;  and aunt sally she come in ,  and when we got back she was astanding on top of the bed raising cain ,  and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her .
so she took and dusted us both with the hickry ,  and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen ,  drat that meddlesome cub ,  and they warn't the likeliest ,  nuther ,  because the first haul was the pick of the flock .
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was .
we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders ,  and bugs ,  and frogs ,  and caterpillars ,  and one thing or another ;  and we like to got a hornet's nest ,  but we didn't .
the family was at home .
we didn't give it right up ,  but stayed with them as long as we could ;  because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out ,  and they done it .
then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places ,  and was pretty near all right again ,  but couldn't set down convenient .
and so we went for the snakes ,  and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes ,  and put them in a bag ,  and put it in our room ,  and by that time it was suppertime ,  and a rattling good honest day's work :  and hungryoh ,  no ,  i reckon not !
and there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didn't half tie the sack ,  and they worked out somehow ,  and left .
but it didn't matter much ,  because they was still on the premises somewheres .
so we judged we could get some of them again .
no ,  there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell .
you'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ;  and they generly landed in your plate ,  or down the back of your neck ,  and most of the time where you didn't want them .
well ,  they was handsome and striped ,  and there warn't no harm in a million of them ;  but that never made no difference to aunt sally ;  she despised snakes ,  be the breed what they might ,  and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it ;  and every time one of them flopped down on her ,  it didn't make no difference what she was doing ,  she would just lay that work down and light out .
i never see such a woman .
and you could hear her whoop to jericho .
you couldn't get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs .
and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire .
she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created .
why ,  after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warn't over it yet ;  she warn't near over it ;  when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings .
it was very curious .
but tom said all women was just so .
he said they was made that way for some reason or other .
we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way ,  and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them .
i didn't mind the lickings ,  because they didn't amount to nothing ;  but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot .
but we got them laid in ,  and all the other things ;  and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him .
jim didn't like the spiders ,  and the spiders didn't like jim ;  and so they'd lay for him ,  and make it mighty warm for him .
and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him ,  skasely ;  and when there was ,  a body couldn't sleep ,  it was so lively ,  and it was always lively ,  he said ,  because they never all slept at one time ,  but took turn about ,  so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck ,  and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch ,  so he always had one gang under him ,  in his way ,  and t'other gang having a circus over him ,  and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over .
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again ,  not for a salary .
well ,  by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape .
the shirt was sent in early ,  in a pie ,  and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh ;  the pens was made ,  the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone ;  the bedleg was sawed in two ,  and we had et up the sawdust ,  and it give us a most amazing stomachache .
we reckoned we was all going to die ,  but didn't .
it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see ;  and tom said the same .
but as i was saying ,  we'd got all the work done now ,  at last ;  and we was all pretty much fagged out ,  too ,  but mainly jim .
the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger ,  but hadn't got no answer ,  because there warn't no such plantation ;  so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st .
louis and new orleans papers ;  and when he mentioned the st .
louis ones it give me the cold shivers ,  and i see we hadn't no time to lose .
so tom said ,  now for the nonnamous letters .
what's them i says .
warnings to the people that something is up .
sometimes it's done one way ,  sometimes another .
but there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle .
when louis xvi .
was going to light out of the tooleries ,  a servantgirl done it .
it's a very good way ,  and so is the nonnamous letters .
we'll use them both .
and it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him ,  and she stays in ,  and he slides out in her clothes .
we'll do that ,  too but looky here ,  tom ,  what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up ?
let them find it out for themselvesit's their lookout yes ,  i know ;  but you can't depend on them .
it's the way they've acted from the very startleft us to do everything .
they're so confiding and mulletheaded they don't take notice of nothing at all .
so if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us ,  and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat ;  won't amount to nothingwon't be nothing to it well ,  as for me ,  tom ,  that's the way i'd like shucks he says ,  and looked disgusted .
so i says :  but i ain't going to make no complaint .
any way that suits you suits me .
what you going to do about the servantgirl you'll be her .
you slide in ,  in the middle of the night ,  and hook that yaller girl's frock why ,  tom ,  that 'll make trouble next morning ;  because ,  of course ,  she prob'bly hain't got any but that one i know ;  but you don't want it but fifteen minutes ,  to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door all right ,  then ,  i'll do it ;  but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldn't look like a servantgirl then ,  would you no ,  but there won't be nobody to see what i look like ,  anyway that ain't got nothing to do with it .
the thing for us to do is just to do our duty ,  and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not .
hain't you got no principle at all all right ,  i ain't saying nothing ;  i'm the servantgirl .
who's jim's mother i'm his mother .
i'll hook a gown from aunt sally well ,  then ,  you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves not much .
i'll stuff jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise ,  and jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it ,  and we'll all evade together .
when a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion .
it's always called so when a king escapes ,  f'rinstance .
and the same with a king's son ;  it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter ,  and i smouched the yaller wench's frock that night ,  and put it on ,  and shoved it under the front door ,  the way tom told me to .
it said :  beware .
trouble is brewing .
keep a sharp lookout .
unknown friend .
next night we stuck a picture ,  which tom drawed in blood ,  of a skull and crossbones on the front door ;  and next night another one of a coffin on the back door .
i never see a family in such a sweat .
they couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air .
if a door banged ,  aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell ,  she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her ,  when she warn't noticing ,  she done the same ;  she couldn't face noway and be satisfied ,  because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was always awhirling around sudden ,  and saying ouch ,  and before she'd got twothirds around she'd whirl back again ,  and say it again ;  and she was afraid to go to bed ,  but she dasn't set up .
so the thing was working very well ,  tom said ;  he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory .
he said it showed it was done right .
so he said ,  now for the grand bulge !
so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready ,  and was wondering what we better do with it ,  because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night .
tom he went down the lightningrod to spy around ;  and the nigger at the back door was asleep ,  and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back .
this letter said :  don't betray me ,  i wish to be your friend .
there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight ,  and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them .
i am one of the gang ,  but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again ,  and will betray the helish design .
they will sneak down from northards ,  along the fence ,  at midnight exact ,  with a false key ,  and go in the nigger's cabin to get him .
i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger ;  but stead of that i will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ;  then whilst they are getting his chains loose ,  you slip there and lock them in ,  and can kill them at your leasure .
don't do anything but just the way i am telling you ,  if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo .
i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing .
unknown friend we was feeling pretty good after breakfast ,  and took my canoe and went over the river afishing ,  with a lunch ,  and had a good time ,  and took a look at the raft and found her all right ,  and got home late to supper ,  and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on ,  and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper ,  and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was ,  and never let on a word about the new letter ,  but didn't need to ,  because we knowed as much about it as anybody did ,  and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed ,  and got up about halfpast eleven ,  and tom put on aunt sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch ,  but says :  where's the butter i laid out a hunk of it ,  i says ,  on a piece of a cornpone well ,  you left it laid out ,  thenit ain't here we can get along without it ,  i says .
we can get along with it ,  too ,  he says ;  just you slide down cellar and fetch it .
and then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along .
i'll go and stuff the straw into jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise ,  and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there so out he went ,  and down cellar went i .
the hunk of butter ,  big as a person's fist ,  was where i had left it ,  so i took up the slab of cornpone with it on ,  and blowed out my light ,  and started up stairs very stealthy ,  and got up to the main floor all right ,  but here comes aunt sally with a candle ,  and i clapped the truck in my hat ,  and clapped my hat on my head ,  and the next second she see me ;  and she says :  you been down cellar yes'm what you been doing down there noth'n noth'n no'm well ,  then ,  what possessed you to go down there this time of night i don't know 'm you don't know ?
don't answer me that way .
tom ,  i want to know what you been doing down there i hain't been doing a single thing ,  aunt sally ,  i hope to gracious if i have i reckoned she'd let me go now ,  and as a generl thing she would ;  but i s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yardstick straight ;  so she says ,  very decided :  you just march into that settingroom and stay there till i come .
you been up to something you no business to ,  and i lay i'll find out what it is before i'm done with you so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the settingroom .
my ,  but there was a crowd there !
fifteen farmers ,  and every one of them had a gun .
i was most powerful sick ,  and slunk to a chair and set down .
they was setting around ,  some of them talking a little ,  in a low voice ,  and all of them fidgety and uneasy ,  but trying to look like they warn't ;  but i knowed they was ,  because they was always taking off their hats ,  and putting them on ,  and scratching their heads ,  and changing their seats ,  and fumbling with their buttons .
i warn't easy myself ,  but i didn't take my hat off ,  all the same .
i did wish aunt sally would come ,  and get done with me ,  and lick me ,  if she wanted to ,  and let me get away and tell tom how we'd overdone this thing ,  and what a thundering hornet'snest we'd got ourselves into ,  so we could stop fooling around straight off ,  and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us .
at last she come and begun to ask me questions ,  but i couldn't answer them straight ,  i didn't know which end of me was up ;  because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes ,  and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight ;  and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheepsignal ;  and here was aunty pegging away at the questions ,  and me ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared ;  and the place getting hotter and hotter ,  and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears ;  and pretty soon ,  when one of them says ,  i'm for going and getting in the cabin first and right now ,  and catching them when they come ,  i most dropped ;  and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead ,  and aunt sally she see it ,  and turns white as a sheet ,  and says :  for the land's sake ,  what is the matter with the child ?
he's got the brainfever as shore as you're born ,  and they're oozing out and everybody runs to see ,  and she snatches off my hat ,  and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter ,  and she grabbed me ,  and hugged me ,  and says :  oh ,  what a turn you did give me !
and how glad and grateful i am it ain't no worse ;  for luck's against us ,  and it never rains but it pours ,  and when i see that truck i thought we'd lost you ,  for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be ifdear ,  dear ,  whyd'nt you tell me that was what you'd been down there for ,  i wouldn't a cared .
now cler out to bed ,  and don't lemme see no more of you till morning i was up stairs in a second ,  and down the lightningrod in another one ,  and shinning through the dark for the leanto .
i couldn't hardly get my words out ,  i was so anxious ;  but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now ,  and not a minute to losethe house full of men ,  yonder ,  with guns !
his eyes just blazed ;  and he says :  nois that so ?
ain't it bully !
why ,  huck ,  if it was to do over again ,  i bet i could fetch two hundred !
if we could put it off till hurry !
hurry i says .
where's jim right at your elbow ;  if you reach out your arm you can touch him .
he's dressed ,  and everything's ready .
now we'll slide out and give the sheepsignal but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door ,  and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock ,  and heard a man say :  i told you we'd be too soon ;  they haven't comethe door is locked .
here ,  i'll lock some of you into the cabin ,  and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come ;  and the rest scatter around a piece ,  and listen if you can hear 'em coming so in they come ,  but couldn't see us in the dark ,  and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed .
but we got under all right ,  and out through the hole ,  swift but softjim first ,  me next ,  and tom last ,  which was according to tom's orders .
now we was in the leanto ,  and heard trampings close by outside .
so we crept to the door ,  and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack ,  but couldn't make out nothing ,  it was so dark ;  and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further ,  and when he nudged us jim must glide out first ,  and him last .
so he set his ear to the crack and listened ,  and listened ,  and listened ,  and the steps ascraping around out there all the time ;  and at last he nudged us ,  and we slid out ,  and stooped down ,  not breathing ,  and not making the least noise ,  and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file ,  and got to it all right ,  and me and jim over it ;  but tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail ,  and then he hear the steps coming ,  so he had to pull loose ,  which snapped the splinter and made a noise ;  and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out :  who's that ?
answer ,  or i'll shoot but we didn't answer ;  we just unfurled our heels and shoved .
then there was a rush ,  and a bang ,  bang ,  bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us !
we heard them sing out :  here they are !
they've broke for the river !
after 'em ,  boys ,  and turn loose the dogs so here they come ,  full tilt .
we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled ,  but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell .
we was in the path to the mill ;  and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by ,  and then dropped in behind them .
they'd had all the dogs shut up ,  so they wouldn't scare off the robbers ;  but by this time somebody had let them loose ,  and here they come ,  making powwow enough for a million ;  but they was our dogs ;  so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up ;  and when they see it warn't nobody but us ,  and no excitement to offer them ,  they only just said howdy ,  and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering ;  and then we upsteam again ,  and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill ,  and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied ,  and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river ,  but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to .
then we struck out ,  easy and comfortable ,  for the island where my raft was ;  and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank ,  till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out .
and when we stepped on to the raft i says :  now ,  old jim ,  you're a free man again ,  and i bet you won't ever be a slave no more en a mighty good job it wuz ,  too ,  huck .
it 'uz planned beautiful ,  en it 'uz done beautiful ;  en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be ,  but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg .
when me and jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before .
it was hurting him considerable ,  and bleeding ;  so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him ,  but he says :  gimme the rags ;  i can do it myself .
don't stop now ;  don't fool around here ,  and the evasion booming along so handsome ;  man the sweeps ,  and set her loose !
boys ,  we done it elegant'deed we did .
i wish we'd a had the handling of louis xvi ,  there wouldn't a been no 'son of saint louis ,  ascend to heaven' wrote down in his biography ;  no ,  sir ,  we'd a whooped him over the borderthat's what we'd a done with himand done it just as slick as nothing at all ,  too .
man the sweepsman the sweeps but me and jim was consultingand thinking .
and after we'd thought a minute ,  i says :  say it ,  jim so he says :  well ,  den ,  dis is de way it look to me ,  huck .
ef it wuz him dat 'uz bein' sot free ,  en one er de boys wuz to git shot ,  would he say ,  'go on en save me ,  nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one' is dat like mars tom sawyer ?
would he say dat ?
you bet he wouldn't !
well ,  den ,  is jim gywne to say it ?
no ,  sahi doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a doctor ,  not if it's forty year i knowed he was white inside ,  and i reckoned he'd say what he did sayso it was all right now ,  and i told tom i was agoing for a doctor .
he raised considerable row about it ,  but me and jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge ;  so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ;  but we wouldn't let him .
then he give us a piece of his mind ,  but it didn't do no good .
so when he sees me getting the canoe ready ,  he says :  well ,  then ,  if you're bound to go ,  i'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village .
shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast ,  and make him swear to be silent as the grave ,  and put a purse full of gold in his hand ,  and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark ,  and then fetch him here in the canoe ,  in a roundabout way amongst the islands ,  and search him and take his chalk away from him ,  and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village ,  or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again .
it's the way they all do so i said i would ,  and left ,  and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again .
the doctor was an old man ;  a very nice ,  kindlooking old man when i got him up .
i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon ,  and camped on a piece of a raft we found ,  and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams ,  for it went off and shot him in the leg ,  and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it ,  nor let anybody know ,  because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks .
who is your folks he says .
the phelpses ,  down yonder oh ,  he says .
and after a minute ,  he says :  how'd you say he got shot he had a dream ,  i says ,  and it shot him singular dream ,  he says .
so he lit up his lantern ,  and got his saddlebags ,  and we started .
but when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one ,  but didn't look pretty safe for two .
i says :  oh ,  you needn't be afeard ,  sir ,  she carried the three of us easy enough what three why ,  me and sid ,  andandand the guns ;  that's what i mean oh ,  he says .
but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her ,  and shook his head ,  and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one .
but they was all locked and chained ;  so he took my canoe ,  and said for me to wait till he come back ,  or i could hunt around further ,  or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to .
but i said i didn't ;  so i told him just how to find the raft ,  and then he started .
i struck an idea pretty soon .
i says to myself ,  spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail ,  as the saying is ?
spos'n it takes him three or four days ?
what are we going to dolay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag ?
no ,  sir ;  i know what i'll do .
i'll wait ,  and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more i'll get down there ,  too ,  if i swim ;  and we'll take and tie him ,  and keep him ,  and shove out down the river ;  and when tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth ,  or all we got ,  and then let him get ashore .
so then i crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep ;  and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head !
i shot out and went for the doctor's house ,  but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other ,  and warn't back yet .
well ,  thinks i ,  that looks powerful bad for tom ,  and i'll dig out for the island right off .
so away i shoved ,  and turned the corner ,  and nearly rammed my head into uncle silas's stomach !
he says :  why ,  tom where you been all this time ,  you rascal i hain't been nowheres ,  i says ,  only just hunting for the runaway niggerme and sid why ,  where ever did you go he says .
your aunt's been mighty uneasy she needn't ,  i says ,  because we was all right .
we followed the men and the dogs ,  but they outrun us ,  and we lost them ;  but we thought we heard them on the water ,  so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over ,  but couldn't find nothing of them ;  so we cruised along upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out ;  and tied up the canoe and went to sleep ,  and never waked up till about an hour ago ;  then we paddled over here to hear the news ,  and sid's at the postoffice to see what he can hear ,  and i'm abranching out to get something to eat for us ,  and then we're going home so then we went to the postoffice to get sid ;  but just as i suspicioned ,  he warn't there ;  so the old man he got a letter out of the office ,  and we waited awhile longer ,  but sid didn't come ;  so the old man said ,  come along ,  let sid foot it home ,  or canoe it ,  when he got done fooling aroundbut we would ride .
i couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for sid ;  and he said there warn't no use in it ,  and i must come along ,  and let aunt sally see we was all right .
when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both ,  and hugged me ,  and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks ,  and said she'd serve sid the same when he come .
and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives ,  to dinner ;  and such another clack a body never heard .
old mrs. hotchkiss was the worst ;  her tongue was agoing all the time .
she says :  well ,  sister phelps ,  i've ransacked thatair cabin over ,  an' i b'lieve the nigger was crazy .
i says to sister damrelldidn't i ,  sister damrells'i ,  he's crazy ,  s'ithem's the very words i said .
you all hearn me :  he's crazy ,  s'i ;  everything shows it ,  s'i .
look at thatair grindstone ,  s'i ;  want to tell me't any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone ,  s'i ?
here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart ;  'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirtyseven year ,  'n' all thatnatcherl son o' louis somebody ,  'n' sich everlast'n rubbage .
he's plumb crazy ,  s'i ;  it's what i says in the fust place ,  it's what i says in the middle ,  'n' it's what i says last 'n' all the timethe nigger's crazycrazy 's nebokoodneezer ,  s'i an' look at thatair ladder made out'n rags ,  sister hotchkiss ,  says old mrs. damrell ;  what in the name o' goodness could he ever want of the very words i was asayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to sister utterback ,  'n' she'll tell you so herself .
shshe ,  look at thatair rag ladder ,  shshe ;  'n' s'i ,  yes ,  look at it ,  s'iwhat could he awanted of it ,  s'i .
shshe ,  sister hotchkiss ,  shshe but how in the nation'd they ever git that grindstone in there ,  anyway ?
'n' who dug thatair hole ?
'n' who my very words ,  brer penrod !
i was asayin'pass thatair sasser o' m'lasses ,  won't yei was asayin' to sister dunlap ,  jist this minute ,  how did they git that grindstone in there ,  s'i .
without help ,  mind you'thout help !
that's wher 'tis .
don't tell me ,  s'i ;  there wuz help ,  s'i ;  'n' ther' wuz a plenty help ,  too ,  s'i ;  ther's ben a dozen ahelpin' that nigger ,  'n' i lay i'd skin every last nigger on this place but i'd find out who done it ,  s'i ;  'n' moreover ,  s'i a dozen says youforty couldn't a done every thing that's been done .
look at them caseknife saws and things ,  how tedious they've been made ;  look at that bedleg sawed off with 'm ,  a week's work for six men ;  look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed ;  and look at you may well say it ,  brer hightower !
it's jist as i was asayin' to brer phelps ,  his own self .
s'e ,  what do you think of it ,  sister hotchkiss ,  s'e ?
think o' what ,  brer phelps ,  s'i ?
think o' that bedleg sawed off that a way ,  s'e ?
think of it ,  s'i ?
i lay it never sawed itself off ,  s'isomebody sawed it ,  s'i ;  that's my opinion ,  take it or leave it ,  it mayn't be no 'count ,  s'i ,  but sich as 't is ,  it's my opinion ,  s'i ,  'n' if any body k'n start a better one ,  s'i ,  let him do it ,  s'i ,  that's all .
i says to sister dunlap ,  s'i why ,  dog my cats ,  they must a ben a housefull o' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work ,  sister phelps .
look at that shirtevery last inch of it kivered over with secret african writ'n done with blood !
must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along ,  all the time ,  amost .
why ,  i'd give two dollars to have it read to me ;  'n' as for the niggers that wrote it ,  i 'low i'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll people to help him ,  brother marples !
well ,  i reckon you'd think so if you'd a been in this house for a while back .
why ,  they've stole everything they could lay their hands onand we awatching all the time ,  mind you .
they stole that shirt right off o' the line !
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of ,  ther' ain't no telling how many times they didn't steal that ;  and flour ,  and candles ,  and candlesticks ,  and spoons ,  and the old warmingpan ,  and most a thousand things that i disremember now ,  and my new calico dress ;  and me and silas and my sid and tom on the constant watch day and night ,  as i was atelling you ,  and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them ;  and here at the last minute ,  lo and behold you ,  they slides right in under our noses and fools us ,  and not only fools us but the injun territory robbers too ,  and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound ,  and that with sixteen men and twentytwo dogs right on their very heels at that very time !
i tell you ,  it just bangs anything i ever heard of .
why ,  sperits couldn't a done better and been no smarter .
and i reckon they must a been speritsbecause ,  you know our dogs ,  and ther' ain't no better ;  well ,  them dogs never even got on the track of 'm once !
you explain that to me if you canany of you well ,  it does beat laws alive ,  i never so help me ,  i wouldn't a be housethieves as well as goodnessgracioussakes ,  i'd a ben afeard to live in sich a 'fraid to livewhy ,  i was that scared i dasn't hardly go to bed ,  or get up ,  or lay down ,  or set down ,  sister ridgeway .
why ,  they'd steal the verywhy ,  goodness sakes ,  you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night .
i hope to gracious if i warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family !
i was just to that pass i didn't have no reasoning faculties no more .
it looks foolish enough now ,  in the daytime ;  but i says to myself ,  there's my two poor boys asleep ,  'way up stairs in that lonesome room ,  and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy 't i crep' up there and locked 'em in !
i did .
and anybody would .
because ,  you know ,  when you get scared that way ,  and it keeps running on ,  and getting worse and worse all the time ,  and your wits gets to addling ,  and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things ,  and by and by you think to yourself ,  spos'n i was a boy ,  and was away up there ,  and the door ain't locked ,  and you she stopped ,  looking kind of wondering ,  and then she turned her head around slow ,  and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk .
says i to myself ,  i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little .
so i done it .
but i dasn't go fur ,  or she'd a sent for me .
and when it was late in the day the people all went ,  and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid ,  and the door was locked ,  and we wanted to see the fun ,  so we went down the lightningrod ,  and both of us got hurt a little ,  and we didn't never want to try that no more .
and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before ;  and then she said she'd forgive us ,  and maybe it was all right enough anyway ,  and about what a body might expect of boys ,  for all boys was a pretty harumscarum lot as fur as she could see ;  and so ,  as long as no harm hadn't come of it ,  she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still ,  stead of fretting over what was past and done .
so then she kissed me ,  and patted me on the head ,  and dropped into a kind of a brown study ;  and pretty soon jumps up ,  and says :  why ,  lawsamercy ,  it's most night ,  and sid not come yet !
what has become of that boy i see my chance ;  so i skips up and says :  i'll run right up to town and get him ,  i says .
no you won't ,  she says .
you'll stay right wher' you are ;  one's enough to be lost at a time .
if he ain't here to supper ,  your uncle 'll go well ,  he warn't there to supper ;  so right after supper uncle went .
he come back about ten a little bit uneasy ;  hadn't run across tom's track .
aunt sally was a good deal uneasy ;  but uncle silas he said there warn't no occasion to beboys will be boys ,  he said ,  and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right .
so she had to be satisfied .
but she said she'd set up for him a while anyway ,  and keep a light burning so he could see it .
and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle ,  and tucked me in ,  and mothered me so good i felt mean ,  and like i couldn't look her in the face ;  and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time ,  and said what a splendid boy sid was ,  and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him ;  and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost ,  or hurt ,  or maybe drownded ,  and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead ,  and she not by him to help him ,  and so the tears would drip down silent ,  and i would tell her that sid was all right ,  and would be home in the morning ,  sure ;  and she would squeeze my hand ,  or maybe kiss me ,  and tell me to say it again ,  and keep on saying it ,  because it done her good ,  and she was in so much trouble .
and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle ,  and says :  the door ain't going to be locked ,  tom ,  and there's the window and the rod ;  but you'll be good ,  won't you ?
and you won't go ?
for my sake laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom ,  and was all intending to go ;  but after that i wouldn't a went ,  not for kingdoms .
but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind ,  so i slept very restless .
and twice i went down the rod away in the night ,  and slipped around front ,  and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them ;  and i wished i could do something for her ,  but i couldn't ,  only to swear that i wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more .
and the third time i waked up at dawn ,  and slid down ,  and she was there yet ,  and her candle was most out ,  and her old gray head was resting on her hand ,  and she was asleep .
the old man was uptown again before breakfast ,  but couldn't get no track of tom ;  and both of them set at the table thinking ,  and not saying nothing ,  and looking mournful ,  and their coffee getting cold ,  and not eating anything .
and by and by the old man says :  did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the postoffice no ,  you didn't give me no letter well ,  i must a forgot it so he rummaged his pockets ,  and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down ,  and fetched it ,  and give it to her .
she says :  why ,  it's from st .
petersburgit's from sis i allowed another walk would do me good ;  but i couldn't stir .
but before she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something .
and so did i .
it was tom sawyer on a mattress ;  and that old doctor ;  and jim ,  in her calico dress ,  with his hands tied behind him ;  and a lot of people .
i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy ,  and rushed .
she flung herself at tom ,  crying ,  and says :  oh ,  he's dead ,  he's dead ,  i know he's dead and tom he turned his head a little ,  and muttered something or other ,  which showed he warn't in his right mind ;  then she flung up her hands ,  and says :  he's alive ,  thank god !
and that's enough and she snatched a kiss of him ,  and flew for the house to get the bed ready ,  and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else ,  as fast as her tongue could go ,  every jump of the way .
i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim ;  and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house .
the men was very huffy ,  and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there ,  so they wouldn't be trying to run away like jim done ,  and making such a raft of trouble ,  and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights .
but the others said ,  don't do it ,  it wouldn't answer at all ;  he ain't our nigger ,  and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him ,  sure .
so that cooled them down a little ,  because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him .
they cussed jim considerble ,  though ,  and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while ,  but jim never said nothing ,  and he never let on to know me ,  and they took him to the same cabin ,  and put his own clothes on him ,  and chained him again ,  and not to no bedleg this time ,  but to a big staple drove into the bottom log ,  and chained his hands ,  too ,  and both legs ,  and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come ,  or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time ,  and filled up our hole ,  and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night ,  and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ;  and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl goodbye cussing ,  and then the old doctor comes and takes a look ,  and says :  don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to ,  because he ain't a bad nigger .
when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldn't cut the bullet out without some help ,  and he warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help ;  and he got a little worse and a little worse ,  and after a long time he went out of his head ,  and wouldn't let me come anigh him any more ,  and said if i chalked his raft he'd kill me ,  and no end of wild foolishness like that ,  and i see i couldn't do anything at all with him ;  so i says ,  i got to have help somehow ;  and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help ,  and he done it ,  too ,  and done it very well .
of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger ,  and there i was !
and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night .
it was a fix ,  i tell you !
i had a couple of patients with the chills ,  and of course i'd of liked to run up to town and see them ,  but i dasn't ,  because the nigger might get away ,  and then i'd be to blame ;  and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail .
so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning ;  and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller ,  and yet he was risking his freedom to do it ,  and was all tired out ,  too ,  and i see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately .
i liked the nigger for that ;  i tell you ,  gentlemen ,  a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment ,  too .
i had everything i needed ,  and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter ,  maybe ,  because it was so quiet ;  but there i was ,  with both of 'm on my hands ,  and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning ;  then some men in a skiff come by ,  and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ;  so i motioned them in quiet ,  and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about ,  and we never had no trouble .
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep ,  too ,  we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on ,  and towed her over very nice and quiet ,  and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start .
he ain't no bad nigger ,  gentlemen ;  that's what i think about him somebody says :  well ,  it sounds very good ,  doctor ,  i'm obleeged to say then the others softened up a little ,  too ,  and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn ;  and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him ,  too ;  because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him .
then they all agreed that jim had acted very well ,  and was deserving to have some notice took of it ,  and reward .
so every one of them promised ,  right out and hearty ,  that they wouldn't cuss him no more .
then they come out and locked him up .
i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off ,  because they was rotten heavy ,  or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ;  but they didn't think of it ,  and i reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in ,  but i judged i'd get the doctor's yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as i'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of meexplanations ,  i mean ,  of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger .
but i had plenty time .
aunt sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night ,  and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him .
next morning i heard tom was a good deal better ,  and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap .
so i slips to the sickroom ,  and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash .
but he was sleeping ,  and sleeping very peaceful ,  too ;  and pale ,  not firefaced the way he was when he come .
so i set down and laid for him to wake .
in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in ,  and there i was ,  up a stump again !
she motioned me to be still ,  and set down by me ,  and begun to whisper ,  and said we could all be joyful now ,  because all the symptoms was firstrate ,  and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long ,  and looking better and peacefuller all the time ,  and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind .
so we set there watching ,  and by and by he stirs a bit ,  and opened his eyes very natural ,  and takes a look ,  and says :  hellowhy ,  i'm at home !
how's that ?
where's the raft it's all right ,  i says .
and jim the same ,  i says ,  but couldn't say it pretty brash .
but he never noticed ,  but says :  good !
splendid !
now we're all right and safe !
did you tell aunty i was going to say yes ;  but she chipped in and says :  about what ,  sid why ,  about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why ,  the whole thing .
there ain't but one ;  how we set the runaway nigger freeme and tom good land !
set the runwhat is the child talking about !
dear ,  dear ,  out of his head again no ,  i ain't out of my head ;  i know all what i'm talking about .
we did set him freeme and tom .
we laid out to do it ,  and we done it .
and we done it elegant ,  too he'd got a start ,  and she never checked him up ,  just set and stared and stared ,  and let him clip along ,  and i see it warn't no use for me to put in .
why ,  aunty ,  it cost us a power of workweeks of ithours and hours ,  every night ,  whilst you was all asleep .
and we had to steal candles ,  and the sheet ,  and the shirt ,  and your dress ,  and spoons ,  and tin plates ,  and caseknives ,  and the warmingpan ,  and the grindstone ,  and flour ,  and just no end of things ,  and you can't think what work it was to make the saws ,  and pens ,  and inscriptions ,  and one thing or another ,  and you can't think half the fun it was .
and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things ,  and nonnamous letters from the robbers ,  and get up and down the lightningrod ,  and dig the hole into the cabin ,  and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie ,  and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on ,  for company for jim ;  and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business ,  because the men come before we was out of the cabin ,  and we had to rush ,  and they heard us and let drive at us ,  and i got my share ,  and we dodged out of the path and let them go by ,  and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us ,  but went for the most noise ,  and we got our canoe ,  and made for the raft ,  and was all safe ,  and jim was a free man ,  and we done it all by ourselves ,  and wasn't it bully ,  aunty well ,  i never heard the likes of it in all my born days !
so it was you ,  you little rapscallions ,  that's been making all this trouble ,  and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death .
i've as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute .
to think ,  here i've been ,  night after night ,  ayou just get well once ,  you young scamp ,  and i lay i'll tan the old harry out o' both o' ye but tom ,  he was so proud and joyful ,  he just couldn't hold in ,  and his tongue just went itshe achipping in ,  and spitting fire all along ,  and both of them going it at once ,  like a cat convention ;  and she says :  well ,  you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now ,  for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who tom says ,  dropping his smile and looking surprised .
with who ?
why ,  the runaway nigger ,  of course .
who'd you reckon tom looks at me very grave ,  and says :  tom ,  didn't you just tell me he was all right ?
hasn't he got away him says aunt sally ;  the runaway nigger ?
'deed he hasn't .
they've got him back ,  safe and sound ,  and he's in that cabin again ,  on bread and water ,  and loaded down with chains ,  till he's claimed or sold tom rose square up in bed ,  with his eye hot ,  and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills ,  and sings out to me :  they hain't no right to shut him up !
shoveand don't you lose a minute .
turn him loose !
he ain't no slave ;  he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth what does the child mean i mean every word i say ,  aunt sally ,  and if somebody don't go ,  i'll go .
i've knowed him all his life ,  and so has tom ,  there .
old miss watson died two months ago ,  and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river ,  and said so ;  and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for ,  seeing he was already free well ,  that is a question ,  i must say ;  and just like women !
why ,  i wanted the adventure of it ;  and i'd a waded neckdeep in blood togoodness alive ,  aunt polly if she warn't standing right there ,  just inside the door ,  looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie ,  i wish i may never !
aunt sally jumped for her ,  and most hugged the head off of her ,  and cried over her ,  and i found a good enough place for me under the bed ,  for it was getting pretty sultry for us ,  seemed to me .
and i peeped out ,  and in a little while tom's aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the earth ,  you know .
and then she says :  yes ,  you better turn y'r head awayi would if i was you ,  tom oh ,  deary me says aunt sally ;  is he changed so ?
why ,  that ain't tom ,  it's sid ;  tom'stom'swhy ,  where is tom ?
he was here a minute ago you mean where's huck finnthat's what you mean !
i reckon i hain't raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him .
that would be a pretty howdydo .
come out from under that bed ,  huck finn so i done it .
but not feeling brash .
aunt sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons i ever seeexcept one ,  and that was uncle silas ,  when he come in and they told it all to him .
it kind of made him drunk ,  as you may say ,  and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day ,  and preached a prayermeeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation ,  because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it .
so tom's aunt polly ,  she told all about who i was ,  and what ;  and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs. phelps took me for tom sawyershe chipped in and says ,  oh ,  go on and call me aunt sally ,  i'm used to it now ,  and 'tain't no need to changethat when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itthere warn't no other way ,  and i knowed he wouldn't mind ,  because it would be nuts for him ,  being a mystery ,  and he'd make an adventure out of it ,  and be perfectly satisfied .
and so it turned out ,  and he let on to be sid ,  and made things as soft as he could for me .
and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will ;  and so ,  sure enough ,  tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free !
and i couldn't ever understand before ,  until that minute and that talk ,  how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup .
well ,  aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe ,  she says to herself :  look at that ,  now !
i might have expected it ,  letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him .
so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river ,  eleven hundred mile ,  and find out what that creetur's up to this time ,  as long as i couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it why ,  i never heard nothing from you ,  says aunt sally .
well ,  i wonder !
why ,  i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here well ,  i never got 'em ,  sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe ,  and says :  you ,  tom wellwhat he says ,  kind of pettish .
don't you what me ,  you impudent thinghand out them letters what letters them letters .
i be bound ,  if i have to take aholt of you i'll they're in the trunk .
there ,  now .
and they're just the same as they was when i got them out of the office .
i hain't looked into them ,  i hain't touched them .
but i knowed they'd make trouble ,  and i thought if you warn't in no hurry ,  i'd well ,  you do need skinning ,  there ain't no mistake about it .
and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming ;  and i s'pose he no ,  it come yesterday ;  i hain't read it yet ,  but it's all right ,  i've got that one i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't ,  but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to .
so i never said nothing .
the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea ,  time of the evasionwhat it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before ?
and he said ,  what he had planned in his head from the start ,  if we got jim out all safe ,  was for us to run him down the river on the raft ,  and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river ,  and then tell him about his being free ,  and take him back up home on a steamboat ,  in style ,  and pay him for his lost time ,  and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around ,  and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brassband ,  and then he would be a hero ,  and so would we .
but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was .
we had jim out of the chains in no time ,  and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom ,  they made a heap of fuss over him ,  and fixed him up prime ,  and give him all he wanted to eat ,  and a good time ,  and nothing to do .
and we had him up to the sickroom ,  and had a high talk ;  and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient ,  and doing it up so good ,  and jim was pleased most to death ,  and busted out ,  and says :  dah ,  now ,  huck ,  what i tell youwhat i tell you up dah on jackson islan' ?
i tole you i got a hairy breas' ,  en what's de sign un it ;  en i tole you i ben rich wunst ,  en gwineter to be rich agin ;  en it's come true ;  en heah she is !
dah ,  now !
doan' talk to mesigns is signs ,  mine i tell you ;  en i knowed jis' 's well 'at i 'uz gwineter be rich agin as i's astannin' heah dis minute and then tom he talked along and talked along ,  and says ,  le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit ,  and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns ,  over in the territory ,  for a couple of weeks or two ;  and i says ,  all right ,  that suits me ,  but i ain't got no money for to buy the outfit ,  and i reckon i couldn't get none from home ,  because it's likely pap's been back before now ,  and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up .
no ,  he hain't ,  tom says ;  it's all there yetsix thousand dollars and more ;  and your pap hain't ever been back since .
hadn't when i come away ,  anyhow jim says ,  kind of solemn :  he ain't acomin' back no mo' ,  huck i says :  why ,  jim nemmine why ,  huckbut he ain't comin' back no mo but i kept at him ;  so at last he says :  doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river ,  en dey wuz a man in dah ,  kivered up ,  en i went in en unkivered him and didn' let you come in ?
well ,  den ,  you kin git yo' money when you wants it ,  kase dat wuz him tom's most well now ,  and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard for a watch ,  and is always seeing what time it is ,  and so there ain't nothing more to write about ,  and i am rotten glad of it ,  because if i'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldn't a tackled it ,  and ain't agoing to no more .
but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest ,  because aunt sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me ,  and i can't stand it .
i been there before .
the end .
yours truly ,  huck finn .
it is a truth universally acknowledged ,  that a single man in possession of a good fortune ,  must be in want of a wife .
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood ,  this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families ,  that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
my dear mr. bennet ,  said his lady to him one day ,  have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr. bennet replied that he had not .
but it is ,  returned she ;  for mrs. long has just been here ,  and she told me all about it mr. bennet made no answer .
do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently .
you want to tell me ,  and i have no objection to hearing it this was invitation enough .
why ,  my dear ,  you must know ,  mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ;  that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place ,  and was so much delighted with it ,  that he agreed with mr. morris immediately ;  that he is to take possession before michaelmas ,  and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh !
single ,  my dear ,  to be sure !
a single man of large fortune ;  four or five thousand a year .
what a fine thing for our girls how so ?
how can it affect them my dear mr. bennet ,  replied his wife ,  how can you be so tiresome !
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them is that his design in settling here design !
nonsense ,  how can you talk so !
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them ,  and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that .
you and the girls may go ,  or you may send them by themselves ,  which perhaps will be still better ,  for as you are as handsome as any of them ,  mr. bingley may like you the best of the party my dear ,  you flatter me .
i certainly have had my share of beauty ,  but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now .
when a woman has five grownup daughters ,  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty in such cases ,  a woman has not often much beauty to think of but ,  my dear ,  you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for ,  i assure you but consider your daughters .
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go ,  merely on that account ,  for in general ,  you know ,  they visit no newcomers .
indeed you must go ,  for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are overscrupulous ,  surely .
i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you ;  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ;  though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing .
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ;  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane ,  nor half so goodhumoured as lydia .
but you are always giving her the preference they have none of them much to recommend them ,  replied he ;  they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ;  but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr .
bennet ,  how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?
you take delight in vexing me .
you have no compassion for my poor nerves you mistake me ,  my dear .
i have a high respect for your nerves .
they are my old friends .
i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least ah ,  you do not know what i suffer but i hope you will get over it ,  and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood it will be no use to us ,  if twenty such should come ,  since you will not visit them depend upon it ,  my dear ,  that when there are twenty ,  i will visit them all mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts ,  sarcastic humour ,  reserve ,  and caprice ,  that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .
her mind was less difficult to develop .
she was a woman of mean understanding ,  little information ,  and uncertain temper .
when she was discontented ,  she fancied herself nervous .
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ;  its solace was visiting and news .
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley .
he had always intended to visit him ,  though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ;  and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it .
it was then disclosed in the following manner .
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat ,  he suddenly addressed her with :  i hope mr. bingley will like it ,  lizzy we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes ,  said her mother resentfully ,  since we are not to visit but you forget ,  mamma ,  said elizabeth ,  that we shall meet him at the assemblies ,  and that mrs. long promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing .
she has two nieces of her own .
she is a selfish ,  hypocritical woman ,  and i have no opinion of her no more have i ,  said mr. bennet ;  and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply ,  but ,  unable to contain herself ,  began scolding one of her daughters .
dont keep coughing so ,  kitty ,  for heavens sake !
have a little compassion on my nerves .
you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs ,  said her father ;  she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement ,  replied kitty fretfully .
when is your next ball to be ,  lizzy tomorrow fortnight aye ,  so it is ,  cried her mother ,  and mrs. long does not come back till the day before ;  so it will be impossible for her to introduce him ,  for she will not know him herself then ,  my dear ,  you may have the advantage of your friend ,  and introduce mr. bingley to her impossible ,  mr. bennet ,  impossible ,  when i am not acquainted with him myself ;  how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection .
a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little .
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .
but if we do not venture somebody else will ;  and after all ,  mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance ;  and ,  therefore ,  as she will think it an act of kindness ,  if you decline the office ,  i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father .
mrs. bennet said only ,  nonsense ,  nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he .
do you consider the forms of introduction ,  and the stress that is laid on them ,  as nonsense ?
i cannot quite agree with you there .
what say you ,  mary ?
for you are a young lady of deep reflection ,  i know ,  and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something sensible ,  but knew not how .
while mary is adjusting her ideas ,  he continued ,  let us return to mr. bingley i am sick of mr. bingley ,  cried his wife .
i am sorry to hear that ;  but why did not you tell me that before ?
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him .
it is very unlucky ;  but as i have actually paid the visit ,  we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ;  that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ;  though ,  when the first tumult of joy was over ,  she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .
how good it was in you ,  my dear mr. bennet !
but i knew i should persuade you at last .
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .
well ,  how pleased i am !
and it is such a good joke ,  too ,  that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now ,  kitty ,  you may cough as much as you choose ,  said mr. bennet ;  and ,  as he spoke ,  he left the room ,  fatigued with the raptures of his wife .
what an excellent father you have ,  girls said she ,  when the door was shut .
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ;  or me ,  either ,  for that matter .
at our time of life it is not so pleasant ,  i can tell you ,  to be making new acquaintances every day ;  but for your sakes ,  we would do anything .
lydia ,  my love ,  though you are the youngest ,  i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly ,  i am not afraid ;  for though i am the youngest ,  im the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennets visit ,  and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
not all that mrs. bennet ,  however ,  with the assistance of her five daughters ,  could ask on the subject ,  was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley .
they attacked him in various ways — with barefaced questions ,  ingenious suppositions ,  and distant surmises ;  but he eluded the skill of them all ,  and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour ,  lady lucas .
her report was highly favourable .
sir william had been delighted with him .
he was quite young ,  wonderfully handsome ,  extremely agreeable ,  and ,  to crown the whole ,  he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .
nothing could be more delightful !
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ;  and very lively hopes of mr. bingleys heart were entertained .
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield ,  said mrs. bennet to her husband ,  and all the others equally well married ,  i shall have nothing to wish for in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennets visit ,  and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies ,  of whose beauty he had heard much ;  but he saw only the father .
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate ,  for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat ,  and rode a black horse .
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ;  and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping ,  when an answer arrived which deferred it all .
mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day ,  and ,  consequently ,  unable to accept the honour of their invitation ,  etc .
mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted .
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ;  and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another ,  and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ;  and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ,  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing ,  that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london — his five sisters and a cousin .
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether — mr .
bingley ,  his two sisters ,  the husband of the eldest ,  and another young man .
mr. bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike ;  he had a pleasant countenance ,  and easy ,  unaffected manners .
his sisters were fine women ,  with an air of decided fashion .
his brotherinlaw ,  mr. hurst ,  merely looked the gentleman ;  but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine ,  tall person ,  handsome features ,  noble mien ,  and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance ,  of his having ten thousand a year .
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man ,  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley ,  and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening ,  till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ;  for he was discovered to be proud ;  to be above his company ,  and above being pleased ;  and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding ,  disagreeable countenance ,  and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ;  he was lively and unreserved ,  danced every dance ,  was angry that the ball closed so early ,  and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .
what a contrast between him and his friend !
mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley ,  declined being introduced to any other lady ,  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room ,  speaking occasionally to one of his own party .
his character was decided .
he was the proudest ,  most disagreeable man in the world ,  and everybody hoped that he would never come there again .
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet ,  whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters .
elizabeth bennet had been obliged ,  by the scarcity of gentlemen ,  to sit down for two dances ;  and during part of that time ,  mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr. bingley ,  who came from the dance for a few minutes ,  to press his friend to join it .
come ,  darcy ,  said he ,  i must have you dance .
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .
you had much better dance i certainly shall not .
you know how i detest it ,  unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable .
your sisters are engaged ,  and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are ,  cried mr. bingley ,  for a kingdom !
upon my honour ,  i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening ;  and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room ,  said mr. darcy ,  looking at the eldest miss bennet .
oh !
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you ,  who is very pretty ,  and i dare say very agreeable .
do let me ask my partner to introduce you which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth ,  till catching her eye ,  he withdrew his own and coldly said :  she is tolerable ,  but not handsome enough to tempt me ;  i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles ,  for you are wasting your time with me mr. bingley followed his advice .
mr. darcy walked off ;  and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him .
she told the story ,  however ,  with great spirit among her friends ;  for she had a lively ,  playful disposition ,  which delighted in anything ridiculous .
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .
mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .
mr. bingley had danced with her twice ,  and she had been distinguished by his sisters .
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be ,  though in a quieter way .
elizabeth felt janes pleasure .
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ;  and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners ,  which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .
they returned ,  therefore ,  in good spirits to longbourn ,  the village where they lived ,  and of which they were the principal inhabitants .
they found mr. bennet still up .
with a book he was regardless of time ;  and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .
he had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed ;  but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear .
oh ,  my dear mr. bennet ,  as she entered the room ,  we have had a most delightful evening ,  a most excellent ball .
i wish you had been there .
jane was so admired ,  nothing could be like it .
everybody said how well she looked ;  and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful ,  and danced with her twice !
only think of that ,  my dear ;  he actually danced with her twice !
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .
first of all ,  he asked miss lucas .
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her !
but ,  however ,  he did not admire her at all ;  indeed ,  nobody can ,  you know ;  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .
so he inquired who she was ,  and got introduced ,  and asked her for the two next .
then the two third he danced with miss king ,  and the two fourth with maria lucas ,  and the two fifth with jane again ,  and the two sixth with lizzy ,  and the boulanger —  if he had had any compassion for me ,  cried her husband impatiently ,  he would not have danced half so much !
for gods sake ,  say no more of his partners .
oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance oh !
my dear ,  i am quite delighted with him .
he is so excessively handsome !
and his sisters are charming women .
i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses .
i dare say the lace upon mrs. hursts gown —  here she was interrupted again .
mr. bennet protested against any description of finery .
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject ,  and related ,  with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration ,  the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .
but i can assure you ,  she added ,  that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ;  for he is a most disagreeable ,  horrid man ,  not at all worth pleasing .
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !
he walked here ,  and he walked there ,  fancying himself so very great !
not handsome enough to dance with !
i wish you had been there ,  my dear ,  to have given him one of your setdowns .
i quite detest the man when jane and elizabeth were alone ,  the former ,  who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before ,  expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him .
he is just what a young man ought to be ,  said she ,  sensible ,  goodhumoured ,  lively ;  and i never saw such happy manners — so much ease ,  with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome ,  replied elizabeth ,  which a young man ought likewise to be ,  if he possibly can .
his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .
i did not expect such a compliment did not you ?
i did for you .
but that is one great difference between us .
compliments always take you by surprise ,  and me never .
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .
no thanks to his gallantry for that .
well ,  he certainly is very agreeable ,  and i give you leave to like him .
you have liked many a stupider person dear lizzy oh !
you are a great deal too apt ,  you know ,  to like people in general .
you never see a fault in anybody .
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ;  but i always speak what i think i know you do ;  and it is that which makes the wonder .
with your good sense ,  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !
affectation of candour is common enough — one meets with it everywhere .
but to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybodys character and make it still better ,  and say nothing of the bad — belongs to you alone .
and so you like this mans sisters ,  too ,  do you ?
their manners are not equal to his certainly not — at first .
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .
miss bingley is to live with her brother ,  and keep his house ;  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence ,  but was not convinced ;  their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ;  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister ,  and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself ,  she was very little disposed to approve them .
they were in fact very fine ladies ;  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased ,  nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it ,  but proud and conceited .
they were rather handsome ,  had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town ,  had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds ,  were in the habit of spending more than they ought ,  and of associating with people of rank ,  and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves ,  and meanly of others .
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ;  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father ,  who had intended to purchase an estate ,  but did not live to do it .
mr. bingley intended it likewise ,  and sometimes made choice of his county ;  but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor ,  it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper ,  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield ,  and leave the next generation to purchase .
his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ;  but ,  though he was now only established as a tenant ,  miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table — nor was mrs. hurst ,  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune ,  less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .
mr. bingley had not been of age two years ,  when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .
he did look at it ,  and into it for halfanhour — was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms ,  satisfied with what the owner said in its praise ,  and took it immediately .
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship ,  in spite of great opposition of character .
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness ,  openness ,  and ductility of his temper ,  though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own ,  and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .
on the strength of darcys regard ,  bingley had the firmest reliance ,  and of his judgement the highest opinion .
in understanding ,  darcy was the superior .
bingley was by no means deficient ,  but darcy was clever .
he was at the same time haughty ,  reserved ,  and fastidious ,  and his manners ,  though wellbred ,  were not inviting .
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared ,  darcy was continually giving offense .
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .
bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life ;  everybody had been most kind and attentive to him ;  there had been no formality ,  no stiffness ;  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ;  and ,  as to miss bennet ,  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .
darcy ,  on the contrary ,  had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion ,  for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest ,  and from none received either attention or pleasure .
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty ,  but she smiled too much .
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so — but still they admired her and liked her ,  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl ,  and one whom they would not object to know more of .
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl ,  and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose .
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton ,  where he had made a tolerable fortune ,  and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty .
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
it had given him a disgust to his business ,  and to his residence in a small market town ;  and ,  in quitting them both ,  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton ,  denominated from that period lucas lodge ,  where he could think with pleasure of his own importance ,  and ,  unshackled by business ,  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
for ,  though elated by his rank ,  it did not render him supercilious ;  on the contrary ,  he was all attention to everybody .
by nature inoffensive ,  friendly ,  and obliging ,  his presentation at st .
jamess had made him courteous .
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman ,  not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .
they had several children .
the eldest of them ,  a sensible ,  intelligent young woman ,  about twentyseven ,  was elizabeths intimate friend .
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ;  and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .
you began the evening well ,  charlotte ,  said mrs. bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas .
you were mr. bingleys first choice yes ;  but he seemed to like his second better oh !
you mean jane ,  i suppose ,  because he danced with her twice .
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her — indeed i rather believe he did — i heard something about it — but i hardly know what — something about mr. robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson ;  did not i mention it to you ?
mr. robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies ,  and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room ,  and which he thought the prettiest ?
and his answering immediately to the last question :  oh !
the eldest miss bennet ,  beyond a doubt ;  there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word !
well ,  that is very decided indeed — that does seem as if — but ,  however ,  it may all come to nothing ,  you know my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours ,  eliza ,  said charlotte .
mr .
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend ,  is he — poor eliza — to be only just tolerable i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment ,  for he is such a disagreeable man ,  that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .
mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips are you quite sure ,  maam — is not there a little mistake said jane .
i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her aye — because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield ,  and he could not help answering her ;  but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me ,  said jane ,  that he never speaks much ,  unless among his intimate acquaintances .
with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it ,  my dear .
if he had been so very agreeable ,  he would have talked to mrs. long .
but i can guess how it was ;  everybody says that he is eat up with pride ,  and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage ,  and had come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long ,  said miss lucas ,  but i wish he had danced with eliza another time ,  lizzy ,  said her mother ,  i would not dance with him ,  if i were you i believe ,  maam ,  i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride ,  said miss lucas ,  does not offend me so much as pride often does ,  because there is an excuse for it .
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man ,  with family ,  fortune ,  everything in his favour ,  should think highly of himself .
if i may so express it ,  he has a right to be proud that is very true ,  replied elizabeth ,  and i could easily forgive his pride ,  if he had not mortified mine pride ,  observed mary ,  who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections ,  is a very common failing ,  i believe .
by all that i have ever read ,  i am convinced that it is very common indeed ;  that human nature is particularly prone to it ,  and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other ,  real or imaginary .
vanity and pride are different things ,  though the words are often used synonymously .
a person may be proud without being vain .
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ,  vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr. darcy ,  cried a young lucas ,  who came with his sisters ,  i should not care how proud i was .
i would keep a pack of foxhounds ,  and drink a bottle of wine a day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought ,  said mrs. bennet ;  and if i were to see you at it ,  i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not ;  she continued to declare that she would ,  and the argument ended only with the visit .
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .
the visit was soon returned in due form .
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ;  and though the mother was found to be intolerable ,  and the younger sisters not worth speaking to ,  a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest .
by jane ,  this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ,  but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody ,  hardly excepting even her sister ,  and could not like them ;  though their kindness to jane ,  such as it was ,  had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration .
it was generally evident whenever they met ,  that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first ,  and was in a way to be very much in love ;  but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general ,  since jane united ,  with great strength of feeling ,  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
it may perhaps be pleasant ,  replied charlotte ,  to be able to impose on the public in such a case ;  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it ,  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ;  and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment ,  that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
we can all begin freely — a slight preference is natural enough ;  but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels .
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ;  but he may never do more than like her ,  if she does not help him on but she does help him on ,  as much as her nature will allow .
if i can perceive her regard for him ,  he must be a simpleton ,  indeed ,  not to discover it too remember ,  eliza ,  that he does not know janes disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man ,  and does not endeavour to conceal it ,  he must find it out perhaps he must ,  if he sees enough of her .
but ,  though bingley and jane meet tolerably often ,  it is never for many hours together ;  and ,  as they always see each other in large mixed parties ,  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .
jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention .
when she is secure of him ,  there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one ,  replied elizabeth ,  where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ,  and if i were determined to get a rich husband ,  or any husband ,  i dare say i should adopt it .
but these are not janes feelings ;  she is not acting by design .
as yet ,  she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness .
she has known him only a fortnight .
she danced four dances with him at meryton ;  she saw him one morning at his own house ,  and has since dined with him in company four times .
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it .
had she merely dined with him ,  she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ;  but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together — and four evenings may do a great deal yes ;  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce ;  but with respect to any other leading characteristic ,  i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well ,  said charlotte ,  i wish jane success with all my heart ;  and if she were married to him tomorrow ,  i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand ,  it does not advance their felicity in the least .
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ;  and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life you make me laugh ,  charlotte ;  but it is not sound .
you know it is not sound ,  and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr. bingleys attentions to her sister ,  elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .
mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ;  he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ;  and when they next met ,  he looked at her only to criticise .
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face ,  than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form ,  he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ;  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world ,  he was caught by their easy playfulness .
of this she was perfectly unaware ;  to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere ,  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
he began to wish to know more of her ,  and as a step towards conversing with her himself ,  attended to her conversation with others .
his doing so drew her notice .
it was at sir william lucass ,  where a large party were assembled .
what does mr. darcy mean ,  said she to charlotte ,  by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
he has a very satirical eye ,  and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself ,  i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approaching them soon afterwards ,  though without seeming to have any intention of speaking ,  miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him ;  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it ,  she turned to him and said :  did you not think ,  mr. darcy ,  that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now ,  when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy ;  but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teased ,  said miss lucas .
i am going to open the instrument ,  eliza ,  and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend — always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody !
if my vanity had taken a musical turn ,  you would have been invaluable ;  but as it is ,  i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering ,  however ,  she added ,  very well ,  if it must be so ,  it must and gravely glancing at mr. darcy ,  there is a fine old saying ,  which everybody here is of course familiar with :  keep your breath to cool your porridge ;  and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing ,  though by no means capital .
after a song or two ,  and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again ,  she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary ,  who having ,  in consequence of being the only plain one in the family ,  worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments ,  was always impatient for display .
mary had neither genius nor taste ;  and though vanity had given her application ,  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner ,  which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .
elizabeth ,  easy and unaffected ,  had been listened to with much more pleasure ,  though not playing half so well ;  and mary ,  at the end of a long concerto ,  was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs ,  at the request of her younger sisters ,  who ,  with some of the lucases ,  and two or three officers ,  joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening ,  to the exclusion of all conversation ,  and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour ,  till sir william thus began :  what a charming amusement for young people this is ,  mr. darcy !
there is nothing like dancing after all .
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society certainly ,  sir ;  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .
every savage can dance sir william only smiled .
your friend performs delightfully ,  he continued after a pause ,  on seeing bingley join the group ;  and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself ,  mr. darcy you saw me dance at meryton ,  i believe ,  sir yes ,  indeed ,  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .
do you often dance at st .
jamess never ,  sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town ,  i conclude mr. darcy bowed .
i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself — for i am fond of superior society ;  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer ;  but his companion was not disposed to make any ;  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them ,  he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing ,  and called out to her :  my dear miss eliza ,  why are you not dancing ?
mr. darcy ,  you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .
you cannot refuse to dance ,  i am sure when so much beauty is before you and ,  taking her hand ,  he would have given it to mr. darcy who ,  though extremely surprised ,  was not unwilling to receive it ,  when she instantly drew back ,  and said with some discomposure to sir william :  indeed ,  sir ,  i have not the least intention of dancing .
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr. darcy ,  with grave propriety ,  requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ,  but in vain .
elizabeth was determined ;  nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .
you excel so much in the dance ,  miss eliza ,  that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ;  and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general ,  he can have no objection ,  i am sure ,  to oblige us for one halfhour mr .
darcy is all politeness ,  said elizabeth ,  smiling .
he is ,  indeed ;  but ,  considering the inducement ,  my dear miss eliza ,  we cannot wonder at his complaisance — for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly ,  and turned away .
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman ,  and he was thinking of her with some complacency ,  when thus accosted by miss bingley :  i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner — in such society ;  and indeed i am quite of your opinion .
i was never more annoyed !
the insipidity ,  and yet the noise — the nothingness ,  and yet the selfimportance of all those people !
what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong ,  i assure you .
my mind was more agreeably engaged .
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face ,  and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .
mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity :  miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley .
i am all astonishment .
how long has she been such a favourite — and pray ,  when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .
a ladys imagination is very rapid ;  it jumps from admiration to love ,  from love to matrimony ,  in a moment .
i knew you would be wishing me joy nay ,  if you are serious about it ,  i shall consider the matter is absolutely settled .
you will be having a charming motherinlaw ,  indeed ;  and ,  of course ,  she will always be at pemberley with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner ;  and as his composure convinced her that all was safe ,  her wit flowed long .
mr. bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year ,  which ,  unfortunately for his daughters ,  was entailed ,  in default of heirs male ,  on a distant relation ;  and their mothers fortune ,  though ample for her situation in life ,  could but ill supply the deficiency of his .
her father had been an attorney in meryton ,  and had left her four thousand pounds .
she had a sister married to a mr. phillips ,  who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business ,  and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ;  a most convenient distance for the young ladies ,  who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week ,  to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way .
the two youngest of the family ,  catherine and lydia ,  were particularly frequent in these attentions ;  their minds were more vacant than their sisters ,  and when nothing better offered ,  a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ;  and however bare of news the country in general might be ,  they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .
at present ,  indeed ,  they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ;  it was to remain the whole winter ,  and meryton was the headquarters .
their visits to mrs. phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections .
their lodgings were not long a secret ,  and at length they began to know the officers themselves .
mr. phillips visited them all ,  and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before .
they could talk of nothing but officers ;  and mr. bingleys large fortune ,  the mention of which gave animation to their mother ,  was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject ,  mr. bennet coolly observed :  from all that i can collect by your manner of talking ,  you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .
i have suspected it some time ,  but i am now convinced catherine was disconcerted ,  and made no answer ;  but lydia ,  with perfect indifference ,  continued to express her admiration of captain carter ,  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day ,  as he was going the next morning to london .
i am astonished ,  my dear ,  said mrs. bennet ,  that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children ,  it should not be of my own ,  however if my children are silly ,  i must hope to be always sensible of it yes — but as it happens ,  they are all of them very clever this is the only point ,  i flatter myself ,  on which we do not agree .
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular ,  but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr. bennet ,  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .
when they get to our age ,  i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well — and ,  indeed ,  so i do still at my heart ;  and if a smart young colonel ,  with five or six thousand a year ,  should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him ;  and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals mamma ,  cried lydia ,  my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came ;  she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ;  it came from netherfield ,  and the servant waited for an answer .
mrs. bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure ,  and she was eagerly calling out ,  while her daughter read ,  well ,  jane ,  who is it from ?
what is it about ?
what does he say ?
well ,  jane ,  make haste and tell us ;  make haste ,  my love it is from miss bingley ,  said jane ,  and then read it aloud .
my dear friend ,  —  if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me ,  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ,  for a whole days ttette between two women can never end without a quarrel .
come as soon as you can on receipt of this .
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers — yours ever ,  caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia .
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out ,  said mrs. bennet ,  that is very unlucky can i have the carriage said jane .
no ,  my dear ,  you had better go on horseback ,  because it seems likely to rain ;  and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme ,  said elizabeth ,  if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh !
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingleys chaise to go to meryton ,  and the hursts have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach but ,  my dear ,  your father cannot spare the horses ,  i am sure .
they are wanted in the farm ,  mr. bennet ,  are they not they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them but if you have got them today ,  said elizabeth ,  my mothers purpose will be answered she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback ,  and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
her hopes were answered ;  jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .
her sisters were uneasy for her ,  but her mother was delighted .
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ;  jane certainly could not come back .
this was a lucky idea of mine ,  indeed said mrs. bennet more than once ,  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .
till the next morning ,  however ,  she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth :  my dearest lizzy ,  —  i find myself very unwell this morning ,  which ,  i suppose ,  is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .
my kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am better .
they insist also on my seeing mr. jones — therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me — and ,  excepting a sore throat and headache ,  there is not much the matter with me — yours ,  etc well ,  my dear ,  said mr. bennet ,  when elizabeth had read the note aloud ,  if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness — if she should die ,  it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley ,  and under your orders oh !
i am not afraid of her dying .
people do not die of little trifling colds .
she will be taken good care of .
as long as she stays there ,  it is all very well .
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth ,  feeling really anxious ,  was determined to go to her ,  though the carriage was not to be had ;  and as she was no horsewoman ,  walking was her only alternative .
she declared her resolution .
how can you be so silly ,  cried her mother ,  as to think of such a thing ,  in all this dirt !
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see jane — which is all i want is this a hint to me ,  lizzy ,  said her father ,  to send for the horses no ,  indeed ,  i do not wish to avoid the walk .
the distance is nothing when one has a motive ;  only three miles .
i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence ,  observed mary ,  but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ;  and ,  in my opinion ,  exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as meryton with you ,  said catherine and lydia .
elizabeth accepted their company ,  and the three young ladies set off together .
if we make haste ,  said lydia ,  as they walked along ,  perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in meryton they parted ;  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives ,  and elizabeth continued her walk alone ,  crossing field after field at a quick pace ,  jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity ,  and finding herself at last within view of the house ,  with weary ankles ,  dirty stockings ,  and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .
she was shown into the breakfastparlour ,  where all but jane were assembled ,  and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day ,  in such dirty weather ,  and by herself ,  was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ;  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .
she was received ,  however ,  very politely by them ;  and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness ;  there was good humour and kindness .
mr. darcy said very little ,  and mr. hurst nothing at all .
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion ,  and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone .
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .
miss bennet had slept ill ,  and though up ,  was very feverish ,  and not well enough to leave her room .
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ;  and jane ,  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit ,  was delighted at her entrance .
she was not equal ,  however ,  to much conversation ,  and when miss bingley left them together ,  could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .
elizabeth silently attended her .
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ;  and elizabeth began to like them herself ,  when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane .
the apothecary came ,  and having examined his patient ,  said ,  as might be supposed ,  that she had caught a violent cold ,  and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ;  advised her to return to bed ,  and promised her some draughts .
the advice was followed readily ,  for the feverish symptoms increased ,  and her head ached acutely .
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment ;  nor were the other ladies often absent ;  the gentlemen being out ,  they had ,  in fact ,  nothing to do elsewhere .
when the clock struck three ,  elizabeth felt that she must go ,  and very unwillingly said so .
miss bingley offered her the carriage ,  and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it ,  when jane testified such concern in parting with her ,  that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .
elizabeth most thankfully consented ,  and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes .
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress ,  and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .
to the civil inquiries which then poured in ,  and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingleys ,  she could not make a very favourable answer .
jane was by no means better .
the sisters ,  on hearing this ,  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved ,  how shocking it was to have a bad cold ,  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ;  and then thought no more of the matter :  and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike .
their brother ,  indeed ,  was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .
his anxiety for jane was evident ,  and his attentions to herself most pleasing ,  and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .
she had very little notice from any but him .
miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy ,  her sister scarcely less so ;  and as for mr. hurst ,  by whom elizabeth sat ,  he was an indolent man ,  who lived only to eat ,  drink ,  and play at cards ;  who ,  when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout ,  had nothing to say to her .
when dinner was over ,  she returned directly to jane ,  and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed ,  a mixture of pride and impertinence ;  she had no conversation ,  no style ,  no beauty .
mrs. hurst thought the same ,  and added :  she has nothing ,  in short ,  to recommend her ,  but being an excellent walker .
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .
she really looked almost wild she did ,  indeed ,  louisa .
i could hardly keep my countenance .
very nonsensical to come at all !
why must she be scampering about the country ,  because her sister had a cold ?
her hair ,  so untidy ,  so blowsy yes ,  and her petticoat ;  i hope you saw her petticoat ,  six inches deep in mud ,  i am absolutely certain ;  and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact ,  louisa ,  said bingley ;  but this was all lost upon me .
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning .
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice you observed it ,  mr. darcy ,  i am sure ,  said miss bingley ;  and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles ,  or four miles ,  or five miles ,  or whatever it is ,  above her ankles in dirt ,  and alone ,  quite alone !
what could she mean by it ?
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence ,  a most countrytown indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing ,  said bingley .
i am afraid ,  mr. darcy ,  observed miss bingley in a half whisper ,  that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all ,  he replied ;  they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech ,  and mrs. hurst began again :  i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet ,  she is really a very sweet girl ,  and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .
but with such a father and mother ,  and such low connections ,  i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton yes ;  and they have another ,  who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital ,  added her sister ,  and they both laughed heartily .
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside ,  cried bingley ,  it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world ,  replied darcy .
to this speech bingley made no answer ;  but his sisters gave it their hearty assent ,  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations .
with a renewal of tenderness ,  however ,  they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour ,  and sat with her till summoned to coffee .
she was still very poorly ,  and elizabeth would not quit her at all ,  till late in the evening ,  when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep ,  and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself .
on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo ,  and was immediately invited to join them ;  but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it ,  and making her sister the excuse ,  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below ,  with a book .
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment .
do you prefer reading to cards said he ;  that is rather singular miss eliza bennet ,  said miss bingley ,  despises cards .
she is a great reader ,  and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure ,  cried elizabeth ;  i am not a great reader ,  and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure ,  said bingley ;  and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart ,  and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying .
he immediately offered to fetch her others — all that his library afforded .
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ;  but i am an idle fellow ,  and though i have not many ,  i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .
i am astonished ,  said miss bingley ,  that my father should have left so small a collection of books .
what a delightful library you have at pemberley ,  mr. darcy it ought to be good ,  he replied ,  it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself ,  you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect !
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .
charles ,  when you build your house ,  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood ,  and take pemberley for a kind of model .
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart ;  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities ,  charles upon my word ,  caroline ,  i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught with what passed ,  as to leave her very little attention for her book ;  and soon laying it wholly aside ,  she drew near the cardtable ,  and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister ,  to observe the game .
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley ;  will she be as tall as i am i think she will .
she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height ,  or rather taller how i long to see her again !
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .
such a countenance ,  such manners !
and so extremely accomplished for her age !
her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me ,  said bingley ,  how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are all young ladies accomplished !
my dear charles ,  what do you mean yes ,  all of them ,  i think .
they all paint tables ,  cover screens ,  and net purses .
i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this ,  and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time ,  without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments ,  said darcy ,  has too much truth .
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen .
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .
i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen ,  in the whole range of my acquaintance ,  that are really accomplished nor i ,  i am sure ,  said miss bingley .
then ,  observed elizabeth ,  you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes ,  i do comprehend a great deal in it oh !
certainly ,  cried his faithful assistant ,  no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music ,  singing ,  drawing ,  dancing ,  and the modern languages ,  to deserve the word ;  and besides all this ,  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking ,  the tone of her voice ,  her address and expressions ,  or the word will be but halfdeserved all this she must possess ,  added darcy ,  and to all this she must yet add something more substantial ,  in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .
i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman .
i never saw such capacity ,  and taste ,  and application ,  and elegance ,  as you describe united mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt ,  and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description ,  when mr. hurst called them to order ,  with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .
as all conversation was thereby at an end ,  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .
elizabeth bennet ,  said miss bingley ,  when the door was closed on her ,  is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ;  and with many men ,  i dare say ,  it succeeds .
but ,  in my opinion ,  it is a paltry device ,  a very mean art undoubtedly ,  replied darcy ,  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed ,  there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse ,  and that she could not leave her .
bingley urged mr. jones being sent for immediately ;  while his sisters ,  convinced that no country advice could be of any service ,  recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .
this she would not hear of ;  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal ;  and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning ,  if miss bennet were not decidedly better .
bingley was quite uncomfortable ;  his sisters declared that they were miserable .
they solaced their wretchedness ,  however ,  by duets after supper ,  while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room ,  and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid ,  and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .
in spite of this amendment ,  however ,  she requested to have a note sent to longbourn ,  desiring her mother to visit jane ,  and form her own judgement of her situation .
the note was immediately dispatched ,  and its contents as quickly complied with .
mrs. bennet ,  accompanied by her two youngest girls ,  reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
had she found jane in any apparent danger ,  mrs. bennet would have been very miserable ;  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming ,  she had no wish of her recovering immediately ,  as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .
she would not listen ,  therefore ,  to her daughters proposal of being carried home ;  neither did the apothecary ,  who arrived about the same time ,  think it at all advisable .
after sitting a little while with jane ,  on miss bingleys appearance and invitation ,  the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .
indeed i have ,  sir ,  was her answer .
she is a great deal too ill to be moved .
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her .
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley .
it must not be thought of .
my sister ,  i am sure ,  will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it ,  madam ,  said miss bingley ,  with cold civility ,  that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .
i am sure ,  she added ,  if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her ,  for she is very ill indeed ,  and suffers a vast deal ,  though with the greatest patience in the world ,  which is always the way with her ,  for she has ,  without exception ,  the sweetest temper i have ever met with .
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .
you have a sweet room here ,  mr. bingley ,  and a charming prospect over the gravel walk .
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry ,  i hope ,  though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry ,  replied he ;  and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield ,  i should probably be off in five minutes .
at present ,  however ,  i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you ,  said elizabeth .
you begin to comprehend me ,  do you cried he ,  turning towards her .
oh !
yes — i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment ;  but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens .
it does not follow that a deep ,  intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy ,  cried her mother ,  remember where you are ,  and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before ,  continued bingley immediately ,  that you were a studier of character .
it must be an amusing study yes ,  but intricate characters are the most amusing .
they have at least that advantage the country ,  said darcy ,  can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study .
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much ,  that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes ,  indeed ,  cried mrs. bennet ,  offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised ,  and darcy ,  after looking at her for a moment ,  turned silently away .
mrs. bennet ,  who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him ,  continued her triumph .
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country ,  for my part ,  except the shops and public places .
the country is a vast deal pleasanter ,  is it not ,  mr. bingley when i am in the country ,  he replied ,  i never wish to leave it ;  and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .
they have each their advantages ,  and i can be equally happy in either aye — that is because you have the right disposition .
but that gentleman ,  looking at darcy ,  seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed ,  mamma ,  you are mistaken ,  said elizabeth ,  blushing for her mother .
you quite mistook mr. darcy .
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town ,  which you must acknowledge to be true certainly ,  my dear ,  nobody said there were ;  but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood ,  i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
i know we dine with fourandtwenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .
his sister was less delicate ,  and directed her eyes towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile .
elizabeth ,  for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts ,  now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away .
yes ,  she called yesterday with her father .
what an agreeable man sir william is ,  mr. bingley ,  is not he ?
so much the man of fashion !
so genteel and easy !
he has always something to say to everybody .
that is my idea of good breeding ;  and those persons who fancy themselves very important ,  and never open their mouths ,  quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no ,  she would go home .
i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies .
for my part ,  mr. bingley ,  i always keep servants that can do their own work ;  my daughters are brought up very differently .
but everybody is to judge for themselves ,  and the lucases are a very good sort of girls ,  i assure you .
it is a pity they are not handsome !
not that i think charlotte so very plain — but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman oh !
dear ,  yes ;  but you must own she is very plain .
lady lucas herself has often said so ,  and envied me janes beauty .
i do not like to boast of my own child ,  but to be sure ,  jane — one does not often see anybody better looking .
it is what everybody says .
i do not trust my own partiality .
when she was only fifteen ,  there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .
but ,  however ,  he did not .
perhaps he thought her too young .
however ,  he wrote some verses on her ,  and very pretty they were and so ended his affection ,  said elizabeth impatiently .
there has been many a one ,  i fancy ,  overcome in the same way .
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love ,  said darcy .
of a fine ,  stout ,  healthy love it may .
everything nourishes what is strong already .
but if it be only a slight ,  thin sort of inclination ,  i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled ;  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .
she longed to speak ,  but could think of nothing to say ;  and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane ,  with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .
mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer ,  and forced his younger sister to be civil also ,  and say what the occasion required .
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness ,  but mrs. bennet was satisfied ,  and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .
upon this signal ,  the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit ,  and the result of it was ,  that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .
lydia was a stout ,  wellgrown girl of fifteen ,  with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance ;  a favourite with her mother ,  whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .
she had high animal spirits ,  and a sort of natural selfconsequence ,  which the attention of the officers ,  to whom her uncles good dinners ,  and her own easy manners recommended her ,  had increased into assurance .
she was very equal ,  therefore ,  to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball ,  and abruptly reminded him of his promise ;  adding ,  that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear :  i am perfectly ready ,  i assure you ,  to keep my engagement ;  and when your sister is recovered ,  you shall ,  if you please ,  name the very day of the ball .
but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied .
oh !
yes — it would be much better to wait till jane was well ,  and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .
and when you have given your ball ,  she added ,  i shall insist on their giving one also .
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed ,  and elizabeth returned instantly to jane ,  leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy ;  the latter of whom ,  however ,  could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her ,  in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes .
the day passed much as the day before had done .
mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid ,  who continued ,  though slowly ,  to mend ;  and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom .
the lootable ,  however ,  did not appear .
mr. darcy was writing ,  and miss bingley ,  seated near him ,  was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .
mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet ,  and mrs. hurst was observing their game .
elizabeth took up some needlework ,  and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .
the perpetual commendations of the lady ,  either on his handwriting ,  or on the evenness of his lines ,  or on the length of his letter ,  with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received ,  formed a curious dialogue ,  and was exactly in union with her opinion of each .
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer .
you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken .
i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year !
letters of business ,  too !
how odious i should think them it is fortunate ,  then ,  that they fall to my lot instead of yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so once ,  by your desire i am afraid you do not like your pen .
let me mend it for you .
i mend pens remarkably well thank you — but i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even he was silent .
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp ;  and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table ,  and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?
at present i have not room to do them justice oh !
it is of no consequence .
i shall see her in january .
but do you always write such charming long letters to her ,  mr. darcy they are generally long ;  but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me ,  that a person who can write a long letter with ease ,  cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy ,  caroline ,  cried her brother ,  because he does not write with ease .
he studies too much for words of four syllables .
do not you ,  darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley ,  charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .
he leaves out half his words ,  and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them — by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility ,  mr. bingley ,  said elizabeth ,  must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful ,  said darcy ,  than the appearance of humility .
it is often only carelessness of opinion ,  and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast ;  for you are really proud of your defects in writing ,  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution ,  which ,  if not estimable ,  you think at least highly interesting .
the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor ,  and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes ,  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric ,  of compliment to yourself — and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone ,  and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay ,  cried bingley ,  this is too much ,  to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .
and yet ,  upon my honour ,  i believe what i said of myself to be true ,  and i believe it at this moment .
at least ,  therefore ,  i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies i dare say you believed it ;  but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know ;  and if ,  as you were mounting your horse ,  a friend were to say ,  bingley ,  you had better stay till next week ,  you would probably do it ,  you would probably not go — and at another word ,  might stay a month you have only proved by this ,  cried elizabeth ,  that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified ,  said bingley ,  by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ;  for he would certainly think better of me ,  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial ,  and ride off as fast as i could would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word ,  i cannot exactly explain the matter ;  darcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine ,  but which i have never acknowledged .
allowing the case ,  however ,  to stand according to your representation ,  you must remember ,  miss bennet ,  that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house ,  and the delay of his plan ,  has merely desired it ,  asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily — easily — to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me ,  mr. darcy ,  to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request ,  without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley .
we may as well wait ,  perhaps ,  till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend ,  where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment ,  should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire ,  without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable ,  before we proceed on this subject ,  to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request ,  as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means ,  cried bingley ;  let us hear all the particulars ,  not forgetting their comparative height and size ;  for that will have more weight in the argument ,  miss bennet ,  than you may be aware of .
i assure you ,  that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow ,  in comparison with myself ,  i should not pay him half so much deference .
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy ,  on particular occasions ,  and in particular places ;  at his own house especially ,  and of a sunday evening ,  when he has nothing to do mr. darcy smiled ;  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ,  and therefore checked her laugh .
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received ,  in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .
i see your design ,  bingley ,  said his friend .
you dislike an argument ,  and want to silence this perhaps i do .
arguments are too much like disputes .
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room ,  i shall be very thankful ;  and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask ,  said elizabeth ,  is no sacrifice on my side ;  and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter mr. darcy took her advice ,  and did finish his letter .
when that business was over ,  he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music .
miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte ;  and ,  after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived ,  she seated herself .
mrs. hurst sang with her sister ,  and while they were thus employed ,  elizabeth could not help observing ,  as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument ,  how frequently mr. darcys eyes were fixed on her .
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ;  and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her ,  was still more strange .
she could only imagine ,  however ,  at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible ,  according to his ideas of right ,  than in any other person present .
the supposition did not pain her .
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .
after playing some italian songs ,  miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ;  and soon afterwards mr. darcy ,  drawing near elizabeth ,  said to her :  do not you feel a great inclination ,  miss bennet ,  to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled ,  but made no answer .
he repeated the question ,  with some surprise at her silence .
oh said she ,  i heard you before ,  but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .
you wanted me ,  i know ,  to say yes ,  that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ;  but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes ,  and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .
i have ,  therefore ,  made up my mind to tell you ,  that i do not want to dance a reel at all — and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth ,  having rather expected to affront him ,  was amazed at his gallantry ;  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ;  and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .
he really believed ,  that were it not for the inferiority of her connections ,  he should be in some danger .
miss bingley saw ,  or suspected enough to be jealous ;  and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest ,  by talking of their supposed marriage ,  and planning his happiness in such an alliance .
i hope ,  said she ,  as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day ,  you will give your motherinlaw a few hints ,  when this desirable event takes place ,  as to the advantage of holding her tongue ;  and if you can compass it ,  do cure the younger girls of running after officers .
and ,  if i may mention so delicate a subject ,  endeavour to check that little something ,  bordering on conceit and impertinence ,  which your lady possesses have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity oh !
yes .
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .
put them next to your greatuncle the judge .
they are in the same profession ,  you know ,  only in different lines .
as for your elizabeths picture ,  you must not have it taken ,  for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy ,  indeed ,  to catch their expression ,  but their colour and shape ,  and the eyelashes ,  so remarkably fine ,  might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .
i did not know that you intended to walk ,  said miss bingley ,  in some confusion ,  lest they had been overheard .
you used us abominably ill ,  answered mrs. hurst ,  running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy ,  she left elizabeth to walk by herself .
the path just admitted three .
mr. darcy felt their rudeness ,  and immediately said :  this walk is not wide enough for our party .
we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth ,  who had not the least inclination to remain with them ,  laughingly answered :  no ,  no ;  stay where you are .
you are charmingly grouped ,  and appear to uncommon advantage .
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
goodbye she then ran gaily off ,  rejoicing as she rambled about ,  in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
when the ladies removed after dinner ,  elizabeth ran up to her sister ,  and seeing her well guarded from cold ,  attended her into the drawingroom ,  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ;  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .
their powers of conversation were considerable .
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy ,  relate an anecdote with humour ,  and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
but when the gentlemen entered ,  jane was no longer the first object ;  miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy ,  and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
he addressed himself to miss bennet ,  with a polite congratulation ;  mr. hurst also made her a slight bow ,  and said he was very glad ;  but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation .
he was full of joy and attention .
the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire ,  lest she should suffer from the change of room ;  and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace ,  that she might be further from the door .
he then sat down by her ,  and talked scarcely to anyone else .
elizabeth ,  at work in the opposite corner ,  saw it all with great delight .
when tea was over ,  mr. hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtable — but in vain .
she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards ;  and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
she assured him that no one intended to play ,  and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her .
mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do ,  but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep .
darcy took up a book ;  miss bingley did the same ;  and mrs. hurst ,  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings ,  joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet .
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcys progress through his book ,  as in reading her own ;  and she was perpetually either making some inquiry ,  or looking at his page .
she could not win him ,  however ,  to any conversation ;  he merely answered her question ,  and read on .
at length ,  quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book ,  which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his ,  she gave a great yawn and said ,  how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book !
when i have a house of my own ,  i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply .
she then yawned again ,  threw aside her book ,  and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement ;  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet ,  she turned suddenly towards him and said :  by the bye ,  charles ,  are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?
i would advise you ,  before you determine on it ,  to consult the wishes of the present party ;  i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy ,  cried her brother ,  he may go to bed ,  if he chooses ,  before it begins — but as for the ball ,  it is quite a settled thing ;  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough ,  i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better ,  she replied ,  if they were carried on in a different manner ;  but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day much more rational ,  my dear caroline ,  i dare say ,  but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer ,  and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room .
her figure was elegant ,  and she walked well ;  but darcy ,  at whom it was all aimed ,  was still inflexibly studious .
in the desperation of her feelings ,  she resolved on one effort more ,  and ,  turning to elizabeth ,  said :  miss eliza bennet ,  let me persuade you to follow my example ,  and take a turn about the room .
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised ,  but agreed to it immediately .
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ;  mr. darcy looked up .
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be ,  and unconsciously closed his book .
he was directly invited to join their party ,  but he declined it ,  observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together ,  with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .
what could he mean ?
she was dying to know what could be his meaning — and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?
not at all ,  was her answer ;  but depend upon it ,  he means to be severe on us ,  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it miss bingley ,  however ,  was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything ,  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them ,  said he ,  as soon as she allowed him to speak .
you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence ,  and have secret affairs to discuss ,  or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ;  if the first ,  i would be completely in your way ,  and if the second ,  i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh !
shocking cried miss bingley .
i never heard anything so abominable .
how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy ,  if you have but the inclination ,  said elizabeth .
we can all plague and punish one another .
tease him — laugh at him .
intimate as you are ,  you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour ,  i do not .
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .
tease calmness of manner and presence of mind !
no ,  no ;  i feel he may defy us there .
and as to laughter ,  we will not expose ourselves ,  if you please ,  by attempting to laugh without a subject .
mr. darcy may hug himself mr .
darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth .
that is an uncommon advantage ,  and uncommon i hope it will continue ,  for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances .
i dearly love a laugh miss bingley ,  said he ,  has given me more credit than can be .
the wisest and the best of men — nay ,  the wisest and best of their actions — may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly ,  replied elizabeth — there are such people ,  but i hope i am not one of them .
i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good .
follies and nonsense ,  whims and inconsistencies ,  do divert me ,  i own ,  and i laugh at them whenever i can .
but these ,  i suppose ,  are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for anyone .
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes ,  vanity is a weakness indeed .
but pride — where there is a real superiority of mind ,  pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .
your examination of mr. darcy is over ,  i presume ,  said miss bingley ;  and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect .
he owns it himself without disguise no ,  said darcy ,  i have made no such pretension .
i have faults enough ,  but they are not ,  i hope ,  of understanding .
my temper i dare not vouch for .
it is ,  i believe ,  too little yielding — certainly too little for the convenience of the world .
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought ,  nor their offenses against myself .
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .
my good opinion once lost ,  is lost forever that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth .
implacable resentment is a shade in a character .
but you have chosen your fault well .
i really cannot laugh at it .
you are safe from me there is ,  i believe ,  in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil — a natural defect ,  which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is to hate everybody and yours ,  he replied with a smile ,  is willfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music ,  cried miss bingley ,  tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
louisa ,  you will not mind my waking mr. hurst her sister had not the smallest objection ,  and the pianoforte was opened ;  and darcy ,  after a few moments recollection ,  was not sorry for it .
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters ,  elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother ,  to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .
but mrs. bennet ,  who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday ,  which would exactly finish janes week ,  could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .
her answer ,  therefore ,  was not propitious ,  at least not to elizabeths wishes ,  for she was impatient to get home .
mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ;  and in her postscript it was added ,  that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer ,  she could spare them very well .
against staying longer ,  however ,  elizabeth was positively resolved — nor did she much expect it would be asked ;  and fearful ,  on the contrary ,  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long ,  she urged jane to borrow mr. bingleys carriage immediately ,  and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned ,  and the request made .
the communication excited many professions of concern ;  and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ;  and till the morrow their going was deferred .
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay ,  for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon ,  and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her — that she was not enough recovered ;  but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence — elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .
she attracted him more than he liked — and miss bingley was uncivil to her ,  and more teasing than usual to himself .
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him ,  nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ;  sensible that if such an idea had been suggested ,  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .
steady to his purpose ,  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday ,  and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour ,  he adhered most conscientiously to his book ,  and would not even look at her .
on sunday ,  after morning service ,  the separation ,  so agreeable to almost all ,  took place .
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly ,  as well as her affection for jane ;  and when they parted ,  after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield ,  and embracing her most tenderly ,  she even shook hands with the former .
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits .
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .
mrs. bennet wondered at their coming ,  and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble ,  and was sure jane would have caught cold again .
but their father ,  though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure ,  was really glad to see them ;  he had felt their importance in the family circle .
the evening conversation ,  when they were all assembled ,  had lost much of its animation ,  and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth .
they found mary ,  as usual ,  deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature ;  and had some extracts to admire ,  and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to .
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ;  several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle ,  a private had been flogged ,  and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .
i hope ,  my dear ,  said mr. bennet to his wife ,  as they were at breakfast the next morning ,  that you have ordered a good dinner today ,  because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean ,  my dear ?
i know of nobody that is coming ,  i am sure ,  unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in — and i hope my dinners are good enough for her .
i do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman ,  and a stranger mrs. bennets eyes sparkled .
a gentleman and a stranger !
it is mr. bingley ,  i am sure !
well ,  i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley .
but — good lord !
how unlucky !
there is not a bit of fish to be got today .
lydia ,  my love ,  ring the bell — i must speak to hill this moment it is not mr. bingley ,  said her husband ;  it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment ;  and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once .
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity ,  he thus explained :  about a month ago i received this letter ;  and about a fortnight ago i answered it ,  for i thought it a case of some delicacy ,  and requiring early attention .
it is from my cousin ,  mr. collins ,  who ,  when i am dead ,  may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh !
my dear ,  cried his wife ,  i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .
pray do not talk of that odious man .
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world ,  that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ;  and i am sure ,  if i had been you ,  i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail .
they had often attempted to do it before ,  but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason ,  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters ,  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair ,  said mr. bennet ,  and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .
but if you will listen to his letter ,  you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no ,  that i am sure i shall not ;  and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all ,  and very hypocritical .
i hate such false friends .
why could he not keep on quarreling with you ,  as his father did before him why ,  indeed ;  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head ,  as you will hear hunsford ,  near westerham ,  kent ,  th october .
dear sir ,  —  the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ,  and since i have had the misfortune to lose him ,  i have frequently wished to heal the breach ;  but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts ,  fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance — there ,  mrs. bennet — my mind ,  however ,  is now made up on the subject ,  for having received ordination at easter ,  i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh ,  widow of sir lewis de bourgh ,  whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish ,  where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship ,  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .
as a clergyman ,  moreover ,  i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ;  and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable ,  and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side ,  and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch .
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters ,  and beg leave to apologise for it ,  as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends — but of this hereafter .
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house ,  i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family ,  monday ,  november th ,  by four oclock ,  and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following ,  which i can do without any inconvenience ,  as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday ,  provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day — i remain ,  dear sir ,  with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters ,  your wellwisher and friend ,  william collins at four oclock ,  therefore ,  we may expect this peacemaking gentleman ,  said mr. bennet ,  as he folded up the letter .
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man ,  upon my word ,  and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance ,  especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls ,  however ,  and if he is disposed to make them any amends ,  i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult ,  said jane ,  to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due ,  the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine ,  and his kind intention of christening ,  marrying ,  and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .
he must be an oddity ,  i think ,  said she .
i cannot make him out — there is something very pompous in his style — and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail — we cannot suppose he would help it if he could — could he be a sensible man ,  sir no ,  my dear ,  i think not .
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .
there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter ,  which promises well .
i am impatient to see him in point of composition ,  said mary ,  the letter does not seem defective .
the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new ,  yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia ,  neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat ,  and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .
as for their mother ,  mr. collinss letter had done away much of her illwill ,  and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters .
mr. collins was punctual to his time ,  and was received with great politeness by the whole family .
mr. bennet indeed said little ;  but the ladies were ready enough to talk ,  and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement ,  nor inclined to be silent himself .
he was a tall ,  heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty .
his air was grave and stately ,  and his manners were very formal .
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters ;  said he had heard much of their beauty ,  but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth ;  and added ,  that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage .
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ;  but mrs. bennet ,  who quarreled with no compliments ,  answered most readily .
you are very kind ,  i am sure ;  and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ,  for else they will be destitute enough .
things are settled so oddly you allude ,  perhaps ,  to the entail of this estate ah !
sir ,  i do indeed .
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls ,  you must confess .
not that i mean to find fault with you ,  for such things i know are all chance in this world .
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible ,  madam ,  of the hardship to my fair cousins ,  and could say much on the subject ,  but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .
at present i will not say more ;  but ,  perhaps ,  when we are better acquainted —  he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ;  and the girls smiled on each other .
they were not the only objects of mr. collinss admiration .
the hall ,  the diningroom ,  and all its furniture ,  were examined and praised ;  and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennets heart ,  but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ;  and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing .
but he was set right there by mrs. bennet ,  who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook ,  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
he begged pardon for having displeased her .
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ;  but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .
during dinner ,  mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all ;  but when the servants were withdrawn ,  he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest ,  and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine ,  by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .
lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes ,  and consideration for his comfort ,  appeared very remarkable .
mr. bennet could not have chosen better .
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise .
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner ,  and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank — such affability and condescension ,  as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings ,  and had sent for him only the saturday before ,  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew ,  but he had never seen anything but affability in her .
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ;  she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two ,  to visit his relations .
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could ,  provided he chose with discretion ;  and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ,  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making ,  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself — some shelves in the closet up stairs that is all very proper and civil ,  i am sure ,  said mrs. bennet ,  and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .
does she live near you ,  sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park ,  her ladyships residence i think you said she was a widow ,  sir ?
has she any family she has only one daughter ,  the heiress of rosings ,  and of very extensive property ah said mrs. bennet ,  shaking her head ,  then she is better off than many girls .
and what sort of young lady is she ?
is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed .
lady catherine herself says that ,  in point of true beauty ,  miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ,  because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth .
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution ,  which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of ,  as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education ,  and who still resides with them .
but she is perfectly amiable ,  and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies has she been presented ?
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ;  and by that means ,  as i told lady catherine one day ,  has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ;  and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .
i have more than once observed to lady catherine ,  that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ,  and that the most elevated rank ,  instead of giving her consequence ,  would be adorned by her .
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship ,  and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly ,  said mr. bennet ,  and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment ,  or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ,  and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions ,  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr. bennets expectations were fully answered .
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped ,  and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment ,  maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance ,  and ,  except in an occasional glance at elizabeth ,  requiring no partner in his pleasure .
by teatime ,  however ,  the dose had been enough ,  and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again ,  and ,  when tea was over ,  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .
mr. collins readily assented ,  and a book was produced ;  but ,  on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library ,  he started back ,  and begging pardon ,  protested that he never read novels .
kitty stared at him ,  and lydia exclaimed .
other books were produced ,  and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons .
lydia gaped as he opened the volume ,  and before he had ,  with very monotonous solemnity ,  read three pages ,  she interrupted him with :  do you know ,  mamma ,  that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard ;  and if he does ,  colonel forster will hire him .
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it ,  and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ;  but mr. collins ,  much offended ,  laid aside his book ,  and said :  i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp ,  though written solely for their benefit .
it amazes me ,  i confess ;  for ,  certainly ,  there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .
but i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr. bennet ,  he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .
mr. bennet accepted the challenge ,  observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption ,  and promised that it should not occur again ,  if he would resume his book ;  but mr. collins ,  after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill ,  and should never resent her behaviour as any affront ,  seated himself at another table with mr. bennet ,  and prepared for backgammon .
mr. collins was not a sensible man ,  and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ;  the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ;  and though he belonged to one of the universities ,  he had merely kept the necessary terms ,  without forming at it any useful acquaintance .
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ;  but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head ,  living in retirement ,  and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ;  and the respect which he felt for her high rank ,  and his veneration for her as his patroness ,  mingling with a very good opinion of himself ,  of his authority as a clergyman ,  and his right as a rector ,  made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness ,  selfimportance and humility .
having now a good house and a very sufficient income ,  he intended to marry ;  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view ,  as he meant to choose one of the daughters ,  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .
this was his plan of amends — of atonement — for inheriting their fathers estate ;  and he thought it an excellent one ,  full of eligibility and suitableness ,  and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .
his plan did not vary on seeing them .
miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views ,  and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ;  and for the first evening she was his settled choice .
the next morning ,  however ,  made an alteration ;  for in a quarter of an hours ttette with mrs. bennet before breakfast ,  a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse ,  and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes ,  that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn ,  produced from her ,  amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement ,  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .
as to her younger daughters ,  she could not take upon her to say — she could not positively answer — but she did not know of any prepossession ;  her eldest daughter ,  she must just mention — she felt it incumbent on her to hint ,  was likely to be very soon engaged mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth — and it was soon done — done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire .
elizabeth ,  equally next to jane in birth and beauty ,  succeeded her of course .
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint ,  and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ;  and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces .
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ;  every sister except mary agreed to go with her ;  and mr. collins was to attend them ,  at the request of mr. bennet ,  who was most anxious to get rid of him ,  and have his library to himself ;  for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast ;  and there he would continue ,  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection ,  but really talking to mr. bennet ,  with little cessation ,  of his house and garden at hunsford .
such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly .
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ;  and though prepared ,  as he told elizabeth ,  to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house ,  he was used to be free from them there ;  his civility ,  therefore ,  was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk ;  and mr. collins ,  being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader ,  was extremely pleased to close his large book ,  and go .
in pompous nothings on his side ,  and civil assents on that of his cousins ,  their time passed till they entered meryton .
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers ,  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed ,  or a really new muslin in a shop window ,  could recall them .
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man ,  whom they had never seen before ,  of most gentlemanlike appearance ,  walking with another officer on the other side of the way .
the officer was the very mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire ,  and he bowed as they passed .
all were struck with the strangers air ,  all wondered who he could be ;  and kitty and lydia ,  determined if possible to find out ,  led the way across the street ,  under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop ,  and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen ,  turning back ,  had reached the same spot .
mr. denny addressed them directly ,  and entreated permission to introduce his friend ,  mr. wickham ,  who had returned with him the day before from town ,  and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .
this was exactly as it should be ;  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .
his appearance was greatly in his favour ;  he had all the best part of beauty ,  a fine countenance ,  a good figure ,  and very pleasing address .
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation — a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ;  and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably ,  when the sound of horses drew their notice ,  and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .
on distinguishing the ladies of the group ,  the two gentlemen came directly towards them ,  and began the usual civilities .
bingley was the principal spokesman ,  and miss bennet the principal object .
he was then ,  he said ,  on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow ,  and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth ,  when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger ,  and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other ,  was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .
both changed colour ,  one looked white ,  the other red .
mr. wickham ,  after a few moments ,  touched his hat — a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return .
what could be the meaning of it ?
it was impossible to imagine ;  it was impossible not to long to know .
in another minute ,  mr. bingley ,  but without seeming to have noticed what passed ,  took leave and rode on with his friend .
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. phillips house ,  and then made their bows ,  in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in ,  and even in spite of mrs. phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation .
mrs. phillips was always glad to see her nieces ;  and the two eldest ,  from their recent absence ,  were particularly welcome ,  and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home ,  which ,  as their own carriage had not fetched them ,  she should have known nothing about ,  if she had not happened to see mr. joness shopboy in the street ,  who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away ,  when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by janes introduction of him .
she received him with her very best politeness ,  which he returned with as much more ,  apologising for his intrusion ,  without any previous acquaintance with her ,  which he could not help flattering himself ,  however ,  might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .
mrs. phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ;  but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other ;  of whom ,  however ,  she could only tell her nieces what they already knew ,  that mr. denny had brought him from london ,  and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the  —  — shire .
she had been watching him the last hour ,  she said ,  as he walked up and down the street ,  and had mr. wickham appeared ,  kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation ,  but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers ,  who ,  in comparison with the stranger ,  were become stupid ,  disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day ,  and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham ,  and give him an invitation also ,  if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .
this was agreed to ,  and mrs. phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets ,  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .
the prospect of such delights was very cheering ,  and they parted in mutual good spirits .
mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room ,  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .
as they walked home ,  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ;  but though jane would have defended either or both ,  had they appeared to be in the wrong ,  she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. phillipss manners and politeness .
he protested that ,  except lady catherine and her daughter ,  he had never seen a more elegant woman ;  for she had not only received him with the utmost civility ,  but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening ,  although utterly unknown to her before .
something ,  he supposed ,  might be attributed to his connection with them ,  but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt ,  and all mr. collinss scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted ,  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ;  and the girls had the pleasure of hearing ,  as they entered the drawingroom ,  that mr. wickham had accepted their uncles invitation ,  and was then in the house .
when this information was given ,  and they had all taken their seats ,  mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire ,  and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment ,  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ;  a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ;  but when mrs. phillips understood from him what rosings was ,  and who was its proprietor — when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms ,  and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds ,  she felt all the force of the compliment ,  and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room .
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion ,  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode ,  and the improvements it was receiving ,  he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ;  and he found in mrs. phillips a very attentive listener ,  whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard ,  and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .
to the girls ,  who could not listen to their cousin ,  and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument ,  and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece ,  the interval of waiting appeared very long .
it was over at last ,  however .
the gentlemen did approach ,  and when mr. wickham walked into the room ,  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before ,  nor thinking of him since ,  with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .
the officers of the  —  — shire were in general a very creditable ,  gentlemanlike set ,  and the best of them were of the present party ;  but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person ,  countenance ,  air ,  and walk ,  as they were superior to the broadfaced ,  stuffy uncle phillips ,  breathing port wine ,  who followed them into the room .
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned ,  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ;  and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation ,  though it was only on its being a wet night ,  made her feel that the commonest ,  dullest ,  most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers ,  mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance ;  to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ;  but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. phillips ,  and was by her watchfulness ,  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .
when the cardtables were placed ,  he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn ,  by sitting down to whist .
i know little of the game at present ,  said he ,  but i shall be glad to improve myself ,  for in my situation in life —  mrs. phillips was very glad for his compliance ,  but could not wait for his reason .
mr. wickham did not play at whist ,  and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely ,  for she was a most determined talker ;  but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets ,  she soon grew too much interested in the game ,  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular .
allowing for the common demands of the game ,  mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth ,  and she was very willing to hear him ,  though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told — the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy .
she dared not even mention that gentleman .
her curiosity ,  however ,  was unexpectedly relieved .
mr. wickham began the subject himself .
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ;  and ,  after receiving her answer ,  asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there .
about a month ,  said elizabeth ;  and then ,  unwilling to let the subject drop ,  added ,  he is a man of very large property in derbyshire ,  i understand yes ,  replied mr. wickham ;  his estate there is a noble one .
a clear ten thousand per annum .
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself ,  for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised .
you may well be surprised ,  miss bennet ,  at such an assertion ,  after seeing ,  as you probably might ,  the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .
are you much acquainted with mr. darcy as much as i ever wish to be ,  cried elizabeth very warmly .
i have spent four days in the same house with him ,  and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion ,  said wickham ,  as to his being agreeable or otherwise .
i am not qualified to form one .
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .
it is impossible for me to be impartial .
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish — and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .
here you are in your own family upon my word ,  i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood ,  except netherfield .
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .
everybody is disgusted with his pride .
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry ,  said wickham ,  after a short interruption ,  that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ;  but with him i believe it does not often happen .
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence ,  or frightened by his high and imposing manners ,  and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him ,  even on my slight acquaintance ,  to be an illtempered man wickham only shook his head .
i wonder ,  said he ,  at the next opportunity of speaking ,  whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know ;  but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .
i hope your plans in favour of the  —  — shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh !
no — it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy .
if he wishes to avoid seeing me ,  he must go .
we are not on friendly terms ,  and it always gives me pain to meet him ,  but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world ,  a sense of very great illusage ,  and most painful regrets at his being what he is .
his father ,  miss bennet ,  the late mr. darcy ,  was one of the best men that ever breathed ,  and the truest friend i ever had ;  and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ;  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything ,  rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase ,  and listened with all her heart ;  but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry .
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics ,  meryton ,  the neighbourhood ,  the society ,  appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen ,  and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .
it was the prospect of constant society ,  and good society ,  he added ,  which was my chief inducement to enter the  —  — shire .
i knew it to be a most respectable ,  agreeable corps ,  and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters ,  and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them .
society ,  i own ,  is necessary to me .
i have been a disappointed man ,  and my spirits will not bear solitude .
i must have employment and society .
a military life is not what i was intended for ,  but circumstances have now made it eligible .
the church ought to have been my profession — i was brought up for the church ,  and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living ,  had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yes — the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
he was my godfather ,  and excessively attached to me .
i cannot do justice to his kindness .
he meant to provide for me amply ,  and thought he had done it ;  but when the living fell ,  it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth ;  but how could that be ?
how could his will be disregarded ?
why did you not seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention ,  but mr. darcy chose to doubt it — or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation ,  and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance ,  imprudence — in short anything or nothing .
certain it is ,  that the living became vacant two years ago ,  exactly as i was of an age to hold it ,  and that it was given to another man ;  and no less certain is it ,  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it .
i have a warm ,  unguarded temper ,  and i may have spoken my opinion of him ,  and to him ,  too freely .
i can recall nothing worse .
but the fact is ,  that we are very different sort of men ,  and that he hates me this is quite shocking !
he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will be — but it shall not be by me .
till i can forget his father ,  i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings ,  and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
but what ,  said she ,  after a pause ,  can have been his motive ?
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough ,  determined dislike of me — a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .
had the late mr. darcy liked me less ,  his son might have borne with me better ;  but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him ,  i believe ,  very early in life .
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood — the sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this — though i have never liked him .
i had not thought so very ill of him .
i had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general ,  but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge ,  such injustice ,  such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection ,  however ,  she continued ,  i do remember his boasting one day ,  at netherfield ,  of the implacability of his resentments ,  of his having an unforgiving temper .
his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject ,  replied wickham ;  i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought ,  and after a time exclaimed ,  to treat in such a manner the godson ,  the friend ,  the favourite of his father she could have added ,  a young man ,  too ,  like you ,  whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable — but she contented herself with ,  and one ,  too ,  who had probably been his companion from childhood ,  connected together ,  as i think you said ,  in the closest manner we were born in the same parish ,  within the same park ;  the greatest part of our youth was passed together ;  inmates of the same house ,  sharing the same amusements ,  objects of the same parental care .
my father began life in the profession which your uncle ,  mr. phillips ,  appears to do so much credit to — but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy ,  a most intimate ,  confidential friend .
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence ,  and when ,  immediately before my fathers death ,  mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me ,  i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him ,  as of his affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth .
how abominable !
i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you !
if from no better motive ,  that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest — for dishonesty i must call it it is wonderful ,  replied wickham ,  for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ;  and pride had often been his best friend .
it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling .
but we are none of us consistent ,  and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes .
it has often led him to be liberal and generous ,  to give his money freely ,  to display hospitality ,  to assist his tenants ,  and relieve the poor .
family pride ,  and filial pride — for he is very proud of what his father was — have done this .
not to appear to disgrace his family ,  to degenerate from the popular qualities ,  or lose the influence of the pemberley house ,  is a powerful motive .
he has also brotherly pride ,  which ,  with some brotherly affection ,  makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ,  and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of girl is miss darcy he shook his head .
i wish i could call her amiable .
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .
but she is too much like her brother — very ,  very proud .
as a child ,  she was affectionate and pleasing ,  and extremely fond of me ;  and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .
but she is nothing to me now .
she is a handsome girl ,  about fifteen or sixteen ,  and ,  i understand ,  highly accomplished .
since her fathers death ,  her home has been london ,  where a lady lives with her ,  and superintends her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects ,  elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first ,  and saying :  i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley !
how can mr. bingley ,  who seems good humour itself ,  and is ,  i really believe ,  truly amiable ,  be in friendship with such a man ?
how can they suit each other ?
do you know mr. bingley not at all he is a sweettempered ,  amiable ,  charming man .
he cannot know what mr. darcy is probably not ;  but mr. darcy can please where he chooses .
he does not want abilities .
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .
among those who are at all his equals in consequence ,  he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .
his pride never deserts him ;  but with the rich he is liberalminded ,  just ,  sincere ,  rational ,  honourable ,  and perhaps agreeable — allowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up ,  the players gathered round the other table and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. phillips .
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .
it had not been very great ;  he had lost every point ;  but when mrs. phillips began to express her concern thereupon ,  he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance ,  that he considered the money as a mere trifle ,  and begged that she would not make herself uneasy .
i know very well ,  madam ,  said he ,  that when persons sit down to a cardtable ,  they must take their chances of these things ,  and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same ,  but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh ,  i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr. wickhams attention was caught ;  and after observing mr. collins for a few moments ,  he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .
lady catherine de bourgh ,  she replied ,  has very lately given him a living .
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice ,  but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ;  consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy no ,  indeed ,  i did not .
i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections .
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter ,  miss de bourgh ,  will have a very large fortune ,  and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile ,  as she thought of poor miss bingley .
vain indeed must be all her attentions ,  vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself ,  if he were already selfdestined for another .
mr .
collins ,  said she ,  speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ;  but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship ,  i suspect his gratitude misleads him ,  and that in spite of her being his patroness ,  she is an arrogant ,  conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree ,  replied wickham ;  i have not seen her for many years ,  but i very well remember that i never liked her ,  and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ;  but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune ,  part from her authoritative manner ,  and the rest from the pride for her nephew ,  who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it ,  and they continued talking together ,  with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ,  and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickhams attentions .
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. phillipss supper party ,  but his manners recommended him to everybody .
whatever he said ,  was said well ;  and whatever he did ,  done gracefully .
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham ,  and of what he had told her ,  all the way home ;  but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went ,  for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets ,  of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won ;  and mr. collins in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. phillips ,  protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist ,  enumerating all the dishes at supper ,  and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins ,  had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .
jane listened with astonishment and concern ;  she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingleys regard ;  and yet ,  it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .
the possibility of his having endured such unkindness ,  was enough to interest all her tender feelings ;  and nothing remained therefore to be done ,  but to think well of them both ,  to defend the conduct of each ,  and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained .
they have both ,  said she ,  been deceived ,  i dare say ,  in some way or other ,  of which we can form no idea .
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .
it is ,  in short ,  impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them ,  without actual blame on either side very true ,  indeed ;  and now ,  my dear jane ,  what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
do clear them too ,  or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you choose ,  but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .
my dearest lizzy ,  do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy ,  to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner ,  one whom his father had promised to provide for .
it is impossible .
no man of common humanity ,  no man who had any value for his character ,  could be capable of it .
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?
oh !
no i can much more easily believe mr. bingleys being imposed on ,  than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ;  names ,  facts ,  everything mentioned without ceremony .
if it be not so ,  let mr. darcy contradict it .
besides ,  there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed — it is distressing .
one does not know what to think i beg your pardon ;  one knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point — that mr. bingley ,  if he had been imposed on ,  would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery ,  where this conversation passed ,  by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ;  mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield ,  which was fixed for the following tuesday .
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again ,  called it an age since they had met ,  and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ;  avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible ,  saying not much to elizabeth ,  and nothing at all to the others .
they were soon gone again ,  rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise ,  and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennets civilities .
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter ,  and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself ,  instead of a ceremonious card .
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends ,  and the attentions of their brother ;  and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham ,  and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcys look and behaviour .
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event ,  or any particular person ,  for though they each ,  like elizabeth ,  meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham ,  he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them ,  and a ball was ,  at any rate ,  a ball .
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
while i can have my mornings to myself ,  said she ,  it is enough — i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
society has claims on us all ;  and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion ,  that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins ,  she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingleys invitation ,  and if he did ,  whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement ;  and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head ,  and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop ,  or lady catherine de bourgh ,  by venturing to dance .
i am by no means of the opinion ,  i assure you ,  said he ,  that a ball of this kind ,  given by a young man of character ,  to respectable people ,  can have any evil tendency ;  and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself ,  that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ;  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours ,  miss elizabeth ,  for the two first dances especially ,  a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause ,  and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
she had fully proposed being engaged by mr. wickham for those very dances ;  and to have mr. collins instead !
her liveliness had never been worse timed .
there was no help for it ,  however .
mr. wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer ,  and mr. collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more .
it now first struck her ,  that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage ,  and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings ,  in the absence of more eligible visitors .
the idea soon reached to conviction ,  as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself ,  and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ;  and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms ,  it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her .
elizabeth ,  however ,  did not choose to take the hint ,  being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
mr. collins might never make the offer ,  and till he did ,  it was useless to quarrel about him .
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of ,  the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time ,  for from the day of the invitation ,  to the day of the ball ,  there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .
no aunt ,  no officers ,  no news could be sought after — the very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy .
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ;  and nothing less than a dance on tuesday ,  could have made such a friday ,  saturday ,  sunday ,  and monday endurable to kitty and lydia .
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield ,  and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled ,  a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
she had dressed with more than usual care ,  and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart ,  trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers ;  and though this was not exactly the case ,  the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny ,  to whom lydia eagerly applied ,  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before ,  and was not yet returned ;  adding ,  with a significant smile ,  i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now ,  if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence ,  though unheard by lydia ,  was caught by elizabeth ,  and ,  as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just ,  every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment ,  that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .
attendance ,  forbearance ,  patience with darcy ,  was injury to wickham .
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him ,  and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley ,  whose blind partiality provoked her .
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour ;  and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening ,  it could not dwell long on her spirits ;  and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas ,  whom she had not seen for a week ,  she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin ,  and to point him out to her particular notice .
the first two dances ,  however ,  brought a return of distress ;  they were dances of mortification .
mr. collins ,  awkward and solemn ,  apologising instead of attending ,  and often moving wrong without being aware of it ,  gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .
the moment of her release from him was ecstasy .
she danced next with an officer ,  and had the refreshment of talking of wickham ,  and of hearing that he was universally liked .
when those dances were over ,  she returned to charlotte lucas ,  and was in conversation with her ,  when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand ,  that ,  without knowing what she did ,  she accepted him .
he walked away again immediately ,  and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ;  charlotte tried to console her :  i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid !
that would be the greatest misfortune of all !
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced ,  however ,  and darcy approached to claim her hand ,  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper ,  not to be a simpleton ,  and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence .
elizabeth made no answer ,  and took her place in the set ,  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy ,  and reading in her neighbours looks ,  their equal amazement in beholding it .
they stood for some time without speaking a word ;  and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances ,  and at first was resolved not to break it ;  till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk ,  she made some slight observation on the dance .
he replied ,  and was again silent .
after a pause of some minutes ,  she addressed him a second time with :  — it is your turn to say something now ,  mr. darcy .
i talked about the dance ,  and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room ,  or the number of couples he smiled ,  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
very well .
that reply will do for the present .
perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .
but now we may be silent do you talk by rule ,  then ,  while you are dancing sometimes .
one must speak a little ,  you know .
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ;  and yet for the advantage of some ,  conversation ought to be so arranged ,  as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case ,  or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both ,  replied elizabeth archly ;  for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
we are each of an unsocial ,  taciturn disposition ,  unwilling to speak ,  unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room ,  and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character ,  i am sure ,  said he .
how near it may be to mine ,  i cannot pretend to say .
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer ,  and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance ,  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .
she answered in the affirmative ,  and ,  unable to resist the temptation ,  added ,  when you met us there the other day ,  we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate .
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features ,  but he said not a word ,  and elizabeth ,  though blaming herself for her own weakness ,  could not go on .
at length darcy spoke ,  and in a constrained manner said ,  mr .
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends — whether he may be equally capable of retaining them ,  is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship ,  replied elizabeth with emphasis ,  and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer ,  and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
at that moment ,  sir william lucas appeared close to them ,  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ;  but on perceiving mr. darcy ,  he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .
i have been most highly gratified indeed ,  my dear sir .
such very superior dancing is not often seen .
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .
allow me to say ,  however ,  that your fair partner does not disgrace you ,  and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated ,  especially when a certain desirable event ,  my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place .
what congratulations will then flow in !
i appeal to mr. darcy :  — but let me not interrupt you ,  sir .
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady ,  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ;  but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly ,  and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane ,  who were dancing together .
recovering himself ,  however ,  shortly ,  he turned to his partner ,  and said ,  sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all .
sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
we have tried two or three subjects already without success ,  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he ,  smiling .
books — oh !
no .
i am sure we never read the same ,  or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so ;  but if that be the case ,  there can at least be no want of subject .
we may compare our different opinions no — i cannot talk of books in a ballroom ;  my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenes — does it said he ,  with a look of doubt .
yes ,  always ,  she replied ,  without knowing what she said ,  for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject ,  as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming ,  i remember hearing you once say ,  mr. darcy ,  that you hardly ever forgave ,  that your resentment once created was unappeasable .
you are very cautious ,  i suppose ,  as to its being created i am ,  said he ,  with a firm voice .
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion ,  to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of your character ,  said she ,  endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head .
i do not get on at all .
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe ,  answered he gravely ,  that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ;  and i could wish ,  miss bennet ,  that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment ,  as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now ,  i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours ,  he coldly replied .
she said no more ,  and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ;  and on each side dissatisfied ,  though not to an equal degree ,  for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her ,  which soon procured her pardon ,  and directed all his anger against another .
they had not long separated ,  when miss bingley came towards her ,  and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her :  so ,  miss eliza ,  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !
your sister has been talking to me about him ,  and asking me a thousand questions ;  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you ,  among his other communication ,  that he was the son of old wickham ,  the late mr. darcys steward .
let me recommend you ,  however ,  as a friend ,  not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ;  for as to mr. darcys using him ill ,  it is perfectly false ;  for ,  on the contrary ,  he has always been remarkably kind to him ,  though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .
i do not know the particulars ,  but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame ,  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned ,  and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers ,  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing ,  indeed ,  and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
i pity you ,  miss eliza ,  for this discovery of your favourites guilt ;  but really ,  considering his descent ,  one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same ,  said elizabeth angrily ;  for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcys steward ,  and of that ,  i can assure you ,  he informed me himself i beg your pardon ,  replied miss bingley ,  turning away with a sneer .
excuse my interference — it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself .
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy she then sought her eldest sister ,  who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency ,  a glow of such happy expression ,  as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .
elizabeth instantly read her feelings ,  and at that moment solicitude for wickham ,  resentment against his enemies ,  and everything else ,  gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness .
i want to know ,  said she ,  with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters ,  what you have learnt about mr. wickham .
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ;  in which case you may be sure of my pardon no ,  replied jane ,  i have not forgotten him ;  but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history ,  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ;  but he will vouch for the good conduct ,  the probity ,  and honour of his friend ,  and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ;  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters ,  mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
i am afraid he has been very imprudent ,  and has deserved to lose mr. darcys regard mr .
bingley does not know mr. wickham himself no ;  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .
i am satisfied .
but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances ,  though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once ,  but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not a doubt of mr. bingleys sincerity ,  said elizabeth warmly ;  but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
mr. bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one ,  i dare say ;  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story ,  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself ,  i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each ,  and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy ,  though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr. bingleys regard ,  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself ,  elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ;  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied ,  before mr. collins came up to them ,  and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .
i have found out ,  said he ,  by a singular accident ,  that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh ,  and of her mother lady catherine .
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !
who would have thought of my meeting with ,  perhaps ,  a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him ,  which i am now going to do ,  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy indeed i am .
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew .
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ,  assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom ,  rather than a compliment to his aunt ;  that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ;  and that if it were ,  it must belong to mr. darcy ,  the superior in consequence ,  to begin the acquaintance .
mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination ,  and ,  when she ceased speaking ,  replied thus :  my dear miss elizabeth ,  i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ;  but permit me to say ,  that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity ,  and those which regulate the clergy ;  for ,  give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom — provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion ,  which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice ,  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide ,  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy ,  whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched ,  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it ,  she felt as if hearing it all ,  and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology ,  hunsford ,  and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder ,  and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak ,  replied with an air of distant civility .
mr. collins ,  however ,  was not discouraged from speaking again ,  and mr. darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech ,  and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow ,  and moved another way .
mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .
i have no reason ,  i assure you ,  said he ,  to be dissatisfied with my reception .
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
he answered me with the utmost civility ,  and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .
it was really a very handsome thought .
upon the whole ,  i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue ,  she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley ;  and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to ,  made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .
she saw her in idea settled in that very house ,  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ;  and she felt capable ,  under such circumstances ,  of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters .
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way ,  and she determined not to venture near her ,  lest she might hear too much .
when they sat down to supper ,  therefore ,  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ;  and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely ,  openly ,  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr. bingley .
it was an animating subject ,  and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .
his being such a charming young man ,  and so rich ,  and living but three miles from them ,  were the first points of selfgratulation ;  and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane ,  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .
it was ,  moreover ,  such a promising thing for her younger daughters ,  as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ;  and lastly ,  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister ,  that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure ,  because on such occasions it is the etiquette ;  but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life .
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate ,  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words ,  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ;  for ,  to her inexpressible vexation ,  she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy ,  who sat opposite to them .
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
what is mr. darcy to me ,  pray ,  that i should be afraid of him ?
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heavens sake ,  madam ,  speak lower .
what advantage can it be for you to offend mr. darcy ?
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say ,  however ,  had any influence .
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy ,  though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ;  for though he was not always looking at her mother ,  she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .
at length ,  however ,  mrs. bennet had no more to say ;  and lady lucas ,  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing ,  was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .
elizabeth now began to revive .
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ;  for ,  when supper was over ,  singing was talked of ,  and she had the mortification of seeing mary ,  after very little entreaty ,  preparing to oblige the company .
by many significant looks and silent entreaties ,  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance ,  but in vain ;  mary would not understand them ;  such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her ,  and she began her song .
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ,  and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ;  for mary ,  on receiving ,  amongst the thanks of the table ,  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again ,  after the pause of half a minute began another .
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display ;  her voice was weak ,  and her manner affected .
elizabeth was in agonies .
she looked at jane ,  to see how she bore it ;  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .
she looked at his two sisters ,  and saw them making signs of derision at each other ,  and at darcy ,  who continued ,  however ,  imperturbably grave .
she looked at her father to entreat his interference ,  lest mary should be singing all night .
he took the hint ,  and when mary had finished her second song ,  said aloud ,  that will do extremely well ,  child .
you have delighted us long enough .
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary ,  though pretending not to hear ,  was somewhat disconcerted ;  and elizabeth ,  sorry for her ,  and sorry for her fathers speech ,  was afraid her anxiety had done no good .
others of the party were now applied to .
if i ,  said mr. collins ,  were so fortunate as to be able to sing ,  i should have great pleasure ,  i am sure ,  in obliging the company with an air ;  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion ,  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .
i do not mean ,  however ,  to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music ,  for there are certainly other things to be attended to .
the rector of a parish has much to do .
in the first place ,  he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .
he must write his own sermons ;  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties ,  and the care and improvement of his dwelling ,  which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody ,  especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .
i cannot acquit him of that duty ;  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr. darcy ,  he concluded his speech ,  which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .
many stared — many smiled ;  but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself ,  while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly ,  and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas ,  that he was a remarkably clever ,  good kind of young man .
to elizabeth it appeared that ,  had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening ,  it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ;  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice ,  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .
that his two sisters and mr. darcy ,  however ,  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations ,  was bad enough ,  and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman ,  or the insolent smiles of the ladies ,  were more intolerable .
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
she was teased by mr. collins ,  who continued most perseveringly by her side ,  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again ,  put it out of her power to dance with others .
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else ,  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
he assured her ,  that as to dancing ,  he was perfectly indifferent to it ;  that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .
there was no arguing upon such a project .
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas ,  who often joined them ,  and goodnaturedly engaged mr. collinss conversation to herself .
she was at least free from the offense of mr. darcys further notice ;  though often standing within a very short distance of her ,  quite disengaged ,  he never came near enough to speak .
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham ,  and rejoiced in it .
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ,  and ,  by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet ,  had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone ,  which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .
mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths ,  except to complain of fatigue ,  and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .
they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation ,  and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party ,  which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins ,  who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment ,  and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .
darcy said nothing at all .
mr. bennet ,  in equal silence ,  was enjoying the scene .
mr. bingley and jane were standing together ,  a little detached from the rest ,  and talked only to each other .
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ;  and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord ,  how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn .
when at length they arose to take leave ,  mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ,  and addressed herself especially to mr. bingley ,  to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time ,  without the ceremony of a formal invitation .
bingley was all grateful pleasure ,  and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her ,  after his return from london ,  whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ,  and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that ,  allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements ,  new carriages ,  and wedding clothes ,  she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months .
of having another daughter married to mr. collins ,  she thought with equal certainty ,  and with considerable ,  though not equal ,  pleasure .
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ;  and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her ,  the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .
mr. collins made his declaration in form .
having resolved to do it without loss of time ,  as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday ,  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment ,  he set about it in a very orderly manner ,  with all the observances ,  which he supposed a regular part of the business .
on finding mrs. bennet ,  elizabeth ,  and one of the younger girls together ,  soon after breakfast ,  he addressed the mother in these words :  may i hope ,  madam ,  for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth ,  when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise ,  mrs. bennet answered instantly ,  oh dear — yes — certainly .
i am sure lizzy will be very happy — i am sure she can have no objection .
come ,  kitty ,  i want you up stairs and ,  gathering her work together ,  she was hastening away ,  when elizabeth called out :  dear madam ,  do not go .
i beg you will not go .
mr. collins must excuse me .
he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear .
i am going away myself no ,  no ,  nonsense ,  lizzy .
i desire you to stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really ,  with vexed and embarrassed looks ,  about to escape ,  she added :  lizzy ,  i insist upon your staying and hearing mr. collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction — and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible ,  she sat down again and tried to conceal ,  by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off ,  and as soon as they were gone ,  mr. collins began .
believe me ,  my dear miss elizabeth ,  that your modesty ,  so far from doing you any disservice ,  rather adds to your other perfections .
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ;  but allow me to assure you ,  that i have your respected mothers permission for this address .
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse ,  however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ;  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
almost as soon as i entered the house ,  i singled you out as the companion of my future life .
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject ,  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying — and ,  moreover ,  for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife ,  as i certainly did the idea of mr. collins ,  with all his solemn composure ,  being run away with by his feelings ,  made elizabeth so near laughing ,  that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further ,  and he continued :  my reasons for marrying are ,  first ,  that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish ;  secondly ,  that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ;  and thirdly — which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier ,  that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject ;  and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford — between our pools at quadrille ,  while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool ,  that she said ,  mr .
collins ,  you must marry .
a clergyman like you must marry .
choose properly ,  choose a gentlewoman for my sake ;  and for your own ,  let her be an active ,  useful sort of person ,  not brought up high ,  but able to make a small income go a good way .
this is my advice .
find such a woman as soon as you can ,  bring her to hunsford ,  and i will visit her allow me ,  by the way ,  to observe ,  my fair cousin ,  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .
you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe ;  and your wit and vivacity ,  i think ,  must be acceptable to her ,  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ;  it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood ,  where i can assure you there are many amiable young women .
but the fact is ,  that being ,  as i am ,  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who ,  however ,  may live many years longer ,  i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters ,  that the loss to them might be as little as possible ,  when the melancholy event takes place — which ,  however ,  as i have already said ,  may not be for several years .
this has been my motive ,  my fair cousin ,  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent ,  and shall make no demand of that nature on your father ,  since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ;  and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents ,  which will not be yours till after your mothers decease ,  is all that you may ever be entitled to .
on that head ,  therefore ,  i shall be uniformly silent ;  and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
you are too hasty ,  sir ,  she cried .
you forget that i have made no answer .
let me do it without further loss of time .
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals ,  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them i am not now to learn ,  replied mr. collins ,  with a formal wave of the hand ,  that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept ,  when he first applies for their favour ;  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second ,  or even a third time .
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said ,  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word ,  sir ,  cried elizabeth ,  your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration .
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .
you could not make me happy ,  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so .
nay ,  were your friend lady catherine to know me ,  i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so ,  said mr. collins very gravely — but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .
and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again ,  i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty ,  economy ,  and other amiable qualification indeed ,  mr. collins ,  all praise of me will be unnecessary .
you must give me leave to judge for myself ,  and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .
i wish you very happy and very rich ,  and by refusing your hand ,  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .
in making me the offer ,  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family ,  and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls ,  without any selfreproach .
this matter may be considered ,  therefore ,  as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke ,  she would have quitted the room ,  had mr. collins not thus addressed her :  when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject ,  i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ;  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present ,  because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application ,  and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really ,  mr. collins ,  cried elizabeth with some warmth ,  you puzzle me exceedingly .
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement ,  i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself ,  my dear cousin ,  that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
my reasons for believing it are briefly these :  it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance ,  or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .
my situation in life ,  my connections with the family of de bourgh ,  and my relationship to your own ,  are circumstances highly in my favour ;  and you should take it into further consideration ,  that in spite of your manifold attractions ,  it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me ,  i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense ,  according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you ,  sir ,  that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals ,  but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
my feelings in every respect forbid it .
can i speak plainer ?
do not consider me now as an elegant female ,  intending to plague you ,  but as a rational creature ,  speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he ,  with an air of awkward gallantry ;  and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents ,  my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply ,  and immediately and in silence withdrew ;  determined ,  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement ,  to apply to her father ,  whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive ,  and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ;  for mrs. bennet ,  having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference ,  no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase ,  than she entered the breakfastroom ,  and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .
mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure ,  and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview ,  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied ,  since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .
this information ,  however ,  startled mrs. bennet ;  she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals ,  but she dared not believe it ,  and could not help saying so .
but ,  depend upon it ,  mr. collins ,  she added ,  that lizzy shall be brought to reason .
i will speak to her about it directly .
she is a very headstrong ,  foolish girl ,  and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you ,  madam ,  cried mr. collins ;  but if she is really headstrong and foolish ,  i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation ,  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit ,  perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me ,  because if liable to such defects of temper ,  she could not contribute much to my felicity sir ,  you quite misunderstand me ,  said mrs. bennet ,  alarmed .
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived .
i will go directly to mr. bennet ,  and we shall very soon settle it with her ,  i am sure she would not give him time to reply ,  but hurrying instantly to her husband ,  called out as she entered the library ,  oh !
mr. bennet ,  you are wanted immediately ;  we are all in an uproar .
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins ,  for she vows she will not have him ,  and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered ,  and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
i have not the pleasure of understanding you ,  said he ,  when she had finished her speech .
of what are you talking of mr. collins and lizzy .
lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins ,  and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion ?
it seems an hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself .
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him let her be called down .
she shall hear my opinion mrs. bennet rang the bell ,  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .
come here ,  child ,  cried her father as she appeared .
i have sent for you on an affair of importance .
i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .
is it true elizabeth replied that it was .
very well — and this offer of marriage you have refused i have ,  sir very well .
we now come to the point .
your mother insists upon your accepting it .
is it not so ,  mrs. bennet yes ,  or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you ,  elizabeth .
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins ,  and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ,  but mrs. bennet ,  who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished ,  was excessively disappointed .
what do you mean ,  mr. bennet ,  in talking this way ?
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him my dear ,  replied her husband ,  i have two small favours to request .
first ,  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ;  and secondly ,  of my room .
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet ,  however ,  in spite of her disappointment in her husband ,  did mrs. bennet give up the point .
she talked to elizabeth again and again ;  coaxed and threatened her by turns .
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest ;  but jane ,  with all possible mildness ,  declined interfering ;  and elizabeth ,  sometimes with real earnestness ,  and sometimes with playful gaiety ,  replied to her attacks .
though her manner varied ,  however ,  her determination never did .
mr. collins ,  meanwhile ,  was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him ;  and though his pride was hurt ,  he suffered in no other way .
his regard for her was quite imaginary ;  and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
while the family were in this confusion ,  charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
she was met in the vestibule by lydia ,  who ,  flying to her ,  cried in a half whisper ,  i am glad you are come ,  for there is such fun here !
what do you think has happened this morning ?
mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy ,  and she will not have him charlotte hardly had time to answer ,  before they were joined by kitty ,  who came to tell the same news ;  and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom ,  where mrs. bennet was alone ,  than she likewise began on the subject ,  calling on miss lucas for her compassion ,  and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .
pray do ,  my dear miss lucas ,  she added in a melancholy tone ,  for nobody is on my side ,  nobody takes part with me .
i am cruelly used ,  nobody feels for my poor nerves charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
aye ,  there she comes ,  continued mrs. bennet ,  looking as unconcerned as may be ,  and caring no more for us than if we were at york ,  provided she can have her own way .
but i tell you ,  miss lizzy — if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way ,  you will never get a husband at all — and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .
i shall not be able to keep you — and so i warn you .
i have done with you from this very day .
i told you in the library ,  you know ,  that i should never speak to you again ,  and you will find me as good as my word .
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
not that i have much pleasure ,  indeed ,  in talking to anybody .
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
nobody can tell what i suffer !
but it is always so .
those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion ,  sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation .
she talked on ,  therefore ,  without interruption from any of them ,  till they were joined by mr. collins ,  who entered the room with an air more stately than usual ,  and on perceiving whom ,  she said to the girls ,  now ,  i do insist upon it ,  that you ,  all of you ,  hold your tongues ,  and let me and mr. collins have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room ,  jane and kitty followed ,  but lydia stood her ground ,  determined to hear all she could ;  and charlotte ,  detained first by the civility of mr. collins ,  whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute ,  and then by a little curiosity ,  satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet began the projected conversation :  oh !
mr. collins my dear madam ,  replied he ,  let us be for ever silent on this point .
far be it from me ,  he presently continued ,  in a voice that marked his displeasure ,  to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ;  the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ;  and i trust i am resigned .
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ;  for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
you will not ,  i hope ,  consider me as showing any disrespect to your family ,  my dear madam ,  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour ,  without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
my conduct may ,  i fear ,  be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own .
but we are all liable to error .
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself ,  with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ,  and if my manner has been at all reprehensible ,  i here beg leave to apologise the discussion of mr. collinss offer was now nearly at an end ,  and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it ,  and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother .
as for the gentleman himself ,  his feelings were chiefly expressed ,  not by embarrassment or dejection ,  or by trying to avoid her ,  but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .
he scarcely ever spoke to her ,  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas ,  whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all ,  and especially to her friend .
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennets illhumour or ill health .
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit ,  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .
he was always to have gone on saturday ,  and to saturday he meant to stay .
after breakfast ,  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned ,  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .
he joined them on their entering the town ,  and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation ,  and the concern of everybody ,  was well talked over .
to elizabeth ,  however ,  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed .
i found ,  said he ,  as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr. darcy ;  that to be in the same room ,  the same party with him for so many hours together ,  might be more than i could bear ,  and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance ,  and they had leisure for a full discussion of it ,  and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other ,  as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn ,  and during the walk he particularly attended to her .
his accompanying them was a double advantage ;  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself ,  and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .
soon after their return ,  a letter was delivered to miss bennet ;  it came from netherfield .
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant ,  little ,  hotpressed paper ,  well covered with a ladys fair ,  flowing hand ;  and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it ,  and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .
jane recollected herself soon ,  and putting the letter away ,  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ;  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ;  and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave ,  than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .
when they had gained their own room ,  jane ,  taking out the letter ,  said :  this is from caroline bingley ;  what it contains has surprised me a good deal .
the whole party have left netherfield by this time ,  and are on their way to town — and without any intention of coming back again .
you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud ,  which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly ,  and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street ,  where mr. hurst had a house .
the next was in these words :  i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire ,  except your society ,  my dearest friend ;  but we will hope ,  at some future period ,  to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known ,  and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .
i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ;  and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her ,  she saw nothing in it really to lament ;  it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingleys being there ;  and as to the loss of their society ,  she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it ,  in the enjoyment of his .
it is unlucky ,  said she ,  after a short pause ,  that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware ,  and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?
mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .
i will read it to you :  when my brother left us yesterday ,  he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days ;  but as we are certain it cannot be so ,  and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again ,  we have determined on following him thither ,  that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .
many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter ;  i wish that i could hear that you ,  my dearest friend ,  had any intention of making one of the crowd — but of that i despair .
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings ,  and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this ,  added jane ,  that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should why will you think so ?
it must be his own doing .
he is his own master .
but you do not know all .
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
i will have no reserves from you mr .
darcy is impatient to see his sister ;  and ,  to confess the truth ,  we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty ,  elegance ,  and accomplishments ;  and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting ,  from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister .
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject ;  but i will not leave the country without confiding them ,  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .
my brother admires her greatly already ;  he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ;  her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ;  and a sisters partiality is not misleading me ,  i think ,  when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart .
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment ,  and nothing to prevent it ,  am i wrong ,  my dearest jane ,  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what do you think of this sentence ,  my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it .
is it not clear enough ?
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ;  that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference ;  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him ,  she means most kindly to put me on my guard ?
can there be any other opinion on the subject yes ,  there can ;  for mine is totally different .
will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words .
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you ,  and wants him to marry miss darcy .
she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there ,  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head .
indeed ,  jane ,  you ought to believe me .
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection .
miss bingley ,  i am sure ,  cannot .
she is not such a simpleton .
could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself ,  she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
but the case is this :  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ;  and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother ,  from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage ,  she may have less trouble in achieving a second ;  in which there is certainly some ingenuity ,  and i dare say it would succeed ,  if miss de bourgh were out of the way .
but ,  my dearest jane ,  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy ,  he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday ,  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that ,  instead of being in love with you ,  he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley ,  replied jane ,  your representation of all this might make me quite easy .
but i know the foundation is unjust .
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ;  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself that is right .
you could not have started a more happy idea ,  since you will not take comfort in mine .
believe her to be deceived ,  by all means .
you have now done your duty by her ,  and must fret no longer but ,  my dear sister ,  can i be happy ,  even supposing the best ,  in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself ,  said elizabeth ;  and if ,  upon mature deliberation ,  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife ,  i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane ,  faintly smiling .
you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation ,  i could not hesitate i did not think you would ;  and that being the case ,  i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter ,  my choice will never be required .
a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes ,  and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes ,  however openly or artfully spoken ,  could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone .
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject ,  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
janes temper was not desponding ,  and she was gradually led to hope ,  though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope ,  that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family ,  without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct ;  but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern ,  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .
after lamenting it ,  however ,  at some length ,  she had the consolation that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn ,  and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration ,  that though he had been invited only to a family dinner ,  she would take care to have two full courses .
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .
it keeps him in good humour ,  said she ,  and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful ,  and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .
this was very amiable ,  but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ;  its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr. collinss addresses ,  by engaging them towards herself .
such was miss lucass scheme ;  and appearances were so favourable ,  that when they parted at night ,  she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character ,  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness ,  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins ,  from a conviction that if they saw him depart ,  they could not fail to conjecture his design ,  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise ;  for though feeling almost secure ,  and with reason ,  for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging ,  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .
his reception ,  however ,  was of the most flattering kind .
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house ,  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .
in as short a time as mr. collinss long speeches would allow ,  everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ;  and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ;  and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present ,  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ;  and miss lucas ,  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment ,  cared not how soon that establishment were gained .
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ;  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .
mr. collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter ,  to whom they could give little fortune ;  and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .
lady lucas began directly to calculate ,  with more interest than the matter had ever excited before ,  how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ;  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion ,  that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate ,  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st .
jamess .
the whole family ,  in short ,  were properly overjoyed on the occasion .
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ;  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid .
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .
she had gained her point ,  and had time to consider of it .
her reflections were in general satisfactory .
mr. collins ,  to be sure ,  was neither sensible nor agreeable ;  his society was irksome ,  and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
but still he would be her husband .
without thinking highly either of men or matrimony ,  marriage had always been her object ;  it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune ,  and however uncertain of giving happiness ,  must be their pleasantest preservative from want .
this preservative she had now obtained ;  and at the age of twentyseven ,  without having ever been handsome ,  she felt all the good luck of it .
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet ,  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
elizabeth would wonder ,  and probably would blame her ;  and though her resolution was not to be shaken ,  her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation .
she resolved to give her the information herself ,  and therefore charged mr. collins ,  when he returned to longbourn to dinner ,  to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given ,  but it could not be kept without difficulty ;  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade ,  and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial ,  for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family ,  the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ;  and mrs. bennet ,  with great politeness and cordiality ,  said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again ,  whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them .
my dear madam ,  he replied ,  this invitation is particularly gratifying ,  because it is what i have been hoping to receive ;  and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished ;  and mr. bennet ,  who could by no means wish for so speedy a return ,  immediately said :  but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here ,  my good sir ?
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir ,  replied mr. collins ,  i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution ,  and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence you cannot be too much upon your guard .
risk anything rather than her displeasure ;  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again ,  which i should think exceedingly probable ,  stay quietly at home ,  and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me ,  my dear sir ,  my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ;  and depend upon it ,  you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this ,  and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .
as for my fair cousins ,  though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary ,  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness ,  not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ;  all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return .
mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls ,  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ;  there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her ,  and though by no means so clever as herself ,  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers ,  he might become a very agreeable companion .
but on the following morning ,  every hope of this kind was done away .
miss lucas called soon after breakfast ,  and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
the possibility of mr. collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ;  but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself ,  and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum ,  and she could not help crying out :  engaged to mr. collins !
my dear charlotte — impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story ,  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ;  though ,  as it was no more than she expected ,  she soon regained her composure ,  and calmly replied :  why should you be surprised ,  my dear eliza ?
do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion ,  because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself ,  and making a strong effort for it ,  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her ,  and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .
i see what you are feeling ,  replied charlotte .
you must be surprised ,  very much surprised — so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .
but when you have had time to think it over ,  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .
i am not romantic ,  you know ;  i never was .
i ask only a comfortable home ;  and considering mr. collinss character ,  connection ,  and situation in life ,  i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly ;  and after an awkward pause ,  they returned to the rest of the family .
charlotte did not stay much longer ,  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .
the strangeness of mr. collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own ,  but she had not supposed it to be possible that ,  when called into action ,  she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .
charlotte the wife of mr. collins was a most humiliating picture !
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem ,  was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters ,  reflecting on what she had heard ,  and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it ,  when sir william lucas himself appeared ,  sent by his daughter ,  to announce her engagement to the family .
with many compliments to them ,  and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses ,  he unfolded the matter — to an audience not merely wondering ,  but incredulous ;  for mrs. bennet ,  with more perseverance than politeness ,  protested he must be entirely mistaken ;  and lydia ,  always unguarded and often uncivil ,  boisterously exclaimed :  good lord !
sir william ,  how can you tell such a story ?
do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ;  but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all ;  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information ,  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .
elizabeth ,  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation ,  now put herself forward to confirm his account ,  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ;  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william ,  in which she was readily joined by jane ,  and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match ,  the excellent character of mr. collins ,  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ;  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .
in the first place ,  she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ;  secondly ,  she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ;  thirdly ,  she trusted that they would never be happy together ;  and fourthly ,  that the match might be broken off .
two inferences ,  however ,  were plainly deduced from the whole :  one ,  that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ;  and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all ;  and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .
nothing could console and nothing could appease her .
nor did that day wear out her resentment .
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her ,  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude ,  and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .
mr. bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion ,  and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ;  for it gratified him ,  he said ,  to discover that charlotte lucas ,  whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible ,  was as foolish as his wife ,  and more foolish than his daughter !
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ;  but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ;  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas ,  for mr. collins was only a clergyman ;  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ;  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was ,  though mrs. bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ;  and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister ,  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken ,  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious ,  as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter ,  and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday ,  addressed to their father ,  and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted .
after discharging his conscience on that head ,  he proceeded to inform them ,  with many rapturous expressions ,  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour ,  miss lucas ,  and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn ,  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ;  for lady catherine ,  he added ,  so heartily approved his marriage ,  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible ,  which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .
mr. collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .
on the contrary ,  she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ;  it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent ,  and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet ,  and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingleys continued absence .
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ;  a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet ,  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .
even elizabeth began to fear — not that bingley was indifferent — but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness ,  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover ,  she could not prevent its frequently occurring .
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend ,  assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much ,  she feared ,  for the strength of his attachment .
as for jane ,  her anxiety under this suspense was ,  of course ,  more painful than elizabeths ,  but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ,  and between herself and elizabeth ,  therefore ,  the subject was never alluded to .
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother ,  an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley ,  express her impatience for his arrival ,  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .
it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight ,  but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .
he was too happy ,  however ,  to need much attention ;  and luckily for the others ,  the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company .
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge ,  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .
mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour ,  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .
as her successor in that house ,  she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
whenever charlotte came to see them ,  she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ;  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins ,  was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate ,  and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house ,  as soon as mr. bennet were dead .
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
indeed ,  mr. bennet ,  said she ,  it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house ,  that i should be forced to make way for her ,  and live to see her take her place in it my dear ,  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .
let us hope for better things .
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet ,  and therefore ,  instead of making any answer ,  she went on as before .
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .
if it was not for the entail ,  i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful ,  mr. bennet ,  for anything about the entail .
how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters ,  i cannot understand ;  and all for the sake of mr. collins too !
why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine ,  said mr. bennet .
miss bingleys letter arrived ,  and put an end to doubt .
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter ,  and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .
hope was over ,  entirely over ;  and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter ,  she found little ,  except the professed affection of the writer ,  that could give her any comfort .
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it .
her many attractions were again dwelt on ,  and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy ,  and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr. darcys house ,  and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .
elizabeth ,  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this ,  heard it in silent indignation .
her heart was divided between concern for her sister ,  and resentment against all others .
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .
that he was really fond of jane ,  she doubted no more than she had ever done ;  and much as she had always been disposed to like him ,  she could not think without anger ,  hardly without contempt ,  on that easiness of temper ,  that want of proper resolution ,  which now made him the slave of his designing friends ,  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination .
had his own happiness ,  however ,  been the only sacrifice ,  he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best ,  but her sisters was involved in it ,  as she thought he must be sensible himself .
it was a subject ,  in short ,  on which reflection would be long indulged ,  and must be unavailing .
she could think of nothing else ;  and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away ,  or were suppressed by his friends interference ;  whether he had been aware of janes attachment ,  or whether it had escaped his observation ;  whatever were the case ,  though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference ,  her sisters situation remained the same ,  her peace equally wounded .
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ;  but at last ,  on mrs. bennets leaving them together ,  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master ,  she could not help saying :  oh ,  that my dear mother had more command over herself !
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .
but i will not repine .
it cannot last long .
he will be forgot ,  and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude ,  but said nothing .
you doubt me ,  cried jane ,  slightly colouring ;  indeed ,  you have no reason .
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance ,  but that is all .
i have nothing either to hope or fear ,  and nothing to reproach him with .
thank god !
i have not that pain .
a little time ,  therefore — i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added ,  i have this comfort immediately ,  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side ,  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth ,  you are too good .
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ;  i do not know what to say to you .
i feel as if i had never done you justice ,  or loved you as you deserve miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit ,  and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection .
nay ,  said elizabeth ,  this is not fair .
you wish to think all the world respectable ,  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody .
i only want to think you perfect ,  and you set yourself against it .
do not be afraid of my running into any excess ,  of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill .
you need not .
there are few people whom i really love ,  and still fewer of whom i think well .
the more i see of the world ,  the more am i dissatisfied with it ;  and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters ,  and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense .
i have met with two instances lately ,  one i will not mention ;  the other is charlottes marriage .
it is unaccountable !
in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy ,  do not give way to such feelings as these .
they will ruin your happiness .
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .
consider mr. collinss respectability ,  and charlottes steady ,  prudent character .
remember that she is one of a large family ;  that as to fortune ,  it is a most eligible match ;  and be ready to believe ,  for everybodys sake ,  that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you ,  i would try to believe almost anything ,  but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ;  for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him ,  i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart .
my dear jane ,  mr. collins is a conceited ,  pompous ,  narrowminded ,  silly man ;  you know he is ,  as well as i do ;  and you must feel ,  as well as i do ,  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking .
you shall not defend her ,  though it is charlotte lucas .
you shall not ,  for the sake of one individual ,  change the meaning of principle and integrity ,  nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me ,  that selfishness is prudence ,  and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both ,  replied jane ;  and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together .
but enough of this .
you alluded to something else .
you mentioned two instances .
i cannot misunderstand you ,  but i entreat you ,  dear lizzy ,  not to pain me by thinking that person to blame ,  and saying your opinion of him is sunk .
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .
women fancy admiration means more than it does and men take care that they should if it is designedly done ,  they cannot be justified ;  but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingleys conduct to design ,  said elizabeth ;  but without scheming to do wrong ,  or to make others unhappy ,  there may be error ,  and there may be misery .
thoughtlessness ,  want of attention to other peoples feelings ,  and want of resolution ,  will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes ;  to the last .
but if i go on ,  i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .
stop me whilst you can you persist ,  then ,  in supposing his sisters influence him yes ,  in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it .
why should they try to influence him ?
they can only wish his happiness ;  and if he is attached to me ,  no other woman can secure it your first position is false .
they may wish many things besides his happiness ;  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ;  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money ,  great connections ,  and pride beyond a doubt ,  they do wish him to choose miss darcy ,  replied jane ;  but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .
they have known her much longer than they have known me ;  no wonder if they love her better .
but ,  whatever may be their own wishes ,  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers .
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it ,  unless there were something very objectionable ?
if they believed him attached to me ,  they would not try to part us ;  if he were so ,  they could not succeed .
by supposing such an affection ,  you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong ,  and me most unhappy .
do not distress me by the idea .
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken — or ,  at least ,  it is light ,  it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .
let me take it in the best light ,  in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ;  and from this time mr. bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more ,  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly ,  there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself ,  that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking ,  which ceased when he saw her no more ;  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time ,  she had the same story to repeat every day .
mrs. bennets best comfort was that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer .
mr. bennet treated the matter differently .
so ,  lizzy ,  said he one day ,  your sister is crossed in love ,  i find .
i congratulate her .
next to being married ,  a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then .
it is something to think of ,  and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .
when is your turn to come ?
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .
now is your time .
here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .
let wickham be your man .
he is a pleasant fellow ,  and would jilt you creditably thank you ,  sir ,  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
we must not all expect janes good fortune true ,  said mr. bennet ,  but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you ,  you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it mr. wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .
they saw him often ,  and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard ,  his claims on mr. darcy ,  and all that he had suffered from him ,  was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ;  and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known anything of the matter .
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case ,  unknown to the society of hertfordshire ;  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances ,  and urged the possibility of mistakes — but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity ,  mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .
the pain of separation ,  however ,  might be alleviated on his side ,  by preparations for the reception of his bride ;  as he had reason to hope ,  that shortly after his return into hertfordshire ,  the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ;  wished his fair cousins health and happiness again ,  and promised their father another letter of thanks .
on the following monday ,  mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife ,  who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .
mr. gardiner was a sensible ,  gentlemanlike man ,  greatly superior to his sister ,  as well by nature as education .
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade ,  and within view of his own warehouses ,  could have been so wellbred and agreeable .
mrs. gardiner ,  who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. phillips ,  was an amiable ,  intelligent ,  elegant woman ,  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .
between the two eldest and herself especially ,  there subsisted a particular regard .
they had frequently been staying with her in town .
the first part of mrs. gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .
when this was done she had a less active part to play .
it became her turn to listen .
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate ,  and much to complain of .
they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister .
two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage ,  and after all there was nothing in it .
i do not blame jane ,  she continued ,  for jane would have got mr. bingley if she could .
but lizzy !
oh ,  sister !
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collinss wife by this time ,  had it not been for her own perverseness .
he made her an offer in this very room ,  and she refused him .
the consequence of it is ,  that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have ,  and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .
the lucases are very artful people indeed ,  sister .
they are all for what they can get .
i am sorry to say it of them ,  but so it is .
it makes me very nervous and poorly ,  to be thwarted so in my own family ,  and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .
however ,  your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts ,  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us ,  of long sleeves mrs. gardiner ,  to whom the chief of this news had been given before ,  in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her ,  made her sister a slight answer ,  and ,  in compassion to her nieces ,  turned the conversation .
when alone with elizabeth afterwards ,  she spoke more on the subject .
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane ,  said she .
i am sorry it went off .
but these things happen so often !
a young man ,  such as you describe mr. bingley ,  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks ,  and when accident separates them ,  so easily forgets her ,  that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way ,  said elizabeth ,  but it will not do for us .
we do not suffer by accident .
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed ,  so doubtful ,  so indefinite ,  that it gives me very little idea .
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance ,  as to a real ,  strong attachment .
pray ,  how violent was mr. bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination ;  he was growing quite inattentive to other people ,  and wholly engrossed by her .
every time they met ,  it was more decided and remarkable .
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies ,  by not asking them to dance ;  and i spoke to him twice myself ,  without receiving an answer .
could there be finer symptoms ?
is not general incivility the very essence of love oh ,  yes — of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .
poor jane !
i am sorry for her ,  because ,  with her disposition ,  she may not get over it immediately .
it had better have happened to you ,  lizzy ;  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ?
change of scene might be of service — and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal ,  and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence .
i hope ,  added mrs. gardiner ,  that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .
we live in so different a part of town ,  all our connections are so different ,  and ,  as you well know ,  we go out so little ,  that it is very improbable that they should meet at all ,  unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible ;  for he is now in the custody of his friend ,  and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !
my dear aunt ,  how could you think of it ?
mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street ,  but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities ,  were he once to enter it ;  and depend upon it ,  mr. bingley never stirs without him so much the better .
i hope they will not meet at all .
but does not jane correspond with his sister ?
she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point ,  as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane ,  she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her ,  on examination ,  that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .
it was possible ,  and sometimes she thought it probable ,  that his affection might be reanimated ,  and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions .
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure ;  and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time ,  than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother ,  she might occasionally spend a morning with her ,  without any danger of seeing him .
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn ;  and what with the phillipses ,  the lucases ,  and the officers ,  there was not a day without its engagement .
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister ,  that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .
when the engagement was for home ,  some of the officers always made part of it — of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ;  and on these occasions ,  mrs. gardiner ,  rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation ,  narrowly observed them both .
without supposing them ,  from what she saw ,  to be very seriously in love ,  their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ;  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire ,  and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .
to mrs. gardiner ,  wickham had one means of affording pleasure ,  unconnected with his general powers .
about ten or a dozen years ago ,  before her marriage ,  she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged .
they had ,  therefore ,  many acquaintances in common ;  and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father ,  it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring .
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley ,  and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well .
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give ,  and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor ,  she was delighting both him and herself .
on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcys treatment of him ,  she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it ,  and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ,  illnatured boy .
mrs. gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ;  after honestly telling her what she thought ,  she thus went on :  you are too sensible a girl ,  lizzy ,  to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ;  and ,  therefore ,  i am not afraid of speaking openly .
seriously ,  i would have you be on your guard .
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .
i have nothing to say against him ;  he is a most interesting young man ;  and if he had the fortune he ought to have ,  i should think you could not do better .
but as it is ,  you must not let your fancy run away with you .
you have sense ,  and we all expect you to use it .
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct ,  i am sure .
you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt ,  this is being serious indeed yes ,  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well ,  then ,  you need not be under any alarm .
i will take care of myself ,  and of mr. wickham too .
he shall not be in love with me ,  if i can prevent it elizabeth ,  you are not serious now i beg your pardon ,  i will try again .
at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ;  no ,  i certainly am not .
but he is ,  beyond all comparison ,  the most agreeable man i ever saw — and if he becomes really attached to me — i believe it will be better that he should not .
i see the imprudence of it .
oh !
that abominable mr. darcy !
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour ,  and i should be miserable to forfeit it .
my father ,  however ,  is partial to mr. wickham .
in short ,  my dear aunt ,  i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ;  but since we see every day that where there is affection ,  young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other ,  how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted ,  or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?
all that i can promise you ,  therefore ,  is not to be in a hurry .
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .
when i am in company with him ,  i will not be wishing .
in short ,  i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often .
at least ,  you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day ,  said elizabeth with a conscious smile :  very true ,  it will be wise in me to refrain from that .
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .
you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .
but really ,  and upon my honour ,  i will try to do what i think to be the wisest ;  and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was ,  and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints ,  they parted ;  a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point ,  without being resented .
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ;  but as he took up his abode with the lucases ,  his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet .
his marriage was now fast approaching ,  and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable ,  and even repeatedly to say ,  in an illnatured tone ,  that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day ,  and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ;  and when she rose to take leave ,  elizabeth ,  ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes ,  and sincerely affected herself ,  accompanied her out of the room .
as they went downstairs together ,  charlotte said :  i shall depend on hearing from you very often ,  eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask you .
will you come and see me we shall often meet ,  i hope ,  in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time .
promise me ,  therefore ,  to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse ,  though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .
my father and maria are coming to me in march ,  added charlotte ,  and i hope you will consent to be of the party .
indeed ,  eliza ,  you will be as welcome as either of them the wedding took place ;  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door ,  and everybody had as much to say ,  or to hear ,  on the subject as usual .
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ;  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ;  that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over ,  and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent ,  it was for the sake of what had been ,  rather than what was .
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ;  there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home ,  how she would like lady catherine ,  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ;  though ,  when the letters were read ,  elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .
she wrote cheerfully ,  seemed surrounded with comforts ,  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .
the house ,  furniture ,  neighbourhood ,  and roads ,  were all to her taste ,  and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging .
it was mr. collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ;  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest .
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ;  and when she wrote again ,  elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .
jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline .
she accounted for it ,  however ,  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost .
my aunt ,  she continued ,  is going tomorrow into that part of the town ,  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid ,  and she had seen miss bingley .
i did not think caroline in spirits ,  were her words ,  but she was very glad to see me ,  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .
i was right ,  therefore ,  my last letter had never reached her .
i inquired after their brother ,  of course .
he was well ,  but so much engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him .
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .
i wish i could see her .
my visit was not long ,  as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out .
i dare say i shall see them soon here elizabeth shook her head over this letter .
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sisters being in town .
four weeks passed away ,  and jane saw nothing of him .
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ;  but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention .
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight ,  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her ,  the visitor did at last appear ;  but the shortness of her stay ,  and yet more ,  the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt .
my dearest lizzy will ,  i am sure ,  be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement ,  at my expense ,  when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me .
but ,  my dear sister ,  though the event has proved you right ,  do not think me obstinate if i still assert that ,  considering what her behaviour was ,  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ;  but if the same circumstances were to happen again ,  i am sure i should be deceived again .
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ;  and not a note ,  not a line ,  did i receive in the meantime .
when she did come ,  it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ;  she made a slight ,  formal apology ,  for not calling before ,  said not a word of wishing to see me again ,  and was in every respect so altered a creature ,  that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .
i pity ,  though i cannot help blaming her .
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ;  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side .
but i pity her ,  because she must feel that she has been acting wrong ,  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
i need not explain myself farther ;  and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless ,  yet if she feels it ,  it will easily account for her behaviour to me ;  and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister ,  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable .
i cannot but wonder ,  however ,  at her having any such fears now ,  because ,  if he had at all cared about me ,  we must have met ,  long ago .
he knows of my being in town ,  i am certain ,  from something she said herself ;  and yet it would seem ,  by her manner of talking ,  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .
i cannot understand it .
if i were not afraid of judging harshly ,  i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought ,  and think only of what will make me happy — your affection ,  and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .
let me hear from you very soon .
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again ,  of giving up the house ,  but not with any certainty .
we had better not mention it .
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .
pray go to see them ,  with sir william and maria .
i am sure you will be very comfortable there — yours ,  etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain ;  but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped ,  by the sister at least .
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .
she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions .
his character sunk on every review of it ;  and as a punishment for him ,  as well as a possible advantage to jane ,  she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcys sister ,  as by wickhams account ,  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman ,  and required information ;  and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .
his apparent partiality had subsided ,  his attentions were over ,  he was the admirer of some one else .
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all ,  but she could see it and write of it without material pain .
her heart had been but slightly touched ,  and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice ,  had fortune permitted it .
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ;  but elizabeth ,  less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes ,  did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .
nothing ,  on the contrary ,  could be more natural ;  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her ,  she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both ,  and could very sincerely wish him happy .
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner ;  and after relating the circumstances ,  she thus went on :  i am now convinced ,  my dear aunt ,  that i have never been much in love ;  for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion ,  i should at present detest his very name ,  and wish him all manner of evil .
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him ;  they are even impartial towards miss king .
i cannot find out that i hate her at all ,  or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .
there can be no love in all this .
my watchfulness has been effectual ;  and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him ,  i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .
they are young in the ways of the world ,  and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain with no greater events than these in the longbourn family ,  and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton ,  sometimes dirty and sometimes cold ,  did january and february pass away .
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ;  but charlotte ,  she soon found ,  was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again ,  and weakened her disgust of mr. collins .
there was novelty in the scheme ,  and as ,  with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters ,  home could not be faultless ,  a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ;  and ,  in short ,  as the time drew near ,  she would have been very sorry for any delay .
everything ,  however ,  went on smoothly ,  and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch .
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time ,  and the plan became perfect as plan could be .
the only pain was in leaving her father ,  who would certainly miss her ,  and who ,  when it came to the point ,  so little liked her going ,  that he told her to write to him ,  and almost promised to answer her letter .
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly ;  on his side even more .
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention ,  the first to listen and to pity ,  the first to be admired ;  and in his manner of bidding her adieu ,  wishing her every enjoyment ,  reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh ,  and trusting their opinion of her — their opinion of everybody — would always coincide ,  there was a solicitude ,  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ;  and she parted from him convinced that ,  whether married or single ,  he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
sir william lucas ,  and his daughter maria ,  a goodhumoured girl ,  but as emptyheaded as himself ,  had nothing to say that could be worth hearing ,  and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .
elizabeth loved absurdities ,  but she had known sir williams too long .
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ;  and his civilities were worn out ,  like his information .
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles ,  and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon .
as they drove to mr. gardiners door ,  jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival ;  when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them ,  and elizabeth ,  looking earnestly in her face ,  was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls ,  whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom ,  and whose shyness ,  as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth ,  prevented their coming lower .
all was joy and kindness .
the day passed most pleasantly away ;  the morning in bustle and shopping ,  and the evening at one of the theatres .
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .
their first object was her sister ;  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear ,  in reply to her minute inquiries ,  that though jane always struggled to support her spirits ,  there were periods of dejection .
it was reasonable ,  however ,  to hope that they would not continue long .
mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street ,  and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself ,  which proved that the former had ,  from her heart ,  given up the acquaintance .
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion ,  and complimented her on bearing it so well .
but my dear elizabeth ,  she added ,  what sort of girl is miss king ?
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray ,  my dear aunt ,  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs ,  between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
where does discretion end ,  and avarice begin ?
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me ,  because it would be imprudent ;  and now ,  because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds ,  you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is ,  i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl ,  i believe .
i know no harm of her but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune no — why should he ?
if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money ,  what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about ,  and who was equally poor but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .
if she does not object to it ,  why should we her not objecting does not justify him .
it only shows her being deficient in something herself — sense or feeling well ,  cried elizabeth ,  have it as you choose .
he shall be mercenary ,  and she shall be foolish no ,  lizzy ,  that is what i do not choose .
i should be sorry ,  you know ,  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh !
if that is all ,  i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ;  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .
i am sick of them all .
thank heaven !
i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality ,  who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing ,  after all take care ,  lizzy ;  that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play ,  she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .
we have not determined how far it shall carry us ,  said mrs. gardiner ,  but ,  perhaps ,  to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth ,  and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .
oh ,  my dear ,  dear aunt ,  she rapturously cried ,  what delight !
what felicity !
you give me fresh life and vigour .
adieu to disappointment and spleen .
what are young men to rocks and mountains ?
oh !
what hours of transport we shall spend !
and when we do return ,  it shall not be like other travellers ,  without being able to give one accurate idea of anything .
we will know where we have gone — we will recollect what we have seen .
lakes ,  mountains ,  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ;  nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene ,  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation .
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ;  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment ;  for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health ,  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford ,  every eye was in search of the parsonage ,  and every turning expected to bring it in view .
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side .
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .
at length the parsonage was discernible .
the garden sloping to the road ,  the house standing in it ,  the green pales ,  and the laurel hedge ,  everything declared they were arriving .
mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door ,  and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house ,  amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .
in a moment they were all out of the chaise ,  rejoicing at the sight of each other .
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure ,  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received .
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage ;  his formal civility was just what it had been ,  and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family .
they were then ,  with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance ,  taken into the house ;  and as soon as they were in the parlour ,  he welcomed them a second time ,  with ostentatious formality to his humble abode ,  and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment .
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ;  and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room ,  its aspect and its furniture ,  he addressed himself particularly to her ,  as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .
but though everything seemed neat and comfortable ,  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ,  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion .
when mr. collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed ,  which certainly was not unseldom ,  she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ;  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room ,  from the sideboard to the fender ,  to give an account of their journey ,  and of all that had happened in london ,  mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden ,  which was large and well laid out ,  and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .
to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ;  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise ,  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .
here ,  leading the way through every walk and cross walk ,  and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for ,  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .
he could number the fields in every direction ,  and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .
but of all the views which his garden ,  or which the country or kingdom could boast ,  none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings ,  afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .
it was a handsome modern building ,  well situated on rising ground .
from his garden ,  mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows ;  but the ladies ,  not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost ,  turned back ;  and while sir william accompanied him ,  charlotte took her sister and friend over the house ,  extremely well pleased ,  probably ,  to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help .
it was rather small ,  but well built and convenient ;  and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .
when mr. collins could be forgotten ,  there was really an air of great comfort throughout ,  and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it ,  elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner ,  when mr. collins joining in ,  observed :  yes ,  miss elizabeth ,  you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church ,  and i need not say you will be delighted with her .
she is all affability and condescension ,  and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .
we dine at rosings twice every week ,  and are never allowed to walk home .
her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us .
i should say ,  one of her ladyships carriages ,  for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable ,  sensible woman indeed ,  added charlotte ,  and a most attentive neighbour very true ,  my dear ,  that is exactly what i say .
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news ,  and telling again what had already been written ;  and when it closed ,  elizabeth ,  in the solitude of her chamber ,  had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment ,  to understand her address in guiding ,  and composure in bearing with ,  her husband ,  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass ,  the quiet tenor of their usual employments ,  the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins ,  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .
a lively imagination soon settled it all .
about the middle of the next day ,  as she was in her room getting ready for a walk ,  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ;  and ,  after listening a moment ,  she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry ,  and calling loudly after her .
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place ,  who ,  breathless with agitation ,  cried out —  oh ,  my dear eliza !
pray make haste and come into the diningroom ,  for there is such a sight to be seen !
i will not tell you what it is .
make haste ,  and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain ;  maria would tell her nothing more ,  and down they ran into the diningroom ,  which fronted the lane ,  in quest of this wonder ;  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .
and is this all cried elizabeth .
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden ,  and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la !
my dear ,  said maria ,  quite shocked at the mistake ,  it is not lady catherine .
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson ,  who lives with them ;  the other is miss de bourgh .
only look at her .
she is quite a little creature .
who would have thought that she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .
why does she not come in oh ,  charlotte says she hardly ever does .
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance ,  said elizabeth ,  struck with other ideas .
she looks sickly and cross .
yes ,  she will do for him very well .
she will make him a very proper wife mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ;  and sir william ,  to elizabeths high diversion ,  was stationed in the doorway ,  in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him ,  and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .
at length there was nothing more to be said ;  the ladies drove on ,  and the others returned into the house .
mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune ,  which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .
mr. collinss triumph ,  in consequence of this invitation ,  was complete .
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors ,  and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife ,  was exactly what he had wished for ;  and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon ,  was such an instance of lady catherines condescension ,  as he knew not how to admire enough .
i confess ,  said he ,  that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .
i rather expected ,  from my knowledge of her affability ,  that it would happen .
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation ,  moreover ,  including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened ,  replied sir william ,  from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are ,  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .
about the court ,  such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings .
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect ,  that the sight of such rooms ,  so many servants ,  and so splendid a dinner ,  might not wholly overpower them .
when the ladies were separating for the toilette ,  he said to elizabeth —  do not make yourself uneasy ,  my dear cousin ,  about your apparel .
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter .
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest — there is no occasion for anything more .
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing ,  he came two or three times to their different doors ,  to recommend their being quick ,  as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .
such formidable accounts of her ladyship ,  and her manner of living ,  quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company ,  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st .
jamess .
as the weather was fine ,  they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .
every park has its beauty and its prospects ;  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with ,  though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire ,  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house ,  and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .
when they ascended the steps to the hall ,  marias alarm was every moment increasing ,  and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .
elizabeths courage did not fail her .
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue ,  and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation .
from the entrancehall ,  of which mr. collins pointed out ,  with a rapturous air ,  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments ,  they followed the servants through an antechamber ,  to the room where lady catherine ,  her daughter ,  and mrs. jenkinson were sitting .
her ladyship ,  with great condescension ,  arose to receive them ;  and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers ,  it was performed in a proper manner ,  without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .
in spite of having been at st .
jamess ,  sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him ,  that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow ,  and take his seat without saying a word ;  and his daughter ,  frightened almost out of her senses ,  sat on the edge of her chair ,  not knowing which way to look .
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene ,  and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .
lady catherine was a tall ,  large woman ,  with stronglymarked features ,  which might once have been handsome .
her air was not conciliating ,  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .
she was not rendered formidable by silence ;  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone ,  as marked her selfimportance ,  and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeths mind ;  and from the observation of the day altogether ,  she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented .
when ,  after examining the mother ,  in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy ,  she turned her eyes on the daughter ,  she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small .
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies .
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ;  her features ,  though not plain ,  were insignificant ;  and she spoke very little ,  except in a low voice ,  to mrs. jenkinson ,  in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable ,  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said ,  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .
after sitting a few minutes ,  they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view ,  mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties ,  and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .
the dinner was exceedingly handsome ,  and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ;  and ,  as he had likewise foretold ,  he took his seat at the bottom of the table ,  by her ladyships desire ,  and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .
he carved ,  and ate ,  and praised with delighted alacrity ;  and every dish was commended ,  first by him and then by sir william ,  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said ,  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration ,  and gave most gracious smiles ,  especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .
the party did not supply much conversation .
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening ,  but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh — the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine ,  and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime .
mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate ,  pressing her to try some other dish ,  and fearing she was indisposed .
maria thought speaking out of the question ,  and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom ,  there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk ,  which she did without any intermission till coffee came in ,  delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner ,  as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted .
she inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely ,  gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ;  told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers ,  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention ,  which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins ,  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth ,  but especially to the latter ,  of whose connections she knew the least ,  and who she observed to mrs. collins was a very genteel ,  pretty kind of girl .
she asked her ,  at different times ,  how many sisters she had ,  whether they were older or younger than herself ,  whether any of them were likely to be married ,  whether they were handsome ,  where they had been educated ,  what carriage her father kept ,  and what had been her mothers maiden name ?
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly .
lady catherine then observed ,  your fathers estate is entailed on mr. collins ,  i think .
for your sake ,  turning to charlotte ,  i am glad of it ;  but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family .
do you play and sing ,  miss bennet a little oh !
then — some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .
our instrument is a capital one ,  probably superior to —  — you shall try it some day .
do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn ?
you ought all to have learned .
the miss webbs all play ,  and their father has not so good an income as yours .
do you draw no ,  not at all what ,  none of you not one that is very strange .
but i suppose you had no opportunity .
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have had no objection ,  but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess !
how was that possible ?
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !
i never heard of such a thing .
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case .
then ,  who taught you ?
who attended to you ?
without a governess ,  you must have been neglected compared with some families ,  i believe we were ;  but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means .
we were always encouraged to read ,  and had all the masters that were necessary .
those who chose to be idle ,  certainly might aye ,  no doubt ;  but that is what a governess will prevent ,  and if i had known your mother ,  i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction ,  and nobody but a governess can give it .
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .
four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ;  and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person ,  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me ,  and the family are quite delighted with her .
mrs. collins ,  did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me ?
she finds miss pope a treasure .
lady catherine ,  said she ,  you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out ,  miss bennet yes ,  maam ,  all all !
what ,  all five out at once ?
very odd !
and you only the second .
the younger ones out before the elder ones are married !
your younger sisters must be very young yes ,  my youngest is not sixteen .
perhaps she is full young to be much in company .
but really ,  maam ,  i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters ,  that they should not have their share of society and amusement ,  because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .
the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first .
and to be kept back on such a motive !
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word ,  said her ladyship ,  you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .
pray ,  what is your age with three younger sisters grown up ,  replied elizabeth ,  smiling ,  your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ;  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .
you cannot be more than twenty ,  i am sure ,  therefore you need not conceal your age i am not oneandtwenty when the gentlemen had joined them ,  and tea was over ,  the cardtables were placed .
lady catherine ,  sir william ,  and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille ;  and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino ,  the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party .
their table was superlatively stupid .
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game ,  except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold ,  or having too much or too little light .
a great deal more passed at the other table .
lady catherine was generally speaking — stating the mistakes of the three others ,  or relating some anecdote of herself .
mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said ,  thanking her for every fish he won ,  and apologising if he thought he won too many .
sir william did not say much .
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose ,  the tables were broken up ,  the carriage was offered to mrs. collins ,  gratefully accepted and immediately ordered .
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach ;  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed .
as soon as they had driven from the door ,  elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings ,  which ,  for charlottes sake ,  she made more favourable than it really was .
but her commendation ,  though costing her some trouble ,  could by no means satisfy mr. collins ,  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands .
sir william stayed only a week at hunsford ,  but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled ,  and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .
while sir william was with them ,  mr. collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig ,  and showing him the country ;  but when he went away ,  the whole family returned to their usual employments ,  and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ,  for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing ,  and looking out of the window in his own bookroom ,  which fronted the road .
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use ;  it was a better sized room ,  and had a more pleasant aspect ;  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did ,  for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment ,  had they sat in one equally lively ;  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane ,  and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along ,  and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton ,  which he never failed coming to inform them of ,  though it happened almost every day .
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage ,  and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte ,  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out .
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings ,  and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ;  and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of ,  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship ,  and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
she examined into their employments ,  looked at their work ,  and advised them to do it differently ;  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture ;  or detected the housemaid in negligence ;  and if she accepted any refreshment ,  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collinss joints of meat were too large for her family .
elizabeth soon perceived ,  that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county ,  she was a most active magistrate in her own parish ,  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ;  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome ,  discontented ,  or too poor ,  she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences ,  silence their complaints ,  and scold them into harmony and plenty .
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ;  and ,  allowing for the loss of sir william ,  and there being only one cardtable in the evening ,  every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .
their other engagements were few ,  as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collinss reach .
this ,  however ,  was no evil to elizabeth ,  and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ;  there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte ,  and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .
her favourite walk ,  and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine ,  was along the open grove which edged that side of the park ,  where there was a nice sheltered path ,  which no one seemed to value but herself ,  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity .
in this quiet way ,  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .
easter was approaching ,  and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings ,  which in so small a circle must be important .
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks ,  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer ,  his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties ,  and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were ,  by his behaviour to his cousin ,  for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ,  who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction ,  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration ,  and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage ;  for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane ,  in order to have the earliest assurance of it ,  and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park ,  hurried home with the great intelligence .
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them ,  for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam ,  the younger son of his uncle lord  —  —  ,  and ,  to the great surprise of all the party ,  when mr. collins returned ,  the gentlemen accompanied him .
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room ,  crossing the road ,  and immediately running into the other ,  told the girls what an honour they might expect ,  adding :  i may thank you ,  eliza ,  for this piece of civility .
mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment ,  before their approach was announced by the doorbell ,  and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .
colonel fitzwilliam ,  who led the way ,  was about thirty ,  not handsome ,  but in person and address most truly the gentleman .
mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire — paid his compliments ,  with his usual reserve ,  to mrs. collins ,  and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend ,  met her with every appearance of composure .
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word .
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man ,  and talked very pleasantly ;  but his cousin ,  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins ,  sat for some time without speaking to anybody .
at length ,  however ,  his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .
she answered him in the usual way ,  and after a moments pause ,  added :  my eldest sister has been in town these three months .
have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had ;  but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ,  and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .
the subject was pursued no farther ,  and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage ,  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings .
it was some days ,  however ,  before they received any invitation thither — for while there were visitors in the house ,  they could not be necessary ;  and it was not till easterday ,  almost a week after the gentlemens arrival ,  that they were honoured by such an attention ,  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .
for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter .
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time ,  but mr. darcy they had seen only at church .
the invitation was accepted of course ,  and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom .
her ladyship received them civilly ,  but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ;  and she was ,  in fact ,  almost engrossed by her nephews ,  speaking to them ,  especially to darcy ,  much more than to any other person in the room .
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ;  anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings ;  and mrs. collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .
he now seated himself by her ,  and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire ,  of travelling and staying at home ,  of new books and music ,  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ;  and they conversed with so much spirit and flow ,  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself ,  as well as of mr. darcy .
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ;  and that her ladyship ,  after a while ,  shared the feeling ,  was more openly acknowledged ,  for she did not scruple to call out :  what is that you are saying ,  fitzwilliam ?
what is it you are talking of ?
what are you telling miss bennet ?
let me hear what it is we are speaking of music ,  madam ,  said he ,  when no longer able to avoid a reply .
of music !
then pray speak aloud .
it is of all subjects my delight .
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music .
there are few people in england ,  i suppose ,  who have more true enjoyment of music than myself ,  or a better natural taste .
if i had ever learnt ,  i should have been a great proficient .
and so would anne ,  if her health had allowed her to apply .
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .
how does georgiana get on ,  darcy mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency .
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her ,  said lady catherine ;  and pray tell her from me ,  that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal i assure you ,  madam ,  he replied ,  that she does not need such advice .
she practises very constantly so much the better .
it cannot be done too much ;  and when i next write to her ,  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice .
i have told miss bennet several times ,  that she will never play really well unless she practises more ;  and though mrs. collins has no instrument ,  she is very welcome ,  as i have often told her ,  to come to rosings every day ,  and play on the pianoforte in mrs. jenkinsons room .
she would be in nobodys way ,  you know ,  in that part of the house mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding ,  and made no answer .
when coffee was over ,  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ;  and she sat down directly to the instrument .
he drew a chair near her .
lady catherine listened to half a song ,  and then talked ,  as before ,  to her other nephew ;  till the latter walked away from her ,  and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance .
elizabeth saw what he was doing ,  and at the first convenient pause ,  turned to him with an arch smile ,  and said :  you mean to frighten me ,  mr. darcy ,  by coming in all this state to hear me ?
i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .
my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say you are mistaken ,  he replied ,  because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ;  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself ,  and said to colonel fitzwilliam ,  your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me ,  and teach you not to believe a word i say .
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character ,  in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .
indeed ,  mr. darcy ,  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire — and ,  give me leave to say ,  very impolitic too — for it is provoking me to retaliate ,  and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you ,  said he ,  smilingly .
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of ,  cried colonel fitzwilliam .
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear then — but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire ,  you must know ,  was at a ball — and at this ball ,  what do you think he did ?
he danced only four dances ,  though gentlemen were scarce ;  and ,  to my certain knowledge ,  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .
mr. darcy ,  you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true ;  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom .
well ,  colonel fitzwilliam ,  what do i play next ?
my fingers wait your orders perhaps ,  said darcy ,  i should have judged better ,  had i sought an introduction ;  but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth ,  still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education ,  and who has lived in the world ,  is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question ,  said fitzwilliam ,  without applying to him .
it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess ,  said darcy ,  of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .
i cannot catch their tone of conversation ,  or appear interested in their concerns ,  as i often see done my fingers ,  said elizabeth ,  do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do .
they have not the same force or rapidity ,  and do not produce the same expression .
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault — because i will not take the trouble of practising .
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said ,  you are perfectly right .
you have employed your time much better .
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting .
we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine ,  who called out to know what they were talking of .
elizabeth immediately began playing again .
lady catherine approached ,  and ,  after listening for a few minutes ,  said to darcy :  miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more ,  and could have the advantage of a london master .
she has a very good notion of fingering ,  though her taste is not equal to annes .
anne would have been a delightful performer ,  had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise ;  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ;  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley ,  that he might have been just as likely to marry her ,  had she been his relation .
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance ,  mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ,  and ,  at the request of the gentlemen ,  remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home .
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning ,  and writing to jane while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village ,  when she was startled by a ring at the door ,  the certain signal of a visitor .
as she had heard no carriage ,  she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine ,  and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions ,  when the door opened ,  and ,  to her very great surprise ,  mr. darcy ,  and mr. darcy only ,  entered the room .
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone ,  and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within .
they then sat down ,  and when her inquiries after rosings were made ,  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
it was absolutely necessary ,  therefore ,  to think of something ,  and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire ,  and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure ,  she observed :  how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november ,  mr. darcy !
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ;  for ,  if i recollect right ,  he went but the day before .
he and his sisters were well ,  i hope ,  when you left london perfectly so ,  i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer ,  and ,  after a short pause added :  i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so ;  but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future .
he has many friends ,  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at netherfield ,  it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely ,  for then we might possibly get a settled family there .
but ,  perhaps ,  mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own ,  and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised ,  said darcy ,  if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer .
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ;  and ,  having nothing else to say ,  was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
he took the hint ,  and soon began with ,  this seems a very comfortable house .
lady catherine ,  i believe ,  did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford i believe she did — and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr .
collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes ,  indeed ,  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him ,  or have made him happy if they had .
my friend has an excellent understanding — though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .
she seems perfectly happy ,  however ,  and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance ,  do you call it ?
it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road ?
little more than half a days journey .
yes ,  i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match ,  cried elizabeth .
i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn ,  i suppose ,  would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood ;  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield ,  and she blushed as she answered :  i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .
the far and the near must be relative ,  and depend on many varying circumstances .
where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant ,  distance becomes no evil .
but that is not the case here .
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income ,  but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys — and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her ,  and said ,  you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .
you cannot have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised .
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ;  he drew back his chair ,  took a newspaper from the table ,  and glancing over it ,  said ,  in a colder voice :  are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued ,  on either side calm and concise — and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister ,  just returned from her walk .
the ttette surprised them .
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet ,  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody ,  went away .
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte ,  as soon as he was gone .
my dear ,  eliza ,  he must be in love with you ,  or he would never have called us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence ,  it did not seem very likely ,  even to charlottes wishes ,  to be the case ;  and after various conjectures ,  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do ,  which was the more probable from the time of year .
all field sports were over .
within doors there was lady catherine ,  books ,  and a billiardtable ,  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors ;  and in the nearness of the parsonage ,  or the pleasantness of the walk to it ,  or of the people who lived in it ,  the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .
they called at various times of the morning ,  sometimes separately ,  sometimes together ,  and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society ,  a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ;  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him ,  as well as by his evident admiration of her ,  of her former favourite george wickham ;  and though ,  in comparing them ,  she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners ,  she believed he might have the best informed mind .
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage ,  it was more difficult to understand .
it could not be for society ,  as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ;  and when he did speak ,  it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice — a sacrifice to propriety ,  not a pleasure to himself .
he seldom appeared really animated .
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .
colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity ,  proved that he was generally different ,  which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ;  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love ,  and the object of that love her friend eliza ,  she set herself seriously to work to find it out .
she watched him whenever they were at rosings ,  and whenever he came to hunsford ;  but without much success .
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal ,  but the expression of that look was disputable .
it was an earnest ,  steadfast gaze ,  but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it ,  and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her ,  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ;  and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject ,  from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ;  for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt ,  that all her friends dislike would vanish ,  if she could suppose him to be in her power .
in her kind schemes for elizabeth ,  she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man ;  he certainly admired her ,  and his situation in life was most eligible ;  but ,  to counterbalance these advantages ,  mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church ,  and his cousin could have none at all .
more than once did elizabeth ,  in her ramble within the park ,  unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ,  and ,  to prevent its ever happening again ,  took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers .
how it could occur a second time ,  therefore ,  was very odd !
yet it did ,  and even a third .
it seemed like wilful illnature ,  or a voluntary penance ,  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away ,  but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .
he never said a great deal ,  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ;  but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions — about her pleasure in being at hunsford ,  her love of solitary walks ,  and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collinss happiness ;  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house ,  he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .
his words seemed to imply it .
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
she supposed ,  if he meant anything ,  he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .
it distressed her a little ,  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .
she was engaged one day as she walked ,  in perusing janes last letter ,  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits ,  when ,  instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy ,  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile ,  she said :  i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park ,  he replied ,  as i generally do every year ,  and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .
are you going much farther no ,  i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn ,  and they walked towards the parsonage together .
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she .
yes — if darcy does not put it off again .
but i am at his disposal .
he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement ,  he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice .
i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy he likes to have his own way very well ,  replied colonel fitzwilliam .
but so we all do .
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others ,  because he is rich ,  and many others are poor .
i speak feelingly .
a younger son ,  you know ,  must be inured to selfdenial and dependence in my opinion ,  the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
now seriously ,  what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence ?
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose ,  or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questions — and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .
but in matters of greater weight ,  i may suffer from want of money .
younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune ,  which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent ,  and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this ,  thought elizabeth ,  meant for me and she coloured at the idea ;  but ,  recovering herself ,  said in a lively tone ,  and pray ,  what is the usual price of an earls younger son ?
unless the elder brother is very sickly ,  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style ,  and the subject dropped .
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed ,  she soon afterwards said :  i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal .
i wonder he does not marry ,  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
but ,  perhaps ,  his sister does as well for the present ,  and ,  as she is under his sole care ,  he may do what he likes with her no ,  said colonel fitzwilliam ,  that is an advantage which he must divide with me .
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy are you indeed ?
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?
does your charge give you much trouble ?
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ,  and if she has the true darcy spirit ,  she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly ;  and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness ,  convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .
she directly replied :  you need not be frightened .
i never heard any harm of her ;  and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance ,  mrs. hurst and miss bingley .
i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a little .
their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man — he is a great friend of darcys oh !
yes ,  said elizabeth drily ;  mr .
darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley ,  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him !
yes ,  i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
from something that he told me in our journey hither ,  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
but i ought to beg his pardon ,  for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known ,  because if it were to get round to the ladys family ,  it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .
what he told me was merely this :  that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage ,  but without mentioning names or any other particulars ,  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort ,  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr. darcy give you reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts ,  said fitzwilliam ,  smiling .
he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer ,  and walked on ,  her heart swelling with indignation .
after watching her a little ,  fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
i am thinking of what you have been telling me ,  said she .
your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings .
why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination ,  or why ,  upon his own judgement alone ,  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy .
but ,  she continued ,  recollecting herself ,  as we know none of the particulars ,  it is not fair to condemn him .
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise ,  said fitzwilliam ,  but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly ;  but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy ,  that she would not trust herself with an answer ,  and therefore ,  abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage .
there ,  shut into her own room ,  as soon as their visitor left them ,  she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted ;  but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .
if his own vanity ,  however ,  did not mislead him ,  he was the cause ,  his pride and caprice were the cause ,  of all that jane had suffered ,  and still continued to suffer .
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate ,  generous heart in the world ;  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
there were some very strong objections against the lady ,  were colonel fitzwilliams words ;  and those strong objections probably were ,  her having one uncle who was a country attorney ,  and another who was in business in london .
to jane herself ,  she exclaimed ,  there could be no possibility of objection ;  all loveliness and goodness as she is — her understanding excellent ,  her mind improved ,  and her manners captivating .
neither could anything be urged against my father ,  who ,  though with some peculiarities ,  has abilities mr. darcy himself need not disdain ,  and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother ,  her confidence gave way a little ;  but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy ,  whose pride ,  she was convinced ,  would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections ,  than from their want of sense ;  and she was quite decided ,  at last ,  that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride ,  and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned ,  brought on a headache ;  and it grew so much worse towards the evening ,  that ,  added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy ,  it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings ,  where they were engaged to drink tea .
mrs. collins ,  seeing that she was really unwell ,  did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ;  but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home .
when they were gone ,  elizabeth ,  as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy ,  chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .
they contained no actual complaint ,  nor was there any revival of past occurrences ,  or any communication of present suffering .
but in all ,  and in almost every line of each ,  there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style ,  and which ,  proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone ,  had been scarcely ever clouded .
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness ,  with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .
mr. darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict ,  gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings .
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next — and ,  a still greater ,  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again ,  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits ,  by all that affection could do .
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ;  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all ,  and agreeable as he was ,  she did not mean to be unhappy about him .
while settling this point ,  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell ,  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself ,  who had once before called late in the evening ,  and might now come to inquire particularly after her .
but this idea was soon banished ,  and her spirits were very differently affected ,  when ,  to her utter amazement ,  she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .
in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health ,  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
she answered him with cold civility .
he sat down for a few moments ,  and then getting up ,  walked about the room .
elizabeth was surprised ,  but said not a word .
after a silence of several minutes ,  he came towards her in an agitated manner ,  and thus began :  in vain i have struggled .
it will not do .
my feelings will not be repressed .
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression .
she stared ,  coloured ,  doubted ,  and was silent .
this he considered sufficient encouragement ;  and the avowal of all that he felt ,  and had long felt for her ,  immediately followed .
he spoke well ;  but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed ;  and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .
his sense of her inferiority — of its being a degradation — of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination ,  were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding ,  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike ,  she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection ,  and though her intentions did not vary for an instant ,  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ;  till ,  roused to resentment by his subsequent language ,  she lost all compassion in anger .
she tried ,  however ,  to compose herself to answer him with patience ,  when he should have done .
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which ,  in spite of all his endeavours ,  he had found impossible to conquer ;  and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .
as he said this ,  she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety ,  but his countenance expressed real security .
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther ,  and ,  when he ceased ,  the colour rose into her cheeks ,  and she said :  in such cases as this ,  it is ,  i believe ,  the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed ,  however unequally they may be returned .
it is natural that obligation should be felt ,  and if i could feel gratitude ,  i would now thank you .
but i cannot — i have never desired your good opinion ,  and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone .
it has been most unconsciously done ,  however ,  and i hope will be of short duration .
the feelings which ,  you tell me ,  have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard ,  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr. darcy ,  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face ,  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .
his complexion became pale with anger ,  and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .
he was struggling for the appearance of composure ,  and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it .
the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful .
at length ,  with a voice of forced calmness ,  he said :  and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
i might ,  perhaps ,  wish to be informed why ,  with so little endeavour at civility ,  i am thus rejected .
but it is of small importance i might as well inquire ,  replied she ,  why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me ,  you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will ,  against your reason ,  and even against your character ?
was not this some excuse for incivility ,  if i was uncivil ?
but i have other provocations .
you know i have .
had not my feelings decided against you — had they been indifferent ,  or had they even been favourable ,  do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining ,  perhaps for ever ,  the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words ,  mr. darcy changed colour ;  but the emotion was short ,  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued :  i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .
you dare not ,  you cannot deny ,  that you have been the principal ,  if not the only means of dividing them from each other — of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability ,  and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes ,  and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused ,  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .
can you deny that you have done it she repeated .
with assumed tranquillity he then replied :  i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister ,  or that i rejoice in my success .
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection ,  but its meaning did not escape ,  nor was it likely to conciliate her .
but it is not merely this affair ,  she continued ,  on which my dislike is founded .
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided .
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .
on this subject ,  what can you have to say ?
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns ,  said darcy ,  in a less tranquil tone ,  and with a heightened colour .
who that knows what his misfortunes have been ,  can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously ;  yes ,  his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction ,  cried elizabeth with energy .
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty .
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him .
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
you have done all this !
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule and this ,  cried darcy ,  as he walked with quick steps across the room ,  is your opinion of me !
this is the estimation in which you hold me !
i thank you for explaining it so fully .
my faults ,  according to this calculation ,  are heavy indeed !
but perhaps ,  added he ,  stopping in his walk ,  and turning towards her ,  these offenses might have been overlooked ,  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed ,  had i ,  with greater policy ,  concealed my struggles ,  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified ,  unalloyed inclination ;  by reason ,  by reflection ,  by everything .
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
they were natural and just .
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections — to congratulate myself on the hope of relations ,  whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ;  yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said :  you are mistaken ,  mr. darcy ,  if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way ,  than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you ,  had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this ,  but he said nothing ,  and she continued :  you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious ;  and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
she went on :  from the very beginning — from the first moment ,  i may almost say — of my acquaintance with you ,  your manners ,  impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance ,  your conceit ,  and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others ,  were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ;  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough ,  madam .
i perfectly comprehend your feelings ,  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time ,  and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room ,  and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .
the tumult of her mind ,  was now painfully great .
she knew not how to support herself ,  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour .
her astonishment ,  as she reflected on what had passed ,  was increased by every review of it .
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister ,  and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case — was almost incredible !
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .
but his pride ,  his abominable pride — his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane — his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging ,  though he could not justify it ,  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham ,  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny ,  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .
she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation ,  and hurried her away to her room .
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ;  it was impossible to think of anything else ;  and ,  totally indisposed for employment ,  she resolved ,  soon after breakfast ,  to indulge herself in air and exercise .
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk ,  when the recollection of mr. darcys sometimes coming there stopped her ,  and instead of entering the park ,  she turned up the lane ,  which led farther from the turnpikeroad .
the park paling was still the boundary on one side ,  and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane ,  she was tempted ,  by the pleasantness of the morning ,  to stop at the gates and look into the park .
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country ,  and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .
she was on the point of continuing her walk ,  when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ;  he was moving that way ;  and ,  fearful of its being mr. darcy ,  she was directly retreating .
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her ,  and stepping forward with eagerness ,  pronounced her name .
she had turned away ;  but on hearing herself called ,  though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy ,  she moved again towards the gate .
he had by that time reached it also ,  and ,  holding out a letter ,  which she instinctively took ,  said ,  with a look of haughty composure ,  i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then ,  with a slight bow ,  turned again into the plantation ,  and was soon out of sight .
with no expectation of pleasure ,  but with the strongest curiosity ,  elizabeth opened the letter ,  and ,  to her still increasing wonder ,  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper ,  written quite through ,  in a very close hand .
the envelope itself was likewise full .
pursuing her way along the lane ,  she then began it .
it was dated from rosings ,  at eight oclock in the morning ,  and was as follows :  —  be not alarmed ,  madam ,  on receiving this letter ,  by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you .
i write without any intention of paining you ,  or humbling myself ,  by dwelling on wishes which ,  for the happiness of both ,  cannot be too soon forgotten ;  and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion ,  should have been spared ,  had not my character required it to be written and read .
you must ,  therefore ,  pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ;  your feelings ,  i know ,  will bestow it unwillingly ,  but i demand it of your justice .
two offenses of a very different nature ,  and by no means of equal magnitude ,  you last night laid to my charge .
the first mentioned was ,  that ,  regardless of the sentiments of either ,  i had detached mr. bingley from your sister ,  and the other ,  that i had ,  in defiance of various claims ,  in defiance of honour and humanity ,  ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth ,  the acknowledged favourite of my father ,  a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage ,  and who had been brought up to expect its exertion ,  would be a depravity ,  to which the separation of two young persons ,  whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks ,  could bear no comparison .
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed ,  respecting each circumstance ,  i shall hope to be in the future secured ,  when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .
if ,  in the explanation of them ,  which is due to myself ,  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours ,  i can only say that i am sorry .
the necessity must be obeyed ,  and further apology would be absurd .
i had not been long in hertfordshire ,  before i saw ,  in common with others ,  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .
i had often seen him in love before .
at that ball ,  while i had the honour of dancing with you ,  i was first made acquainted ,  by sir william lucass accidental information ,  that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .
he spoke of it as a certain event ,  of which the time alone could be undecided .
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively ;  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .
your sister i also watched .
her look and manners were open ,  cheerful ,  and engaging as ever ,  but without any symptom of peculiar regard ,  and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny ,  that though she received his attentions with pleasure ,  she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .
if you have not been mistaken here ,  i must have been in error .
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .
if it be so ,  if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her ,  your resentment has not been unreasonable .
but i shall not scruple to assert ,  that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that ,  however amiable her temper ,  her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain — but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ;  i believed it on impartial conviction ,  as truly as i wished it in reason .
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside ,  in my own case ;  the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .
but there were other causes of repugnance ;  causes which ,  though still existing ,  and existing to an equal degree in both instances ,  i had myself endeavoured to forget ,  because they were not immediately before me .
these causes must be stated ,  though briefly .
the situation of your mothers family ,  though objectionable ,  was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently ,  so almost uniformly betrayed by herself ,  by your three younger sisters ,  and occasionally even by your father .
pardon me .
it pains me to offend you .
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations ,  and your displeasure at this representation of them ,  let it give you consolation to consider that ,  to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure ,  is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister ,  than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening ,  my opinion of all parties was confirmed ,  and every inducement heightened which could have led me before ,  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .
he left netherfield for london ,  on the day following ,  as you ,  i am certain ,  remember ,  with the design of soon returning .
the part which i acted is now to be explained .
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ;  our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ,  and ,  alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother ,  we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .
we accordingly went — and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice .
i described ,  and enforced them earnestly .
but ,  however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination ,  i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage ,  had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving ,  of your sisters indifference .
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere ,  if not with equal regard .
but bingley has great natural modesty ,  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own .
to convince him ,  therefore ,  that he had deceived himself ,  was no very difficult point .
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire ,  when that conviction had been given ,  was scarcely the work of a moment .
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ;  it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town .
i knew it myself ,  as it was known to miss bingley ;  but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ;  but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .
perhaps this concealment ,  this disguise was beneath me ;  it is done ,  however ,  and it was done for the best .
on this subject i have nothing more to say ,  no other apology to offer .
if i have wounded your sisters feelings ,  it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient ,  i have not yet learnt to condemn them .
with respect to that other ,  more weighty accusation ,  of having injured mr. wickham ,  i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ;  but of the truth of what i shall relate ,  i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
mr .
wickham is the son of a very respectable man ,  who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ,  and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ;  and on george wickham ,  who was his godson ,  his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .
my father supported him at school ,  and afterwards at cambridge — most important assistance ,  as his own father ,  always poor from the extravagance of his wife ,  would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education .
my father was not only fond of this young mans society ,  whose manners were always engaging ;  he had also the highest opinion of him ,  and hoping the church would be his profession ,  intended to provide for him in it .
as for myself ,  it is many ,  many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
the vicious propensities — the want of principle ,  which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend ,  could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself ,  and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments ,  which mr. darcy could not have .
here again i shall give you pain — to what degree you only can tell .
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created ,  a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character — it adds even another motive .
my excellent father died about five years ago ;  and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady ,  that in his will he particularly recommended it to me ,  to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow — and if he took orders ,  desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant .
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
his own father did not long survive mine ,  and within half a year from these events ,  mr. wickham wrote to inform me that ,  having finally resolved against taking orders ,  he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage ,  in lieu of the preferment ,  by which he could not be benefited .
he had some intention ,  he added ,  of studying law ,  and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .
i rather wished ,  than believed him to be sincere ;  but ,  at any rate ,  was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman ;  the business was therefore soon settled — he resigned all claim to assistance in the church ,  were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it ,  and accepted in return three thousand pounds .
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley ,  or admit his society in town .
in town i believe he chiefly lived ,  but his studying the law was a mere pretence ,  and being now free from all restraint ,  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
for about three years i heard little of him ;  but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him ,  he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .
his circumstances ,  he assured me ,  and i had no difficulty in believing it ,  were exceedingly bad .
he had found the law a most unprofitable study ,  and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained ,  if i would present him to the living in question — of which he trusted there could be little doubt ,  as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for ,  and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions .
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty ,  or for resisting every repetition to it .
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances — and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself .
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped .
how he lived i know not .
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself ,  and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
having said thus much ,  i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
my sister ,  who is more than ten years my junior ,  was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew ,  colonel fitzwilliam ,  and myself .
about a year ago ,  she was taken from school ,  and an establishment formed for her in london ;  and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it ,  to ramsgate ;  and thither also went mr. wickham ,  undoubtedly by design ;  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge ,  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ;  and by her connivance and aid ,  he so far recommended himself to georgiana ,  whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child ,  that she was persuaded to believe herself in love ,  and to consent to an elopement .
she was then but fifteen ,  which must be her excuse ;  and after stating her imprudence ,  i am happy to add ,  that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ,  and then georgiana ,  unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father ,  acknowledged the whole to me .
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .
regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ;  but i wrote to mr. wickham ,  who left the place immediately ,  and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .
mr. wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune ,  which is thirty thousand pounds ;  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement .
his revenge would have been complete indeed .
this ,  madam ,  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ;  and if you do not absolutely reject it as false ,  you will ,  i hope ,  acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .
i know not in what manner ,  under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you ;  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either ,  detection could not be in your power ,  and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ;  but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .
for the truth of everything here related ,  i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam ,  who ,  from our near relationship and constant intimacy ,  and ,  still more ,  as one of the executors of my fathers will ,  has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless ,  you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ;  and that there may be the possibility of consulting him ,  i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .
i will only add ,  god bless you .
fitzwilliam darcy if elizabeth ,  when mr. darcy gave her the letter ,  did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers ,  she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
but such as they were ,  it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them ,  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ;  and steadfastly was she persuaded ,  that he could have no explanation to give ,  which a just sense of shame would not conceal .
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say ,  she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension ,  and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring ,  was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false ;  and his account of the real ,  the worst objections to the match ,  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ;  his style was not penitent ,  but haughty .
it was all pride and insolence .
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham — when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which ,  if true ,  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth ,  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself — her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .
astonishment ,  apprehension ,  and even horror ,  oppressed her .
she wished to discredit it entirely ,  repeatedly exclaiming ,  this must be false !
this cannot be !
this must be the grossest falsehood — and when she had gone through the whole letter ,  though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two ,  put it hastily away ,  protesting that she would not regard it ,  that she would never look in it again .
in this perturbed state of mind ,  with thoughts that could rest on nothing ,  she walked on ;  but it would not do ;  in half a minute the letter was unfolded again ,  and collecting herself as well as she could ,  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham ,  and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ;  and the kindness of the late mr. darcy ,  though she had not before known its extent ,  agreed equally well with his own words .
so far each recital confirmed the other ;  but when she came to the will ,  the difference was great .
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory ,  and as she recalled his very words ,  it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ;  and ,  for a few moments ,  she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .
but when she read and reread with the closest attention ,  the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living ,  of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds ,  again was she forced to hesitate .
she put down the letter ,  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality — deliberated on the probability of each statement — but with little success .
on both sides it was only assertion .
again she read on ;  but every line proved more clearly that the affair ,  which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr. darcys conduct in it less than infamous ,  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr. wickhams charge ,  exceedingly shocked her ;  the more so ,  as she could bring no proof of its injustice .
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the  —  — shire militia ,  in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who ,  on meeting him accidentally in town ,  had there renewed a slight acquaintance .
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .
as to his real character ,  had information been in her power ,  she had never felt a wish of inquiring .
his countenance ,  voice ,  and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness ,  some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence ,  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ;  or at least ,  by the predominance of virtue ,  atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .
but no such recollection befriended her .
she could see him instantly before her ,  in every charm of air and address ;  but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood ,  and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .
after pausing on this point a considerable while ,  she once more continued to read .
but ,  alas !
the story which followed ,  of his designs on miss darcy ,  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ;  and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself — from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs ,  and whose character she had no reason to question .
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him ,  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application ,  and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal ,  if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration .
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself ,  in their first evening at mr. phillipss .
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger ,  and wondered it had escaped her before .
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done ,  and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy — that mr. darcy might leave the country ,  but that he should stand his ground ;  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .
she remembered also that ,  till the netherfield family had quitted the country ,  he had told his story to no one but herself ;  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed ;  that he had then no reserves ,  no scruples in sinking mr. darcys character ,  though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son .
how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned !
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ;  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes ,  but his eagerness to grasp at anything .
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ;  he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune ,  or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown .
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ;  and in farther justification of mr. darcy ,  she could not but allow that mr. bingley ,  when questioned by jane ,  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ;  that proud and repulsive as were his manners ,  she had never ,  in the whole course of their acquaintance — an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together ,  and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways — seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust — anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits ;  that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued — that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother ,  and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling ;  that had his actions been what mr. wickham represented them ,  so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world ;  and that friendship between a person capable of it ,  and such an amiable man as mr. bingley ,  was incomprehensible .
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind ,  partial ,  prejudiced ,  absurd .
how despicably i have acted she cried ;  i ,  who have prided myself on my discernment !
i ,  who have valued myself on my abilities !
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister ,  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust !
how humiliating is this discovery !
yet ,  how just a humiliation !
had i been in love ,  i could not have been more wretchedly blind !
but vanity ,  not love ,  has been my folly .
pleased with the preference of one ,  and offended by the neglect of the other ,  on the very beginning of our acquaintance ,  i have courted prepossession and ignorance ,  and driven reason away ,  where either were concerned .
till this moment i never knew myself from herself to jane — from jane to bingley ,  her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient ,  and she read it again .
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance ,  which she had been obliged to give in the other ?
he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment ;  and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been .
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .
she felt that janes feelings ,  though fervent ,  were little displayed ,  and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility .
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying ,  yet merited reproach ,  her sense of shame was severe .
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial ,  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball ,  and as confirming all his first disapprobation ,  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt .
it soothed ,  but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family ;  and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations ,  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct ,  she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before .
after wandering along the lane for two hours ,  giving way to every variety of thought — reconsidering events ,  determining probabilities ,  and reconciling herself ,  as well as she could ,  to a change so sudden and so important ,  fatigue ,  and a recollection of her long absence ,  made her at length return home ;  and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual ,  and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ;  mr. darcy ,  only for a few minutes ,  to take leave — but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour ,  hoping for her return ,  and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ;  she really rejoiced at it .
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object ;  she could think only of her letter .
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ,  and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges ,  to make them his parting obeisance ,  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence ,  of their appearing in very good health ,  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected ,  after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .
to rosings he then hastened ,  to console lady catherine and her daughter ;  and on his return brought back ,  with great satisfaction ,  a message from her ladyship ,  importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that ,  had she chosen it ,  she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece ;  nor could she think ,  without a smile ,  of what her ladyships indignation would have been .
what would she have said ?
how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself .
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .
i assure you ,  i feel it exceedingly ,  said lady catherine ;  i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do .
but i am particularly attached to these young men ,  and know them to be so much attached to me !
they were excessively sorry to go !
but so they always are .
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ;  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely ,  more ,  i think ,  than last year .
his attachment to rosings certainly increases mr. collins had a compliment ,  and an allusion to throw in here ,  which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .
lady catherine observed ,  after dinner ,  that miss bennet seemed out of spirits ,  and immediately accounting for it by herself ,  by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon ,  she added :  but if that is the case ,  you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer .
mrs. collins will be very glad of your company ,  i am sure i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation ,  replied elizabeth ,  but it is not in my power to accept it .
i must be in town next saturday why ,  at that rate ,  you will have been here only six weeks .
i expected you to stay two months .
i told mrs. collins so before you came .
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .
mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot .
he wrote last week to hurry my return oh !
your father of course may spare you ,  if your mother can .
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .
and if you will stay another month complete ,  it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london ,  for i am going there early in june ,  for a week ;  and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox ,  there will be very good room for one of you — and indeed ,  if the weather should happen to be cool ,  i should not object to taking you both ,  as you are neither of you large you are all kindness ,  madam ;  but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned .
mrs .
collins ,  you must send a servant with them .
you know i always speak my mind ,  and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .
it is highly improper .
you must contrive to send somebody .
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .
young women should always be properly guarded and attended ,  according to their situation in life .
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer ,  i made a point of her having two menservants go with her .
miss darcy ,  the daughter of mr. darcy ,  of pemberley ,  and lady anne ,  could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .
i am excessively attentive to all those things .
you must send john with the young ladies ,  mrs. collins .
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ;  for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh !
your uncle !
he keeps a manservant ,  does he ?
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things .
where shall you change horses ?
oh !
bromley ,  of course .
if you mention my name at the bell ,  you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey ,  and as she did not answer them all herself ,  attention was necessary ,  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ;  or ,  with a mind so occupied ,  she might have forgotten where she was .
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ;  whenever she was alone ,  she gave way to it as the greatest relief ;  and not a day went by without a solitary walk ,  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .
mr. darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .
she studied every sentence ;  and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .
when she remembered the style of his address ,  she was still full of indignation ;  but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him ,  her anger was turned against herself ;  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
his attachment excited gratitude ,  his general character respect ;  but she could not approve him ;  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal ,  or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .
in her own past behaviour ,  there was a constant source of vexation and regret ;  and in the unhappy defects of her family ,  a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
they were hopeless of remedy .
her father ,  contented with laughing at them ,  would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ;  and her mother ,  with manners so far from right herself ,  was entirely insensible of the evil .
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ;  but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence ,  what chance could there be of improvement ?
catherine ,  weakspirited ,  irritable ,  and completely under lydias guidance ,  had been always affronted by their advice ;  and lydia ,  selfwilled and careless ,  would scarcely give them a hearing .
they were ignorant ,  idle ,  and vain .
while there was an officer in meryton ,  they would flirt with him ;  and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn ,  they would be going there forever .
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern ;  and mr. darcys explanation ,  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion ,  heightened the sense of what jane had lost .
his affection was proved to have been sincere ,  and his conduct cleared of all blame ,  unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .
how grievous then was the thought that ,  of a situation so desirable in every respect ,  so replete with advantage ,  so promising for happiness ,  jane had been deprived ,  by the folly and indecorum of her own family !
when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character ,  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before ,  were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first .
the very last evening was spent there ;  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey ,  gave them directions as to the best method of packing ,  and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way ,  that maria thought herself obliged ,  on her return ,  to undo all the work of the morning ,  and pack her trunk afresh .
when they parted ,  lady catherine ,  with great condescension ,  wished them a good journey ,  and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ;  and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ;  and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .
i know not ,  miss elizabeth ,  said he ,  whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ;  but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .
the favour of your company has been much felt ,  i assure you .
we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode .
our plain manner of living ,  our small rooms and few domestics ,  and the little we see of the world ,  must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ;  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension ,  and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ;  and the pleasure of being with charlotte ,  and the kind attentions she had received ,  must make her feel the obliged .
mr. collins was gratified ,  and with a more smiling solemnity replied :  it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .
we have certainly done our best ;  and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society ,  and ,  from our connection with rosings ,  the frequent means of varying the humble home scene ,  i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .
our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .
you see on what a footing we are .
you see how continually we are engaged there .
in truth i must acknowledge that ,  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage ,  i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion ,  while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ;  and he was obliged to walk about the room ,  while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .
you may ,  in fact ,  carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire ,  my dear cousin .
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .
lady catherines great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ;  and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate — but on this point it will be as well to be silent .
only let me assure you ,  my dear miss elizabeth ,  that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .
there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .
we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case ,  and with equal sincerity could add ,  that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .
she was not sorry ,  however ,  to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang .
poor charlotte !
it was melancholy to leave her to such society !
but she had chosen it with her eyes open ;  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go ,  she did not seem to ask for compassion .
her home and her housekeeping ,  her parish and her poultry ,  and all their dependent concerns ,  had not yet lost their charms .
at length the chaise arrived ,  the trunks were fastened on ,  the parcels placed within ,  and it was pronounced to be ready .
after an affectionate parting between the friends ,  elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins ,  and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family ,  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter ,  and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner ,  though unknown .
he then handed her in ,  maria followed ,  and the door was on the point of being closed ,  when he suddenly reminded them ,  with some consternation ,  that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings .
but ,  he added ,  you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them ,  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection ;  the door was then allowed to be shut ,  and the carriage drove off .
good gracious cried maria ,  after a few minutes silence ,  it seems but a day or two since we first came !
and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed ,  said her companion with a sigh .
we have dined nine times at rosings ,  besides drinking tea there twice !
how much i shall have to tell elizabeth added privately ,  and how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation ,  or any alarm ;  and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiners house ,  where they were to remain a few days .
jane looked well ,  and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits ,  amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .
but jane was to go home with her ,  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .
it was not without an effort ,  meanwhile ,  that she could wait even for longbourn ,  before she told her sister of mr. darcys proposals .
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane ,  and must ,  at the same time ,  so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away ,  was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate ;  and her fear ,  if she once entered on the subject ,  of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further .
it was the second week in may ,  in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of  —  —  ,  in hertfordshire ;  and ,  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennets carriage was to meet them ,  they quickly perceived ,  in token of the coachmans punctuality ,  both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs .
these two girls had been above an hour in the place ,  happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner ,  watching the sentinel on guard ,  and dressing a salad and cucumber .
after welcoming their sisters ,  they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords ,  exclaiming ,  is not this nice ?
is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all ,  added lydia ,  but you must lend us the money ,  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then ,  showing her purchases — look here ,  i have bought this bonnet .
i do not think it is very pretty ;  but i thought i might as well buy it as not .
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home ,  and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly ,  she added ,  with perfect unconcern ,  oh !
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ;  and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh ,  i think it will be very tolerable .
besides ,  it will not much signify what one wears this summer ,  after the  —  — shire have left meryton ,  and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cried elizabeth ,  with the greatest satisfaction .
they are going to be encamped near brighton ;  and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !
it would be such a delicious scheme ;  and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all .
mamma would like to go too of all things !
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes ,  thought elizabeth ,  that would be a delightful scheme indeed ,  and completely do for us at once .
good heaven !
brighton ,  and a whole campful of soldiers ,  to us ,  who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia ,  and the monthly balls of meryton now i have got some news for you ,  said lydia ,  as they sat down at table .
what do you think ?
it is excellent news — capital news — and about a certain person we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other ,  and the waiter was told he need not stay .
lydia laughed ,  and said :  aye ,  that is just like your formality and discretion .
you thought the waiter must not hear ,  as if he cared !
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .
but he is an ugly fellow !
i am glad he is gone .
i never saw such a long chin in my life .
well ,  but now for my news ;  it is about dear wickham ;  too good for the waiter ,  is it not ?
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king .
theres for you !
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool :  gone to stay .
wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth ;  safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away ,  if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side ,  said jane .
i am sure there is not on his .
i will answer for it ,  he never cared three straws about her — who could about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that ,  however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself ,  the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal !
as soon as all had ate ,  and the elder ones paid ,  the carriage was ordered ;  and after some contrivance ,  the whole party ,  with all their boxes ,  workbags ,  and parcels ,  and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases ,  were seated in it .
how nicely we are all crammed in ,  cried lydia .
i am glad i bought my bonnet ,  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !
well ,  now let us be quite comfortable and snug ,  and talk and laugh all the way home .
and in the first place ,  let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away .
have you seen any pleasant men ?
have you had any flirting ?
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .
jane will be quite an old maid soon ,  i declare .
she is almost threeandtwenty !
lord ,  how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty !
my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands ,  you cant think .
she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ;  but i do not think there would have been any fun in it .
lord !
how i should like to be married before any of you ;  and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .
dear me !
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters .
kitty and me were to spend the day there ,  and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ;  by the bye ,  mrs. forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come ,  but harriet was ill ,  and so pen was forced to come by herself ;  and then ,  what do you think we did ?
we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady ,  only think what fun !
not a soul knew of it ,  but colonel and mrs. forster ,  and kitty and me ,  except my aunt ,  for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ;  and you cannot imagine how well he looked !
when denny ,  and wickham ,  and pratt ,  and two or three more of the men came in ,  they did not know him in the least .
lord !
how i laughed !
and so did mrs. forster .
i thought i should have died .
and that made the men suspect something ,  and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes ,  did lydia ,  assisted by kittys hints and additions ,  endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .
elizabeth listened as little as she could ,  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name .
their reception at home was most kind .
mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ;  and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth :  i am glad you are come back ,  lizzy their party in the diningroom was large ,  for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news ;  and various were the subjects that occupied them :  lady lucas was inquiring of maria ,  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ;  mrs. bennet was doubly engaged ,  on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane ,  who sat some way below her ,  and ,  on the other ,  retailing them all to the younger lucases ;  and lydia ,  in a voice rather louder than any other persons ,  was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her .
oh !
mary ,  said she ,  i wish you had gone with us ,  for we had such fun !
as we went along ,  kitty and i drew up the blinds ,  and pretended there was nobody in the coach ;  and i should have gone so all the way ,  if kitty had not been sick ;  and when we got to the george ,  i do think we behaved very handsomely ,  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world ,  and if you would have gone ,  we would have treated you too .
and then when we came away it was such fun !
i thought we never should have got into the coach .
i was ready to die of laughter .
and then we were so merry all the way home !
we talked and laughed so loud ,  that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied ,  far be it from me ,  my dear sister ,  to depreciate such pleasures !
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .
but i confess they would have no charms for me — i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute ,  and never attended to mary at all .
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton ,  and to see how everybody went on ;  but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .
there was another reason too for her opposition .
she dreaded seeing mr. wickham again ,  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .
the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression .
in a fortnight they were to go — and once gone ,  she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme ,  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn ,  was under frequent discussion between her parents .
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ;  but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal ,  that her mother ,  though often disheartened ,  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ;  and at length ,  resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned ,  and preparing her to be surprised ,  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ;  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .
she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ;  but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him .
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong ,  said she ,  and certainly ought not to have appeared ;  but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed ,  replied elizabeth ,  i am heartily sorry for him ;  but he has other feelings ,  which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .
you do not blame me ,  however ,  for refusing him blame you !
oh ,  no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham no — i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you will know it ,  when i tell you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter ,  repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .
what a stroke was this for poor jane !
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind ,  as was here collected in one individual .
nor was darcys vindication ,  though grateful to her feelings ,  capable of consoling her for such discovery .
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error ,  and seek to clear the one without involving the other .
this will not do ,  said elizabeth ;  you never will be able to make both of them good for anything .
take your choice ,  but you must be satisfied with only one .
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ;  just enough to make one good sort of man ;  and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
for my part ,  i am inclined to believe it all darcys ;  but you shall do as you choose it was some time ,  however ,  before a smile could be extorted from jane .
i do not know when i have been more shocked ,  said she .
wickham so very bad !
it is almost past belief .
and poor mr. darcy !
dear lizzy ,  only consider what he must have suffered .
such a disappointment !
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion ,  too !
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
it is really too distressing .
i am sure you must feel it so oh !
no ,  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
i know you will do him such ample justice ,  that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
your profusion makes me saving ;  and if you lament over him much longer ,  my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham !
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !
such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
one has got all the goodness ,  and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him ,  without any reason .
it is such a spur to ones genius ,  such an opening for wit ,  to have a dislike of that kind .
one may be continually abusive without saying anything just ;  but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy ,  when you first read that letter ,  i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed ,  i could not .
i was uncomfortable enough ,  i may say unhappy .
and with no one to speak to about what i felt ,  no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !
oh !
how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy ,  for now they do appear wholly undeserved certainly .
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .
there is one point on which i want your advice .
i want to be told whether i ought ,  or ought not ,  to make our acquaintances in general understand wickhams character miss bennet paused a little ,  and then replied ,  surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
what is your opinion that it ought not to be attempted .
mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .
on the contrary ,  every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ;  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct ,  who will believe me ?
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent ,  that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
i am not equal to it .
wickham will soon be gone ;  and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is .
some time hence it will be all found out ,  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .
at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right .
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
he is now ,  perhaps ,  sorry for what he has done ,  and anxious to reestablish a character .
we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation .
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight ,  and was certain of a willing listener in jane ,  whenever she might wish to talk again of either .
but there was still something lurking behind ,  of which prudence forbade the disclosure .
she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcys letter ,  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend .
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ;  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery .
and then ,  said she ,  if that very improbable event should ever take place ,  i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now ,  on being settled at home ,  at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits .
jane was not happy .
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
having never even fancied herself in love before ,  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment ,  and ,  from her age and disposition ,  greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast ;  and so fervently did she value his remembrance ,  and prefer him to every other man ,  that all her good sense ,  and all her attention to the feelings of her friends ,  were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .
well ,  lizzy ,  said mrs. bennet one day ,  what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes ?
for my part ,  i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .
i told my sister phillips so the other day .
but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london .
well ,  he is a very undeserving young man — and i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ;  and i have inquired of everybody ,  too ,  who is likely to know i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well !
it is just as he chooses .
nobody wants him to come .
though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ;  and if i was her ,  i would not have put up with it .
well ,  my comfort is ,  i am sure jane will die of a broken heart ;  and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation ,  she made no answer .
well ,  lizzy ,  continued her mother ,  soon afterwards ,  and so the collinses live very comfortable ,  do they ?
well ,  well ,  i only hope it will last .
and what sort of table do they keep ?
charlotte is an excellent manager ,  i dare say .
if she is half as sharp as her mother ,  she is saving enough .
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping ,  i dare say no ,  nothing at all a great deal of good management ,  depend upon it .
yes ,  yes .
they will take care not to outrun their income .
they will never be distressed for money .
well ,  much good may it do them !
and so ,  i suppose ,  they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
they look upon it as quite their own ,  i dare say ,  whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me no ;  it would have been strange if they had ;  but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves .
well ,  if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own ,  so much the better .
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me the first week of their return was soon gone .
the second began .
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton ,  and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .
the dejection was almost universal .
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat ,  drink ,  and sleep ,  and pursue the usual course of their employments .
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia ,  whose own misery was extreme ,  and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family .
good heaven !
what is to become of us ?
what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
how can you be smiling so ,  lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief ;  she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion ,  fiveandtwenty years ago .
i am sure ,  said she ,  i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away .
i thought i should have broken my heart i am sure i shall break mine ,  said lydia .
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs. bennet .
oh ,  yes — if one could but go to brighton !
but papa is so disagreeable a little seabathing would set me up forever and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good ,  added kitty .
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house .
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ;  but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcys objections ;  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away ;  for she received an invitation from mrs. forster ,  the wife of the colonel of the regiment ,  to accompany her to brighton .
this invaluable friend was a very young woman ,  and very lately married .
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other ,  and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two .
the rapture of lydia on this occasion ,  her adoration of mrs. forster ,  the delight of mrs. bennet ,  and the mortification of kitty ,  are scarcely to be described .
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings ,  lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy ,  calling for everyones congratulations ,  and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ;  whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .
i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia ,  said she ,  though i am not her particular friend .
i have just as much right to be asked as she has ,  and more too ,  for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable ,  and jane to make her resigned .
as for elizabeth herself ,  this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia ,  that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ;  and detestable as such a step must make her were it known ,  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour ,  the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster ,  and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton ,  where the temptations must be greater than at home .
he heard her attentively ,  and then said :  lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other ,  and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware ,  said elizabeth ,  of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner — nay ,  which has already arisen from it ,  i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr. bennet .
what ,  has she frightened away some of your lovers ?
poor little lizzy !
but do not be cast down .
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret .
come ,  let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly indeed you are mistaken .
i have no such injuries to resent .
it is not of particular ,  but of general evils ,  which i am now complaining .
our importance ,  our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility ,  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character .
excuse me ,  for i must speak plainly .
if you ,  my dear father ,  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits ,  and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life ,  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .
her character will be fixed ,  and she will ,  at sixteen ,  be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ;  a flirt ,  too ,  in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ;  without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ;  and ,  from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind ,  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .
in this danger kitty also is comprehended .
she will follow wherever lydia leads .
vain ,  ignorant ,  idle ,  and absolutely uncontrolled !
oh !
my dear father ,  can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known ,  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ,  and affectionately taking her hand said in reply :  do not make yourself uneasy ,  my love .
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued ;  and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of — or i may say ,  three — very silly sisters .
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .
let her go ,  then .
colonel forster is a sensible man ,  and will keep her out of any real mischief ;  and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody .
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .
the officers will find women better worth their notice .
let us hope ,  therefore ,  that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .
at any rate ,  she cannot grow many degrees worse ,  without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ;  but her own opinion continued the same ,  and she left him disappointed and sorry .
it was not in her nature ,  however ,  to increase her vexations by dwelling on them .
she was confident of having performed her duty ,  and to fret over unavoidable evils ,  or augment them by anxiety ,  was no part of her disposition .
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father ,  their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .
in lydias imagination ,  a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .
she saw ,  with the creative eye of fancy ,  the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers .
she saw herself the object of attention ,  to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .
she saw all the glories of the camp — its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines ,  crowded with the young and the gay ,  and dazzling with scarlet ;  and ,  to complete the view ,  she saw herself seated beneath a tent ,  tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .
had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these ,  what would have been her sensations ?
they could have been understood only by her mother ,  who might have felt nearly the same .
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself .
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ;  and their raptures continued ,  with little intermission ,  to the very day of lydias leaving home .
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time .
having been frequently in company with him since her return ,  agitation was pretty well over ;  the agitations of former partiality entirely so .
she had even learnt to detect ,  in the very gentleness which had first delighted her ,  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .
in his present behaviour to herself ,  moreover ,  she had a fresh source of displeasure ,  for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve ,  after what had since passed ,  to provoke her .
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ;  and while she steadily repressed it ,  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing ,  that however long ,  and for whatever cause ,  his attentions had been withdrawn ,  her vanity would be gratified ,  and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .
on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton ,  he dined ,  with other of the officers ,  at longbourn ;  and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour ,  that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford ,  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr. darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings ,  and asked him ,  if he was acquainted with the former .
he looked surprised ,  displeased ,  alarmed ;  but with a moments recollection and a returning smile ,  replied ,  that he had formerly seen him often ;  and ,  after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man ,  asked her how she had liked him .
her answer was warmly in his favour .
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added :  how long did you say he was at rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes ,  almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes ,  very different .
but i think mr. darcy improves upon acquaintance indeed cried mr. wickham with a look which did not escape her .
and pray ,  may i ask —  but checking himself ,  he added ,  in a gayer tone ,  is it in address that he improves ?
has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style — for i dare not hope ,  he continued in a lower and more serious tone ,  that he is improved in essentials oh ,  no said elizabeth .
in essentials ,  i believe ,  he is very much what he ever was while she spoke ,  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words ,  or to distrust their meaning .
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention ,  while she added :  when i said that he improved on acquaintance ,  i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement ,  but that ,  from knowing him better ,  his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ;  for a few minutes he was silent ,  till ,  shaking off his embarrassment ,  he turned to her again ,  and said in the gentlest of accents :  you ,  who so well know my feeling towards mr. darcy ,  will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .
his pride ,  in that direction ,  may be of service ,  if not to himself ,  to many others ,  for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you ,  i imagine ,  have been alluding ,  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt ,  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe .
his fear of her has always operated ,  i know ,  when they were together ;  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh ,  which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this ,  but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances ,  and she was in no humour to indulge him .
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance ,  on his side ,  of usual cheerfulness ,  but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth ;  and they parted at last with mutual civility ,  and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .
when the party broke up ,  lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton ,  from whence they were to set out early the next morning .
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .
kitty was the only one who shed tears ;  but she did weep from vexation and envy .
mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter ,  and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible — advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ;  and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell ,  the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family ,  she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .
her father ,  captivated by youth and beauty ,  and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give ,  had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .
respect ,  esteem ,  and confidence had vanished for ever ;  and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .
but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on ,  in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .
he was fond of the country and of books ;  and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted ,  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ;  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting ,  the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .
elizabeth ,  however ,  had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband .
she had always seen it with pain ;  but respecting his abilities ,  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself ,  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook ,  and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which ,  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children ,  was so highly reprehensible .
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage ,  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents ;  talents ,  which ,  rightly used ,  might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters ,  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .
their parties abroad were less varied than before ,  and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ;  and ,  though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense ,  since the disturbers of her brain were removed ,  her other sister ,  from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended ,  was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp .
upon the whole ,  therefore ,  she found ,  what has been sometimes found before ,  that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not ,  in taking place ,  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity — to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed ,  and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation ,  console herself for the present ,  and prepare for another disappointment .
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ;  it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ;  and could she have included jane in the scheme ,  every part of it would have been perfect .
but it is fortunate ,  thought she ,  that i have something to wish for .
were the whole arrangement complete ,  my disappointment would be certain .
but here ,  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence ,  i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised .
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ;  and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ;  but her letters were always long expected ,  and always very short .
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library ,  where such and such officers had attended them ,  and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ;  that she had a new gown ,  or a new parasol ,  which she would have described more fully ,  but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry ,  as mrs. forster called her ,  and they were going off to the camp ;  and from her correspondence with her sister ,  there was still less to be learnt — for her letters to kitty ,  though rather longer ,  were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence ,  health ,  good humour ,  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn .
everything wore a happier aspect .
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again ,  and summer finery and summer engagements arose .
mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ;  and ,  by the middle of june ,  kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ;  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day ,  unless ,  by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office ,  another regiment should be quartered in meryton .
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ,  and a fortnight only was wanting of it ,  when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner ,  which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july ,  and must be in london again within a month ,  and as that left too short a period for them to go so far ,  and see so much as they had proposed ,  or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on ,  they were obliged to give up the lakes ,  and substitute a more contracted tour ,  and ,  according to the present plan ,  were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire .
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ;  and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life ,  and where they were now to spend a few days ,  was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock ,  chatsworth ,  dovedale ,  or the peak .
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ;  she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ,  and still thought there might have been time enough .
but it was her business to be satisfied — and certainly her temper to be happy ;  and all was soon right again .
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected .
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .
but surely ,  said she ,  i may enter his county with impunity ,  and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled .
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival .
but they did pass away ,  and mr. and mrs. gardiner ,  with their four children ,  did at length appear at longbourn .
the children ,  two girls of six and eight years old ,  and two younger boys ,  were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane ,  who was the general favourite ,  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way — teaching them ,  playing with them ,  and loving them .
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn ,  and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .
one enjoyment was certain — that of suitableness of companions ;  a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences — cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure — and affection and intelligence ,  which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire ,  nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ;  oxford ,  blenheim ,  warwick ,  kenilworth ,  birmingham ,  etc .
are sufficiently known .
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .
to the little town of lambton ,  the scene of mrs. gardiners former residence ,  and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained ,  they bent their steps ,  after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ;  and within five miles of lambton ,  elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated .
it was not in their direct road ,  nor more than a mile or two out of it .
in talking over their route the evening before ,  mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .
mr. gardiner declared his willingness ,  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .
my love ,  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt ;  a place ,  too ,  with which so many of your acquaintances are connected .
wickham passed all his youth there ,  you know elizabeth was distressed .
she felt that she had no business at pemberley ,  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .
she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ;  after going over so many ,  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished ,  said she ,  i should not care about it myself ;  but the grounds are delightful .
they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more — but her mind could not acquiesce .
the possibility of meeting mr. darcy ,  while viewing the place ,  instantly occurred .
it would be dreadful !
she blushed at the very idea ,  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk .
but against this there were objections ;  and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource ,  if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered .
accordingly ,  when she retired at night ,  she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place ?
what was the name of its proprietor ?
and ,  with no little alarm ,  whether the family were down for the summer ?
a most welcome negative followed the last question — and her alarms now being removed ,  she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ;  and when the subject was revived the next morning ,  and she was again applied to ,  could readily answer ,  and with a proper air of indifference ,  that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .
to pemberley ,  therefore ,  they were to go .
elizabeth ,  as they drove along ,  watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ;  and when at length they turned in at the lodge ,  her spirits were in a high flutter .
the park was very large ,  and contained great variety of ground .
they entered it in one of its lowest points ,  and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent .
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation ,  but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .
they gradually ascended for halfamile ,  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence ,  where the wood ceased ,  and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house ,  situated on the opposite side of a valley ,  into which the road with some abruptness wound .
it was a large ,  handsome stone building ,  standing well on rising ground ,  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ;  and in front ,  a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater ,  but without any artificial appearance .
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned .
elizabeth was delighted .
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more ,  or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .
they were all of them warm in their admiration ;  and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !
they descended the hill ,  crossed the bridge ,  and drove to the door ;  and ,  while examining the nearer aspect of the house ,  all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned .
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .
on applying to see the place ,  they were admitted into the hall ;  and elizabeth ,  as they waited for the housekeeper ,  had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .
the housekeeper came ;  a respectablelooking elderly woman ,  much less fine ,  and more civil ,  than she had any notion of finding her .
they followed her into the diningparlour .
it was a large ,  well proportioned room ,  handsomely fitted up .
elizabeth ,  after slightly surveying it ,  went to a window to enjoy its prospect .
the hill ,  crowned with wood ,  which they had descended ,  receiving increased abruptness from the distance ,  was a beautiful object .
every disposition of the ground was good ;  and she looked on the whole scene ,  the river ,  the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley ,  as far as she could trace it ,  with delight .
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions ;  but from every window there were beauties to be seen .
the rooms were lofty and handsome ,  and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor ;  but elizabeth saw ,  with admiration of his taste ,  that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ;  with less of splendour ,  and more real elegance ,  than the furniture of rosings .
and of this place ,  thought she ,  i might have been mistress !
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !
instead of viewing them as a stranger ,  i might have rejoiced in them as my own ,  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .
but no ,  — recollecting herself — that could never be ;  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ;  i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollection — it saved her from something very like regret .
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent ,  but had not the courage for it .
at length however ,  the question was asked by her uncle ;  and she turned away with alarm ,  while mrs. reynolds replied that he was ,  adding ,  but we expect him tomorrow ,  with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .
she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham ,  suspended ,  amongst several other miniatures ,  over the mantelpiece .
her aunt asked her ,  smilingly ,  how she liked it .
the housekeeper came forward ,  and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman ,  the son of her late masters steward ,  who had been brought up by him at his own expense .
he is now gone into the army ,  she added ;  but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile ,  but elizabeth could not return it .
and that ,  said mrs. reynolds ,  pointing to another of the miniatures ,  is my master — and very like him .
it was drawn at the same time as the other — about eight years ago i have heard much of your masters fine person ,  said mrs. gardiner ,  looking at the picture ;  it is a handsome face .
but ,  lizzy ,  you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
does that young lady know mr. darcy elizabeth coloured ,  and said :  a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ,  maam yes ,  very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome ;  but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer ,  larger picture of him than this .
this room was my late masters favourite room ,  and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .
he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickhams being among them .
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy ,  drawn when she was only eight years old .
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mrs. gardiner .
oh !
yes — the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ;  and so accomplished — she plays and sings all day long .
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her — a present from my master ;  she comes here tomorrow with him mr. gardiner ,  whose manners were very easy and pleasant ,  encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ;  mrs. reynolds ,  either by pride or attachment ,  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish ,  sir ;  but i dare say he may spend half his time here ;  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except ,  thought elizabeth ,  when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry ,  you might see more of him yes ,  sir ;  but i do not know when that will be .
i do not know who is good enough for him mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled .
elizabeth could not help saying ,  it is very much to his credit ,  i am sure ,  that you should think so i say no more than the truth ,  and everybody will say that knows him ,  replied the other .
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ;  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added ,  i have never known a cross word from him in my life ,  and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise ,  of all others most extraordinary ,  most opposite to her ideas .
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion .
her keenest attention was awakened ;  she longed to hear more ,  and was grateful to her uncle for saying :  there are very few people of whom so much can be said .
you are lucky in having such a master yes ,  sir ,  i know i am .
if i were to go through the world ,  i could not meet with a better .
but i have always observed ,  that they who are goodnatured when children ,  are goodnatured when they grow up ;  and he was always the sweetesttempered ,  most generoushearted boy in the world elizabeth almost stared at her .
can this be mr. darcy thought she .
his father was an excellent man ,  said mrs. gardiner .
yes ,  maam ,  that he was indeed ;  and his son will be just like him — just as affable to the poor elizabeth listened ,  wondered ,  doubted ,  and was impatient for more .
mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point .
she related the subjects of the pictures ,  the dimensions of the rooms ,  and the price of the furniture ,  in vain .
mr. gardiner ,  highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master ,  soon led again to the subject ;  and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase .
he is the best landlord ,  and the best master ,  said she ,  that ever lived ;  not like the wild young men nowadays ,  who think of nothing but themselves .
there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name .
some people call him proud ;  but i am sure i never saw anything of it .
to my fancy ,  it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth .
this fine account of him ,  whispered her aunt as they walked ,  is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely ;  our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom ,  lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ;  and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy ,  who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley .
he is certainly a good brother ,  said elizabeth ,  as she walked towards one of the windows .
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight ,  when she should enter the room .
and this is always the way with him ,  she added .
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment .
there is nothing he would not do for her the picturegallery ,  and two or three of the principal bedrooms ,  were all that remained to be shown .
in the former were many good paintings ;  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ;  and from such as had been already visible below ,  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys ,  in crayons ,  whose subjects were usually more interesting ,  and also more intelligible .
in the gallery there were many family portraits ,  but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
at last it arrested her — and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr. darcy ,  with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her .
she stood several minutes before the picture ,  in earnest contemplation ,  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
mrs. reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime .
there was certainly at this moment ,  in elizabeths mind ,  a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance .
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?
as a brother ,  a landlord ,  a master ,  she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship — how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow — how much of good or evil must be done by him !
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character ,  and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented ,  and fixed his eyes upon herself ,  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ;  she remembered its warmth ,  and softened its impropriety of expression .
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen ,  they returned downstairs ,  and ,  taking leave of the housekeeper ,  were consigned over to the gardener ,  who met them at the halldoor .
as they walked across the hall towards the river ,  elizabeth turned back to look again ;  her uncle and aunt stopped also ,  and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building ,  the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road ,  which led behind it to the stables .
they were within twenty yards of each other ,  and so abrupt was his appearance ,  that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
their eyes instantly met ,  and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush .
he absolutely started ,  and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise ;  but shortly recovering himself ,  advanced towards the party ,  and spoke to elizabeth ,  if not in terms of perfect composure ,  at least of perfect civility .
she had instinctively turned away ;  but stopping on his approach ,  received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
had his first appearance ,  or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining ,  been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy ,  the gardeners expression of surprise ,  on beholding his master ,  must immediately have told it .
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece ,  who ,  astonished and confused ,  scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face ,  and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .
amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted ,  every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ;  and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind ,  the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life .
nor did he seem much more at ease ;  when he spoke ,  his accent had none of its usual sedateness ;  and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn ,  and of her having stayed in derbyshire ,  so often ,  and in so hurried a way ,  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .
at length every idea seemed to fail him ;  and ,  after standing a few moments without saying a word ,  he suddenly recollected himself ,  and took leave .
the others then joined her ,  and expressed admiration of his figure ;  but elizabeth heard not a word ,  and wholly engrossed by her own feelings ,  followed them in silence .
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
her coming there was the most unfortunate ,  the most illjudged thing in the world !
how strange it must appear to him !
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !
oh !
why did she come ?
or ,  why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
had they been only ten minutes sooner ,  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination ;  for it was plain that he was that moment arrived — that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
and his behaviour ,  so strikingly altered — what could it mean ?
that he should even speak to her was amazing — but to speak with such civility ,  to inquire after her family !
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified ,  never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park ,  when he put his letter into her hand !
she knew not what to think ,  or how to account for it .
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water ,  and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground ,  or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ;  but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ;  and ,  though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt ,  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out ,  she distinguished no part of the scene .
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house ,  whichever it might be ,  where mr. darcy then was .
she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind — in what manner he thought of her ,  and whether ,  in defiance of everything ,  she was still dear to him .
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ;  yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease .
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell ,  but he certainly had not seen her with composure .
at length ,  however ,  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her ,  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .
they entered the woods ,  and bidding adieu to the river for a while ,  ascended some of the higher grounds ;  when ,  in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander ,  were many charming views of the valley ,  the opposite hills ,  with the long range of woods overspreading many ,  and occasionally part of the stream .
mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park ,  but feared it might be beyond a walk .
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round .
it settled the matter ;  and they pursued the accustomed circuit ;  which brought them again ,  after some time ,  in a descent among hanging woods ,  to the edge of the water ,  and one of its narrowest parts .
they crossed it by a simple bridge ,  in character with the general air of the scene ;  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ;  and the valley ,  here contracted into a glen ,  allowed room only for the stream ,  and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it .
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ;  but when they had crossed the bridge ,  and perceived their distance from the house ,  mrs. gardiner ,  who was not a great walker ,  could go no farther ,  and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .
her niece was ,  therefore ,  obliged to submit ,  and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river ,  in the nearest direction ;  but their progress was slow ,  for mr. gardiner ,  though seldom able to indulge the taste ,  was very fond of fishing ,  and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water ,  and talking to the man about them ,  that he advanced but little .
whilst wandering on in this slow manner ,  they were again surprised ,  and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first ,  by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them ,  and at no great distance .
the walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side ,  allowed them to see him before they met .
elizabeth ,  however astonished ,  was at least more prepared for an interview than before ,  and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness ,  if he really intended to meet them .
for a few moments ,  indeed ,  she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ;  the turning past ,  he was immediately before them .
with a glance ,  she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility ;  and ,  to imitate his politeness ,  she began ,  as they met ,  to admire the beauty of the place ;  but she had not got beyond the words delightful ,  and charming ,  when some unlucky recollections obtruded ,  and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed .
her colour changed ,  and she said no more .
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ;  and on her pausing ,  he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ;  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself .
what will be his surprise ,  thought she ,  when he knows who they are ?
he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction ,  however ,  was immediately made ;  and as she named their relationship to herself ,  she stole a sly look at him ,  to see how he bore it ,  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .
that he was surprised by the connection was evident ;  he sustained it ,  however ,  with fortitude ,  and so far from going away ,  turned back with them ,  and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .
elizabeth could not but be pleased ,  could not but triumph .
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them ,  and gloried in every expression ,  every sentence of her uncle ,  which marked his intelligence ,  his taste ,  or his good manners .
the conversation soon turned upon fishing ;  and she heard mr. darcy invite him ,  with the greatest civility ,  to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood ,  offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle ,  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .
mrs. gardiner ,  who was walking arminarm with elizabeth ,  gave her a look expressive of wonder .
elizabeth said nothing ,  but it gratified her exceedingly ;  the compliment must be all for herself .
her astonishment ,  however ,  was extreme ,  and continually was she repeating ,  why is he so altered ?
from what can it proceed ?
it cannot be for me — it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way ,  the two ladies in front ,  the two gentlemen behind ,  on resuming their places ,  after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant ,  there chanced to be a little alteration .
it originated in mrs. gardiner ,  who ,  fatigued by the exercise of the morning ,  found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support ,  and consequently preferred her husbands .
mr. darcy took her place by her niece ,  and they walked on together .
after a short silence ,  the lady first spoke .
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place ,  and accordingly began by observing ,  that his arrival had been very unexpected — for your housekeeper ,  she added ,  informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow ;  and indeed ,  before we left bakewell ,  we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all ,  and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .
they will join me early tomorrow ,  he continued ,  and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you — mr .
bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them ;  and ,  if she might judge by his complexion ,  his mind was not very differently engaged .
there is also one other person in the party ,  he continued after a pause ,  who more particularly wishes to be known to you .
will you allow me ,  or do i ask too much ,  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed ;  it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother ,  and ,  without looking farther ,  it was satisfactory ;  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .
they now walked on in silence ,  each of them deep in thought .
elizabeth was not comfortable ;  that was impossible ;  but she was flattered and pleased .
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind .
they soon outstripped the others ,  and when they had reached the carriage ,  mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .
he then asked her to walk into the house — but she declared herself not tired ,  and they stood together on the lawn .
at such a time much might have been said ,  and silence was very awkward .
she wanted to talk ,  but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject .
at last she recollected that she had been travelling ,  and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
yet time and her aunt moved slowly — and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the ttette was over .
on mr. and mrs. gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ;  but this was declined ,  and they parted on each side with utmost politeness .
mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage ;  and when it drove off ,  elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ;  and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected .
he is perfectly well behaved ,  polite ,  and unassuming ,  said her uncle .
there is something a little stately in him ,  to be sure ,  replied her aunt ,  but it is confined to his air ,  and is not unbecoming .
i can now say with the housekeeper ,  that though some people may call him proud ,  i have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .
it was more than civil ;  it was really attentive ;  and there was no necessity for such attention .
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure ,  lizzy ,  said her aunt ,  he is not so handsome as wickham ;  or ,  rather ,  he has not wickhams countenance ,  for his features are perfectly good .
but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ;  said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before ,  and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities ,  replied her uncle .
your great men often are ;  and therefore i shall not take him at his word ,  as he might change his mind another day ,  and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character ,  but said nothing .
from what we have seen of him ,  continued mrs. gardiner ,  i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham .
he has not an illnatured look .
on the contrary ,  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .
but ,  to be sure ,  the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character !
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .
but he is a liberal master ,  i suppose ,  and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ;  and therefore gave them to understand ,  in as guarded a manner as she could ,  that by what she had heard from his relations in kent ,  his actions were capable of a very different construction ;  and that his character was by no means so faulty ,  nor wickhams so amiable ,  as they had been considered in hertfordshire .
in confirmation of this ,  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected ,  without actually naming her authority ,  but stating it to be such as might be relied on .
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ;  but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures ,  every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ;  and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else .
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance ,  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ;  and she could do nothing but think ,  and think with wonder ,  of mr. darcys civility ,  and ,  above all ,  of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley ;  and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .
but her conclusion was false ;  for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton ,  these visitors came .
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends ,  and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family ,  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window ,  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street .
elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery ,  guessed what it meant ,  and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ;  and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke ,  joined to the circumstance itself ,  and many of the circumstances of the preceding day ,  opened to them a new idea on the business .
nothing had ever suggested it before ,  but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece .
while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads ,  the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing .
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ;  but amongst other causes of disquiet ,  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ;  and ,  more than commonly anxious to please ,  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
she retreated from the window ,  fearful of being seen ;  and as she walked up and down the room ,  endeavouring to compose herself ,  saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse .
miss darcy and her brother appeared ,  and this formidable introduction took place .
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .
since her being at lambton ,  she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ;  but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy .
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .
miss darcy was tall ,  and on a larger scale than elizabeth ;  and ,  though little more than sixteen ,  her figure was formed ,  and her appearance womanly and graceful .
she was less handsome than her brother ;  but there was sense and good humour in her face ,  and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .
elizabeth ,  who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been ,  was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .
they had not long been together before mr. darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ;  and she had barely time to express her satisfaction ,  and prepare for such a visitor ,  when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs ,  and in a moment he entered the room .
all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away ;  but had she still felt any ,  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again .
he inquired in a friendly ,  though general way ,  after her family ,  and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done .
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .
they had long wished to see him .
the whole party before them ,  indeed ,  excited a lively attention .
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry ;  and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt ;  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .
elizabeth ,  on her side ,  had much to do .
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors ;  she wanted to compose her own ,  and to make herself agreeable to all ;  and in the latter object ,  where she feared most to fail ,  she was most sure of success ,  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .
bingley was ready ,  georgiana was eager ,  and darcy determined ,  to be pleased .
in seeing bingley ,  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ;  and ,  oh !
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner .
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions ,  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that ,  as he looked at her ,  he was trying to trace a resemblance .
but ,  though this might be imaginary ,  she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy ,  who had been set up as a rival to jane .
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .
on this point she was soon satisfied ;  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted ,  which ,  in her anxious interpretation ,  denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness ,  and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her ,  had he dared .
he observed to her ,  at a moment when the others were talking together ,  and in a tone which had something of real regret ,  that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ;  and ,  before she could reply ,  he added ,  it is above eight months .
we have not met since the th of november ,  when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ;  and he afterwards took occasion to ask her ,  when unattended to by any of the rest ,  whether all her sisters were at longbourn .
there was not much in the question ,  nor in the preceding remark ;  but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ;  but ,  whenever she did catch a glimpse ,  she saw an expression of general complaisance ,  and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions ,  as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove ,  had at least outlived one day .
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace — when she saw him thus civil ,  not only to herself ,  but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained ,  and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage — the difference ,  the change was so great ,  and struck so forcibly on her mind ,  that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .
never ,  even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield ,  or his dignified relations at rosings ,  had she seen him so desirous to please ,  so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve ,  as now ,  when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours ,  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .
their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour ;  and when they arose to depart ,  mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner ,  and miss bennet ,  to dinner at pemberley ,  before they left the country .
miss darcy ,  though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations ,  readily obeyed .
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece ,  desirous of knowing how she ,  whom the invitation most concerned ,  felt disposed as to its acceptance ,  but elizabeth had turned away her head .
presuming however ,  that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal ,  and seeing in her husband ,  who was fond of society ,  a perfect willingness to accept it ,  she ventured to engage for her attendance ,  and the day after the next was fixed on .
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again ,  having still a great deal to say to her ,  and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .
elizabeth ,  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister ,  was pleased ,  and on this account ,  as well as some others ,  found herself ,  when their visitors left them ,  capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction ,  though while it was passing ,  the enjoyment of it had been little .
eager to be alone ,  and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt ,  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley ,  and then hurried away to dress .
but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiners curiosity ;  it was not their wish to force her communication .
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ;  it was evident that he was very much in love with her .
they saw much to interest ,  but nothing to justify inquiry .
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ;  and ,  as far as their acquaintance reached ,  there was no fault to find .
they could not be untouched by his politeness ;  and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report ,  without any reference to any other account ,  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy .
there was now an interest ,  however ,  in believing the housekeeper ;  and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old ,  and whose own manners indicated respectability ,  was not to be hastily rejected .
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight .
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ;  pride he probably had ,  and if not ,  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit .
it was acknowledged ,  however ,  that he was a liberal man ,  and did much good among the poor .
with respect to wickham ,  the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ;  for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood ,  it was yet a wellknown fact that ,  on his quitting derbyshire ,  he had left many debts behind him ,  which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .
as for elizabeth ,  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ;  and the evening ,  though as it passed it seemed long ,  was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ;  and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out .
she certainly did not hate him .
no ;  hatred had vanished long ago ,  and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him ,  that could be so called .
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities ,  though at first unwillingly admitted ,  had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling ;  and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature ,  by the testimony so highly in his favour ,  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light ,  which yesterday had produced .
but above all ,  above respect and esteem ,  there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked .
it was gratitude ;  gratitude ,  not merely for having once loved her ,  but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him ,  and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .
he who ,  she had been persuaded ,  would avoid her as his greatest enemy ,  seemed ,  on this accidental meeting ,  most eager to preserve the acquaintance ,  and without any indelicate display of regard ,  or any peculiarity of manner ,  where their two selves only were concerned ,  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends ,  and bent on making her known to his sister .
such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude — for to love ,  ardent love ,  it must be attributed ;  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged ,  as by no means unpleasing ,  though it could not be exactly defined .
she respected ,  she esteemed ,  she was grateful to him ,  she felt a real interest in his welfare ;  and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself ,  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power ,  which her fancy told her she still possessed ,  of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses .
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece ,  that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley ,  for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ,  ought to be imitated ,  though it could not be equalled ,  by some exertion of politeness on their side ;  and ,  consequently ,  that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .
they were ,  therefore ,  to go .
elizabeth was pleased ;  though when she asked herself the reason ,  she had very little to say in reply .
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before ,  and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon .
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy ,  she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her ,  and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed .
on reaching the house ,  they were shown through the hall into the saloon ,  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .
its windows opening to the ground ,  admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house ,  and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .
in this house they were received by miss darcy ,  who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley ,  and the lady with whom she lived in london .
georgianas reception of them was very civil ,  but attended with all the embarrassment which ,  though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong ,  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved .
mrs. gardiner and her niece ,  however ,  did her justice ,  and pitied her .
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey ;  and ,  on their being seated ,  a pause ,  awkward as such pauses must always be ,  succeeded for a few moments .
it was first broken by mrs. annesley ,  a genteel ,  agreeablelooking woman ,  whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others ;  and between her and mrs. gardiner ,  with occasional help from elizabeth ,  the conversation was carried on .
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ;  and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard .
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley ,  and that she could not speak a word ,  especially to miss darcy ,  without calling her attention .
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter ,  had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ;  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
her own thoughts were employing her .
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
she wished ,  she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ;  and whether she wished or feared it most ,  she could scarcely determine .
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice ,  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family .
she answered with equal indifference and brevity ,  and the other said no more .
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat ,  cake ,  and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ;  but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given ,  to remind her of her post .
there was now employment for the whole party — for though they could not all talk ,  they could all eat ;  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes ,  nectarines ,  and peaches soon collected them round the table .
while thus engaged ,  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy ,  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ;  and then ,  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate ,  she began to regret that he came .
he had been some time with mr. gardiner ,  who ,  with two or three other gentlemen from the house ,  was engaged by the river ,  and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ;  a resolution the more necessary to be made ,  but perhaps not the more easily kept ,  because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them ,  and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys ,  in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ;  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate ,  and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .
miss darcy ,  on her brothers entrance ,  exerted herself much more to talk ,  and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted ,  and forwarded as much as possible ,  every attempt at conversation on either side .
miss bingley saw all this likewise ;  and ,  in the imprudence of anger ,  took the first opportunity of saying ,  with sneering civility :  pray ,  miss eliza ,  are not the  —  — shire militia removed from meryton ?
they must be a great loss to your family in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name ;  but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ;  and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress ;  but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack ,  she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone .
while she spoke ,  an involuntary glance showed her darcy ,  with a heightened complexion ,  earnestly looking at her ,  and his sister overcome with confusion ,  and unable to lift up her eyes .
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend ,  she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ;  but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial ,  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion ,  and ,  perhaps ,  to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement .
to no creature had it been revealed ,  where secrecy was possible ,  except to elizabeth ;  and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it ,  from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him ,  of their becoming hereafter her own .
he had certainly formed such a plan ,  and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet ,  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .
elizabeths collected behaviour ,  however ,  soon quieted his emotion ;  and as miss bingley ,  vexed and disappointed ,  dared not approach nearer to wickham ,  georgiana also recovered in time ,  though not enough to be able to speak any more .
her brother ,  whose eye she feared to meet ,  scarcely recollected her interest in the affair ,  and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ;  and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person ,  behaviour ,  and dress .
but georgiana would not join her .
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour ;  his judgement could not err .
and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .
when darcy returned to the saloon ,  miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .
how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning ,  mr. darcy ,  she cried ;  i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .
she is grown so brown and coarse !
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address ,  he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,  no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
for my own part ,  she rejoined ,  i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .
her face is too thin ;  her complexion has no brilliancy ;  and her features are not at all handsome .
her nose wants character — there is nothing marked in its lines .
her teeth are tolerable ,  but not out of the common way ;  and as for her eyes ,  which have sometimes been called so fine ,  i could never see anything extraordinary in them .
they have a sharp ,  shrewish look ,  which i do not like at all ;  and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion ,  which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth ,  this was not the best method of recommending herself ;  but angry people are not always wise ;  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled ,  she had all the success she expected .
he was resolutely silent ,  however ,  and ,  from a determination of making him speak ,  she continued :  i remember ,  when we first knew her in hertfordshire ,  how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ;  and i particularly recollect your saying one night ,  after they had been dining at netherfield ,  she a beauty — i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you ,  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes ,  replied darcy ,  who could contain himself no longer ,  but that was only when i first saw her ,  for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away ,  and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit ,  as they returned ,  except what had particularly interested them both .
the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed ,  except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
they talked of his sister ,  his friends ,  his house ,  his fruit — of everything but himself ;  yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him ,  and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject .
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton ;  and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ;  but on the third her repining was over ,  and her sister justified ,  by the receipt of two letters from her at once ,  on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .
elizabeth was not surprised at it ,  as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ;  and her uncle and aunt ,  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet ,  set off by themselves .
the one missent must first be attended to ;  it had been written five days ago .
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements ,  with such news as the country afforded ;  but the latter half ,  which was dated a day later ,  and written in evident agitation ,  gave more important intelligence .
it was to this effect :  since writing the above ,  dearest lizzy ,  something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ;  but i am afraid of alarming you — be assured that we are all well .
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .
an express came at twelve last night ,  just as we were all gone to bed ,  from colonel forster ,  to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ;  to own the truth ,  with wickham !
imagine our surprise .
to kitty ,  however ,  it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
i am very ,  very sorry .
so imprudent a match on both sides !
but i am willing to hope the best ,  and that his character has been misunderstood .
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him ,  but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart .
his choice is disinterested at least ,  for he must know my father can give her nothing .
our poor mother is sadly grieved .
my father bears it better .
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him ;  we must forget it ourselves .
they were off saturday night about twelve ,  as is conjectured ,  but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .
the express was sent off directly .
my dear lizzy ,  they must have passed within ten miles of us .
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .
lydia left a few lines for his wife ,  informing her of their intention .
i must conclude ,  for i cannot be long from my poor mother .
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out ,  but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration ,  and scarcely knowing what she felt ,  elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other ,  and opening it with the utmost impatience ,  read as follows :  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .
by this time ,  my dearest sister ,  you have received my hurried letter ;  i wish this may be more intelligible ,  but though not confined for time ,  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .
dearest lizzy ,  i hardly know what i would write ,  but i have bad news for you ,  and it cannot be delayed .
imprudent as the marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be ,  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place ,  for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .
colonel forster came yesterday ,  having left brighton the day before ,  not many hours after the express .
though lydias short letter to mrs. f .
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green ,  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w .
never intended to go there ,  or to marry lydia at all ,  which was repeated to colonel f ,  who ,  instantly taking the alarm ,  set off from b .
intending to trace their route .
he did trace them easily to clapham ,  but no further ;  for on entering that place ,  they removed into a hackney coach ,  and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .
all that is known after this is ,  that they were seen to continue the london road .
i know not what to think .
after making every possible inquiry on that side london ,  colonel f .
came on into hertfordshire ,  anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes ,  and at the inns in barnet and hatfield ,  but without any success — no such people had been seen to pass through .
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn ,  and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f ,  but no one can throw any blame on them .
our distress ,  my dear lizzy ,  is very great .
my father and mother believe the worst ,  but i cannot think so ill of him .
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ;  and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections ,  which is not likely ,  can i suppose her so lost to everything ?
impossible !
i grieve to find ,  however ,  that colonel f .
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ;  he shook his head when i expressed my hopes ,  and said he feared w .
was not a man to be trusted .
my poor mother is really ill ,  and keeps her room .
could she exert herself ,  it would be better ;  but this is not to be expected .
and as to my father ,  i never in my life saw him so affected .
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ;  but as it was a matter of confidence ,  one cannot wonder .
i am truly glad ,  dearest lizzy ,  that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ;  but now ,  as the first shock is over ,  shall i own that i long for your return ?
i am not so selfish ,  however ,  as to press for it ,  if inconvenient .
adieu !
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not ;  but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible .
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well ,  that i am not afraid of requesting it ,  though i have still something more to ask of the former .
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly ,  to try to discover her .
what he means to do i am sure i know not ;  but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way ,  and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening .
in such an exigence ,  my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world ;  he will immediately comprehend what i must feel ,  and i rely upon his goodness oh !
where ,  where is my uncle cried elizabeth ,  darting from her seat as she finished the letter ,  in eagerness to follow him ,  without losing a moment of the time so precious ;  but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant ,  and mr. darcy appeared .
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start ,  and before he could recover himself to speak ,  she ,  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation ,  hastily exclaimed ,  i beg your pardon ,  but i must leave you .
i must find mr. gardiner this moment ,  on business that cannot be delayed ;  i have not an instant to lose good god !
what is the matter cried he ,  with more feeling than politeness ;  then recollecting himself ,  i will not detain you a minute ;  but let me ,  or let the servant go after mr. and mrs. gardiner .
you are not well enough ;  you cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated ,  but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .
calling back the servant ,  therefore ,  she commissioned him ,  though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible ,  to fetch his master and mistress home instantly .
on his quitting the room she sat down ,  unable to support herself ,  and looking so miserably ill ,  that it was impossible for darcy to leave her ,  or to refrain from saying ,  in a tone of gentleness and commiseration ,  let me call your maid .
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ?
a glass of wine ;  shall i get you one ?
you are very ill no ,  i thank you ,  she replied ,  endeavouring to recover herself .
there is nothing the matter with me .
i am quite well ;  i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it ,  and for a few minutes could not speak another word .
darcy ,  in wretched suspense ,  could only say something indistinctly of his concern ,  and observe her in compassionate silence .
at length she spoke again .
i have just had a letter from jane ,  with such dreadful news .
it cannot be concealed from anyone .
my younger sister has left all her friends — has eloped ;  has thrown herself into the power of — of mr. wickham .
they are gone off together from brighton .
you know him too well to doubt the rest .
she has no money ,  no connections ,  nothing that can tempt him to — she is lost for ever darcy was fixed in astonishment .
when i consider ,  she added in a yet more agitated voice ,  that i might have prevented it !
i who knew what he was .
had i but explained some part of it only — some part of what i learnt ,  to my own family !
had his character been known ,  this could not have happened .
but it is all — all too late now i am grieved indeed ,  cried darcy ;  grieved — shocked .
but is it certain — absolutely certain oh ,  yes !
they left brighton together on sunday night ,  and were traced almost to london ,  but not beyond ;  they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done ,  what has been attempted ,  to recover her my father is gone to london ,  and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance ;  and we shall be off ,  i hope ,  in halfanhour .
but nothing can be done — i know very well that nothing can be done .
how is such a man to be worked on ?
how are they even to be discovered ?
i have not the smallest hope .
it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence .
when my eyes were opened to his real character — oh !
had i known what i ought ,  what i dared to do !
but i knew not — i was afraid of doing too much .
wretched ,  wretched mistake darcy made no answer .
he seemed scarcely to hear her ,  and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ,  his brow contracted ,  his air gloomy .
elizabeth soon observed ,  and instantly understood it .
her power was sinking ;  everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness ,  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .
she could neither wonder nor condemn ,  but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom ,  afforded no palliation of her distress .
it was ,  on the contrary ,  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ;  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him ,  as now ,  when all love must be vain .
but self ,  though it would intrude ,  could not engross her .
lydia — the humiliation ,  the misery she was bringing on them all ,  soon swallowed up every private care ;  and covering her face with her handkerchief ,  elizabeth was soon lost to everything else ;  and ,  after a pause of several minutes ,  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion ,  who ,  in a manner which ,  though it spoke compassion ,  spoke likewise restraint ,  said ,  i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence ,  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay ,  but real ,  though unavailing concern .
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress !
but i will not torment you with vain wishes ,  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .
this unfortunate affair will ,  i fear ,  prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh ,  yes .
be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy .
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible ,  i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy ;  again expressed his sorrow for her distress ,  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope ,  and leaving his compliments for her relations ,  with only one serious ,  parting look ,  went away .
as he quitted the room ,  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ;  and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance ,  so full of contradictions and varieties ,  sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance ,  and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection ,  elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
but if otherwise — if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural ,  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object ,  and even before two words have been exchanged ,  nothing can be said in her defence ,  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham ,  and that its ill success might ,  perhaps ,  authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .
be that as it may ,  she saw him go with regret ;  and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce ,  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .
never ,  since reading janes second letter ,  had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her .
no one but jane ,  she thought ,  could flatter herself with such an expectation .
surprise was the least of her feelings on this development .
while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind ,  she was all surprise — all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money ;  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible .
but now it was all too natural .
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms ;  and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage ,  she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .
she had never perceived ,  while the regiment was in hertfordshire ,  that lydia had any partiality for him ;  but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody .
sometimes one officer ,  sometimes another ,  had been her favourite ,  as their attentions raised them in her opinion .
her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object .
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl — oh !
how acutely did she now feel it !
she was wild to be at home — to hear ,  to see ,  to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her ,  in a family so deranged ,  a father absent ,  a mother incapable of exertion ,  and requiring constant attendance ;  and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia ,  her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance ,  and till he entered the room her impatience was severe .
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm ,  supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill ;  but satisfying them instantly on that head ,  she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons ,  reading the two letters aloud ,  and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy —  though lydia had never been a favourite with them ,  mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted .
not lydia only ,  but all were concerned in it ;  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror ,  mr. gardiner promised every assistance in his power .
elizabeth ,  though expecting no less ,  thanked him with tears of gratitude ;  and all three being actuated by one spirit ,  everything relating to their journey was speedily settled .
they were to be off as soon as possible .
but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs. gardiner .
john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us ;  was it so yes ;  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .
that is all settled what is all settled repeated the other ,  as she ran into her room to prepare .
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ?
oh ,  that i knew how it was but wishes were vain ,  or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle ,  she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ;  but she had her share of business as well as her aunt ,  and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton ,  with false excuses for their sudden departure .
an hour ,  however ,  saw the whole completed ;  and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn ,  nothing remained to be done but to go ;  and elizabeth ,  after all the misery of the morning ,  found herself ,  in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed ,  seated in the carriage ,  and on the road to longbourn .
i have been thinking it over again ,  elizabeth ,  said her uncle ,  as they drove from the town ;  and really ,  upon serious consideration ,  i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter .
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless ,  and who was actually staying in his colonels family ,  that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment ,  after such an affront to colonel forster ?
his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth ,  brightening up for a moment .
upon my word ,  said mrs. gardiner ,  i begin to be of your uncles opinion .
it is really too great a violation of decency ,  honour ,  and interest ,  for him to be guilty of .
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .
can you yourself ,  lizzy ,  so wholly give him up ,  as to believe him capable of it not ,  perhaps ,  of neglecting his own interest ;  but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .
if ,  indeed ,  it should be so !
but i dare not hope it .
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place ,  replied mr. gardiner ,  there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh !
but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption !
and ,  besides ,  no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well ,  then — supposing them to be in london .
they may be there ,  though for the purpose of concealment ,  for no more exceptional purpose .
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ;  and it might strike them that they could be more economically ,  though less expeditiously ,  married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy ?
why any fear of detection ?
why must their marriage be private ?
oh ,  no ,  no — this is not likely .
his most particular friend ,  you see by janes account ,  was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
he cannot afford it .
and what claims has lydia — what attraction has she beyond youth ,  health ,  and good humour that could make him ,  for her sake ,  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?
as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her ,  i am not able to judge ;  for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .
but as to your other objection ,  i am afraid it will hardly hold good .
lydia has no brothers to step forward ;  and he might imagine ,  from my fathers behaviour ,  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family ,  that he would do as little ,  and think as little about it ,  as any father could do ,  in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage it does seem ,  and it is most shocking indeed ,  replied elizabeth ,  with tears in her eyes ,  that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .
but ,  really ,  i know not what to say .
perhaps i am not doing her justice .
but she is very young ;  she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ;  and for the last halfyear ,  nay ,  for a twelvemonth — she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner ,  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .
since the  —  — shire were first quartered in meryton ,  nothing but love ,  flirtation ,  and officers have been in her head .
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject ,  to give greater — what shall i call it ?
susceptibility to her feelings ;  which are naturally lively enough .
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane ,  said her aunt ,  does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill ?
and who is there ,  whatever might be their former conduct ,  that she would think capable of such an attempt ,  till it were proved against them ?
but jane knows ,  as well as i do ,  what wickham really is .
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ;  that he has neither integrity nor honour ;  that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs. gardiner ,  whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .
i do indeed ,  replied elizabeth ,  colouring .
i told you ,  the other day ,  of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ;  and you yourself ,  when last at longbourn ,  heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty — which it is not worth while to relate ;  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud ,  reserved ,  disagreeable girl .
yet he knew to the contrary himself .
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this ?
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh ,  yes — that ,  that is the worst of all .
till i was in kent ,  and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam ,  i was ignorant of the truth myself .
and when i returned home ,  the  —  — shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time .
as that was the case ,  neither jane ,  to whom i related the whole ,  nor i ,  thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ;  for of what use could it apparently be to any one ,  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ?
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster ,  the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
that such a consequence as this could ensue ,  you may easily believe ,  was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton ,  therefore ,  you had no reason ,  i suppose ,  to believe them fond of each other not the slightest .
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ;  and had anything of the kind been perceptible ,  you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away .
when first he entered the corps ,  she was ready enough to admire him ;  but so we all were .
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ;  but he never distinguished her by any particular attention ;  and ,  consequently ,  after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration ,  her fancy for him gave way ,  and others of the regiment ,  who treated her with more distinction ,  again became her favourites it may be easily believed ,  that however little of novelty could be added to their fears ,  hopes ,  and conjectures ,  on this interesting subject ,  by its repeated discussion ,  no other could detain them from it long ,  during the whole of the journey .
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent .
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish ,  selfreproach ,  she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ,  and ,  sleeping one night on the road ,  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day .
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
the little gardiners ,  attracted by the sight of a chaise ,  were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock ;  and ,  when the carriage drove up to the door ,  the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces ,  and displayed itself over their whole bodies ,  in a variety of capers and frisks ,  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .
elizabeth jumped out ;  and ,  after giving each of them a hasty kiss ,  hurried into the vestibule ,  where jane ,  who came running down from her mothers apartment ,  immediately met her .
elizabeth ,  as she affectionately embraced her ,  whilst tears filled the eyes of both ,  lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives .
not yet ,  replied jane .
but now that my dear uncle is come ,  i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes ,  he went on tuesday ,  as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only twice .
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety ,  and to give me his directions ,  which i particularly begged him to do .
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my mother — how is she ?
how are you all my mother is tolerably well ,  i trust ;  though her spirits are greatly shaken .
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .
she does not yet leave her dressingroom .
mary and kitty ,  thank heaven ,  are quite well but you — how are you cried elizabeth .
you look pale .
how much you must have gone through her sister ,  however ,  assured her of her being perfectly well ;  and their conversation ,  which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children ,  was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party .
jane ran to her uncle and aunt ,  and welcomed and thanked them both ,  with alternate smiles and tears .
when they were all in the drawingroom ,  the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others ,  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .
the sanguine hope of good ,  however ,  which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her ;  she still expected that it would all end well ,  and that every morning would bring some letter ,  either from lydia or her father ,  to explain their proceedings ,  and ,  perhaps ,  announce their marriage .
mrs. bennet ,  to whose apartment they all repaired ,  after a few minutes conversation together ,  received them exactly as might be expected ;  with tears and lamentations of regret ,  invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham ,  and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage ;  blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing .
if i had been able ,  said she ,  to carry my point in going to brighton ,  with all my family ,  this would not have happened ;  but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side ,  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after .
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ;  but i was overruled ,  as i always am .
poor dear child !
and now heres mr. bennet gone away ,  and i know he will fight wickham ,  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed ,  and what is to become of us all ?
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave ,  and if you are not kind to us ,  brother ,  i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ;  and mr. gardiner ,  after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family ,  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day ,  and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .
do not give way to useless alarm ,  added he ;  though it is right to be prepared for the worst ,  there is no occasion to look on it as certain .
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .
in a few days more we may gain some news of them ;  and till we know that they are not married ,  and have no design of marrying ,  do not let us give the matter over as lost .
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother ,  and make him come home with me to gracechurch street ;  and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh !
my dear brother ,  replied mrs. bennet ,  that is exactly what i could most wish for .
and now do ,  when you get to town ,  find them out ,  wherever they may be ;  and if they are not married already ,  make them marry .
and as for wedding clothes ,  do not let them wait for that ,  but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them ,  after they are married .
and ,  above all ,  keep mr. bennet from fighting .
tell him what a dreadful state i am in ,  that i am frighted out of my wits — and have such tremblings ,  such flutterings ,  all over me — such spasms in my side and pains in my head ,  and such beatings at heart ,  that i can get no rest by night nor by day .
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me ,  for she does not know which are the best warehouses .
oh ,  brother ,  how kind you are !
i know you will contrive it all but mr. gardiner ,  though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause ,  could not avoid recommending moderation to her ,  as well in her hopes as her fear ;  and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table ,  they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper ,  who attended in the absence of her daughters .
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family ,  they did not attempt to oppose it ,  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants ,  while they waited at table ,  and judged it better that one only of the household ,  and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty ,  who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
one came from her books ,  and the other from her toilette .
the faces of both ,  however ,  were tolerably calm ;  and no change was visible in either ,  except that the loss of her favourite sister ,  or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business ,  had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty .
as for mary ,  she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth ,  with a countenance of grave reflection ,  soon after they were seated at table :  this is a most unfortunate affair ,  and will probably be much talked of .
but we must stem the tide of malice ,  and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then ,  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying ,  she added ,  unhappy as the event must be for lydia ,  we may draw from it this useful lesson :  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ;  that one false step involves her in endless ruin ;  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ;  and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement ,  but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
mary ,  however ,  continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .
in the afternoon ,  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves ;  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries ,  which jane was equally eager to satisfy .
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event ,  which elizabeth considered as all but certain ,  and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ,  the former continued the subject ,  by saying ,  but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard .
give me further particulars .
what did colonel forster say ?
had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ?
they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality ,  especially on lydias side ,  but nothing to give him any alarm .
i am so grieved for him !
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .
he was coming to us ,  in order to assure us of his concern ,  before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland :  when that apprehension first got abroad ,  it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?
did he know of their intending to go off ?
had colonel forster seen denny himself yes ;  but ,  when questioned by him ,  denny denied knowing anything of their plans ,  and would not give his real opinion about it .
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying — and from that ,  i am inclined to hope ,  he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself ,  not one of you entertained a doubt ,  i suppose ,  of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ?
i felt a little uneasy — a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage ,  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .
my father and mother knew nothing of that ;  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
kitty then owned ,  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us ,  that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step .
she had known ,  it seems ,  of their being in love with each other ,  many weeks but not before they went to brighton no ,  i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself ?
does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .
and since this sad affair has taken place ,  it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt ;  but i hope this may be false oh ,  jane ,  had we been less secret ,  had we told what we knew of him ,  this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better ,  replied her sister .
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were ,  seemed unjustifiable .
we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook ,  and gave it to elizabeth .
these were the contents :  my dear harriet ,  you will laugh when you know where i am gone ,  and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning ,  as soon as i am missed .
i am going to gretna green ,  and if you cannot guess with who ,  i shall think you a simpleton ,  for there is but one man in the world i love ,  and he is an angel .
i should never be happy without him ,  so think it no harm to be off .
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going ,  if you do not like it ,  for it will make the surprise the greater ,  when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be !
i can hardly write for laughing .
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement ,  and dancing with him tonight .
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all ;  and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet ,  with great pleasure .
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ;  but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up .
goodbye .
give my love to colonel forster .
i hope you will drink to our good journey .
your affectionate friend ,  lydia bennet oh !
thoughtless ,  thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it .
what a letter is this ,  to be written at such a moment !
but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey .
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to ,  it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .
my poor father !
how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked .
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .
my mother was taken ill immediately ,  and the whole house in such confusion oh !
jane ,  cried elizabeth ,  was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know .
i hope there was .
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult .
my mother was in hysterics ,  and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power ,  i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you .
you do not look well .
oh that i had been with you !
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind ,  and would have shared in every fatigue ,  i am sure ;  but i did not think it right for either of them .
kitty is slight and delicate ;  and mary studies so much ,  that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday ,  after my father went away ;  and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .
she was of great use and comfort to us all .
and lady lucas has been very kind ;  she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us ,  and offered her services ,  or any of her daughters ,  if they should be of use to us she had better have stayed at home ,  cried elizabeth ;  perhaps she meant well ,  but ,  under such a misfortune as this ,  one cannot see too little of ones neighbours .
assistance is impossible ;  condolence insufferable .
let them triumph over us at a distance ,  and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue ,  while in town ,  for the recovery of his daughter .
he meant i believe ,  replied jane ,  to go to epsom ,  the place where they last changed horses ,  see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them .
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .
it had come with a fare from london ;  and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham .
if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare ,  he determined to make inquiries there ,  and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed ;  but he was in such a hurry to be gone ,  and his spirits so greatly discomposed ,  that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning ,  but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .
his family knew him to be ,  on all common occasions ,  a most negligent and dilatory correspondent ;  but at such a time they had hoped for exertion .
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send ;  but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .
when he was gone ,  they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on ,  and their uncle promised ,  at parting ,  to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn ,  as soon as he could ,  to the great consolation of his sister ,  who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel .
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer ,  as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet ,  and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom .
their other aunt also visited them frequently ,  and always ,  as she said ,  with the design of cheering and heartening them up — though ,  as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity ,  she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who ,  but three months before ,  had been almost an angel of light .
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place ,  and his intrigues ,  all honoured with the title of seduction ,  had been extended into every tradesmans family .
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ;  and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .
elizabeth ,  though she did not credit above half of what was said ,  believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain ;  and even jane ,  who believed still less of it ,  became almost hopeless ,  more especially as the time was now come when ,  if they had gone to scotland ,  which she had never before entirely despaired of ,  they must in all probability have gained some news of them .
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ;  on tuesday his wife received a letter from him ;  it told them that ,  on his arrival ,  he had immediately found out his brother ,  and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street ;  that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham ,  before his arrival ,  but without gaining any satisfactory information ;  and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town ,  as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them ,  on their first coming to london ,  before they procured lodgings .
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure ,  but as his brother was eager in it ,  he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
he added that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon .
there was also a postscript to this effect :  i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out ,  if possible ,  from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment ,  whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself .
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that ,  it might be of essential consequence .
at present we have nothing to guide us .
colonel forster will ,  i dare say ,  do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head .
but ,  on second thoughts ,  perhaps ,  lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living ,  better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded ;  but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved .
she had never heard of his having had any relations ,  except a father and mother ,  both of whom had been dead many years .
it was possible ,  however ,  that some of his companions in the  —  — shire might be able to give more information ;  and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it ,  the application was a something to look forward to .
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ;  but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .
the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience .
through letters ,  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated ,  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner ,  a letter arrived for their father ,  from a different quarter ,  from mr. collins ;  which ,  as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence ,  she accordingly read ;  and elizabeth ,  who knew what curiosities his letters always were ,  looked over her ,  and read it likewise .
it was as follows :  my dear sir ,  i feel myself called upon ,  by our relationship ,  and my situation in life ,  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under ,  of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .
be assured ,  my dear sir ,  that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family ,  in your present distress ,  which must be of the bitterest kind ,  because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune — or that may comfort you ,  under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind .
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .
and it is the more to be lamented ,  because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me ,  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ;  though ,  at the same time ,  for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet ,  i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad ,  or she could not be guilty of such an enormity ,  at so early an age .
howsoever that may be ,  you are grievously to be pitied ;  in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins ,  but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter ,  to whom i have related the affair .
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ;  for who ,  as lady catherine herself condescendingly says ,  will connect themselves with such a family ?
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect ,  with augmented satisfaction ,  on a certain event of last november ;  for had it been otherwise ,  i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .
let me then advise you ,  dear sir ,  to console yourself as much as possible ,  to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever ,  and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
i am ,  dear sir ,  etc ,  etc mr. gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster ;  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection ,  and it was certain that he had no near one living .
his former acquaintances had been numerous ;  but since he had been in the militia ,  it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .
there was no one ,  therefore ,  who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him .
and in the wretched state of his own finances ,  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy ,  in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations ,  for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount .
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton .
he owed a good deal in town ,  but his debts of honour were still more formidable .
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family .
jane heard them with horror .
a gamester she cried .
this is wholly unexpected .
i had not an idea of it mr. gardiner added in his letter ,  that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day ,  which was saturday .
rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours ,  he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family ,  and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .
when mrs. bennet was told of this ,  she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected ,  considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .
what ,  is he coming home ,  and without poor lydia she cried .
sure he will not leave london before he has found them .
who is to fight wickham ,  and make him marry her ,  if he comes away as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home ,  it was settled that she and the children should go to london ,  at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .
the coach ,  therefore ,  took them the first stage of their journey ,  and brought its master back to longbourn .
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world .
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ;  and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs. gardiner had formed ,  of their being followed by a letter from him ,  had ended in nothing .
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley .
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ;  nothing ,  therefore ,  could be fairly conjectured from that ,  though elizabeth ,  who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings ,  was perfectly aware that ,  had she known nothing of darcy ,  she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better .
it would have spared her ,  she thought ,  one sleepless night out of two .
when mr. bennet arrived ,  he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ;  made no mention of the business that had taken him away ,  and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .
it was not till the afternoon ,  when he had joined them at tea ,  that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ;  and then ,  on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured ,  he replied ,  say nothing of that .
who should suffer but myself ?
it has been my own doing ,  and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself ,  replied elizabeth .
you may well warn me against such an evil .
human nature is so prone to fall into it !
no ,  lizzy ,  let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .
it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes ;  where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london ,  added kitty .
she is happy then ,  said her father drily ;  and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued :  lizzy ,  i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may ,  which ,  considering the event ,  shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennet ,  who came to fetch her mothers tea .
this is a parade ,  he cried ,  which does one good ;  it gives such an elegance to misfortune !
another day i will do the same ;  i will sit in my library ,  in my nightcap and powdering gown ,  and give as much trouble as i can ;  or ,  perhaps ,  i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away ,  papa ,  said kitty fretfully .
if i should ever go to brighton ,  i would behave better than lydia you go to brighton .
i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds !
no ,  kitty ,  i have at last learnt to be cautious ,  and you will feel the effects of it .
no officer is ever to enter into my house again ,  nor even to pass through the village .
balls will be absolutely prohibited ,  unless you stand up with one of your sisters .
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty ,  who took all these threats in a serious light ,  began to cry .
well ,  well ,  said he ,  do not make yourself unhappy .
if you are a good girl for the next ten years ,  i will take you to a review at the end of them two days after mr. bennets return ,  as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house ,  they saw the housekeeper coming towards them ,  and ,  concluding that she came to call them to their mother ,  went forward to meet her ;  but ,  instead of the expected summons ,  when they approached her ,  she said to miss bennet ,  i beg your pardon ,  madam ,  for interrupting you ,  but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town ,  so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean ,  hill ?
we have heard nothing from town dear madam ,  cried mrs. hill ,  in great astonishment ,  dont you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?
he has been here this halfhour ,  and master has had a letter away ran the girls ,  too eager to get in to have time for speech .
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom ;  from thence to the library ;  their father was in neither ;  and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother ,  when they were met by the butler ,  who said :  if you are looking for my master ,  maam ,  he is walking towards the little copse upon this information ,  they instantly passed through the hall once more ,  and ran across the lawn after their father ,  who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .
jane ,  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth ,  soon lagged behind ,  while her sister ,  panting for breath ,  came up with him ,  and eagerly cried out :  oh ,  papa ,  what news — what news ?
have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well ,  and what news does it bring — good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he ,  taking the letter from his pocket .
but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .
jane now came up .
read it aloud ,  said their father ,  for i hardly know myself what it is about gracechurch street ,  monday ,  august  .
my dear brother ,  at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece ,  and such as ,  upon the whole ,  i hope it will give you satisfaction .
soon after you left me on saturday ,  i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .
the particulars i reserve till we meet ;  it is enough to know they are discovered .
i have seen them both —  then it is as i always hoped ,  cried jane ;  they are married elizabeth read on :  i have seen them both .
they are not married ,  nor can i find there was any intention of being so ;  but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side ,  i hope it will not be long before they are .
all that is required of you is ,  to assure to your daughter ,  by settlement ,  her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ;  and ,  moreover ,  to enter into an engagement of allowing her ,  during your life ,  one hundred pounds per annum .
these are conditions which ,  considering everything ,  i had no hesitation in complying with ,  as far as i thought myself privileged ,  for you .
i shall send this by express ,  that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .
you will easily comprehend ,  from these particulars ,  that mr. wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .
the world has been deceived in that respect ;  and i am happy to say there will be some little money ,  even when all his debts are discharged ,  to settle on my niece ,  in addition to her own fortune .
if ,  as i conclude will be the case ,  you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business ,  i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ;  therefore stay quiet at longbourn ,  and depend on my diligence and care .
send back your answer as fast as you can ,  and be careful to write explicitly .
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house ,  of which i hope you will approve .
she comes to us today .
i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on .
yours ,  etc ,  edw .
gardiner is it possible cried elizabeth ,  when she had finished .
can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving ,  then ,  as we thought him ,  said her sister .
my dear father ,  i congratulate you and have you answered the letter cried elizabeth .
no ;  but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .
oh !
my dear father ,  she cried ,  come back and write immediately .
consider how important every moment is in such a case let me write for you ,  said jane ,  if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much ,  he replied ;  but it must be done and so saying ,  he turned back with them ,  and walked towards the house .
and may i ask —  said elizabeth ;  but the terms ,  i suppose ,  must be complied with complied with !
i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they must marry !
yet he is such a man yes ,  yes ,  they must marry .
there is nothing else to be done .
but there are two things that i want very much to know ;  one is ,  how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ;  and the other ,  how am i ever to pay him money !
my uncle cried jane ,  what do you mean ,  sir i mean ,  that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life ,  and fifty after i am gone that is very true ,  said elizabeth ;  though it had not occurred to me before .
his debts to be discharged ,  and something still to remain !
oh !
it must be my uncles doings !
generous ,  good man ,  i am afraid he has distressed himself .
a small sum could not do all this no ,  said her father ;  wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .
i should be sorry to think so ill of him ,  in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds !
heaven forbid !
how is half such a sum to be repaid mr. bennet made no answer ,  and each of them ,  deep in thought ,  continued silent till they reached the house .
their father then went on to the library to write ,  and the girls walked into the breakfastroom .
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth ,  as soon as they were by themselves .
how strange this is !
and for this we are to be thankful .
that they should marry ,  small as is their chance of happiness ,  and wretched as is his character ,  we are forced to rejoice .
oh ,  lydia i comfort myself with thinking ,  replied jane ,  that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her .
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him ,  i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds ,  or anything like it ,  has been advanced .
he has children of his own ,  and may have more .
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been ,  said elizabeth ,  and how much is settled on his side on our sister ,  we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them ,  because wickham has not sixpence of his own .
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .
their taking her home ,  and affording her their personal protection and countenance ,  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .
by this time she is actually with them !
if such goodness does not make her miserable now ,  she will never deserve to be happy !
what a meeting for her ,  when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side ,  said jane :  i hope and trust they will yet be happy .
his consenting to marry her is a proof ,  i will believe ,  that he is come to a right way of thinking .
their mutual affection will steady them ;  and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly ,  and live in so rational a manner ,  as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such ,  replied elizabeth ,  as neither you ,  nor i ,  nor anybody can ever forget .
it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .
they went to the library ,  therefore ,  and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .
he was writing and ,  without raising his head ,  coolly replied :  just as you please may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever you like ,  and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable ,  and they went up stairs together .
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet :  one communication would ,  therefore ,  do for all .
after a slight preparation for good news ,  the letter was read aloud .
mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiners hope of lydias being soon married ,  her joy burst forth ,  and every following sentence added to its exuberance .
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight ,  as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation .
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity ,  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
my dear ,  dear lydia she cried .
this is delightful indeed !
she will be married !
i shall see her again !
she will be married at sixteen !
my good ,  kind brother !
i knew how it would be .
i knew he would manage everything !
how i long to see her !
and to see dear wickham too !
but the clothes ,  the wedding clothes !
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .
lizzy ,  my dear ,  run down to your father ,  and ask him how much he will give her .
stay ,  stay ,  i will go myself .
ring the bell ,  kitty ,  for hill .
i will put on my things in a moment .
my dear ,  dear lydia !
how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports ,  by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiners behaviour laid them all under .
for we must attribute this happy conclusion ,  she added ,  in a great measure to his kindness .
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money well ,  cried her mother ,  it is all very right ;  who should do it but her own uncle ?
if he had not had a family of his own ,  i and my children must have had all his money ,  you know ;  and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him ,  except a few presents .
well !
i am so happy !
in a short time i shall have a daughter married .
mrs. wickham !
how well it sounds !
and she was only sixteen last june .
my dear jane ,  i am in such a flutter ,  that i am sure i cant write ;  so i will dictate ,  and you write for me .
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ;  but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico ,  muslin ,  and cambric ,  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders ,  had not jane ,  though with some difficulty ,  persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted .
one days delay ,  she observed ,  would be of small importance ;  and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual .
other schemes ,  too ,  came into her head .
i will go to meryton ,  said she ,  as soon as i am dressed ,  and tell the good ,  good news to my sister philips .
and as i come back ,  i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .
kitty ,  run down and order the carriage .
an airing would do me a great deal of good ,  i am sure .
girls ,  can i do anything for you in meryton ?
oh !
here comes hill !
my dear hill ,  have you heard the good news ?
miss lydia is going to be married ;  and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest ,  and then ,  sick of this folly ,  took refuge in her own room ,  that she might think with freedom .
poor lydias situation must ,  at best ,  be bad enough ;  but that it was no worse ,  she had need to be thankful .
she felt it so ;  and though ,  in looking forward ,  neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister ,  in looking back to what they had feared ,  only two hours ago ,  she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .
mr. bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that ,  instead of spending his whole income ,  he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children ,  and of his wife ,  if she survived him .
he now wished it more than ever .
had he done his duty in that respect ,  lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place .
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw ,  and he was determined ,  if possible ,  to find out the extent of his assistance ,  and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .
when first mr. bennet had married ,  economy was held to be perfectly useless ,  for ,  of course ,  they were to have a son .
the son was to join in cutting off the entail ,  as soon as he should be of age ,  and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .
five daughters successively entered the world ,  but yet the son was to come ;  and mrs. bennet ,  for many years after lydias birth ,  had been certain that he would .
this event had at last been despaired of ,  but it was then too late to be saving .
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy ,  and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents .
this was one point ,  with regard to lydia ,  at least ,  which was now to be settled ,  and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother ,  though expressed most concisely ,  he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done ,  and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .
he had never before supposed that ,  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter ,  it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement .
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them ;  for ,  what with her board and pocket allowance ,  and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands ,  lydias expenses had been very little within that sum .
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side ,  too ,  was another very welcome surprise ;  for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over ,  he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
his letter was soon dispatched ;  for ,  though dilatory in undertaking business ,  he was quick in its execution .
he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ,  but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her .
the good news spread quickly through the house ,  and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .
to be sure ,  it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ;  or ,  as the happiest alternative ,  been secluded from the world ,  in some distant farmhouse .
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her ;  and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances ,  because with such an husband her misery was considered certain .
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been downstairs ;  but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table ,  and in spirits oppressively high .
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .
the marriage of a daughter ,  which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen ,  was now on the point of accomplishment ,  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials ,  fine muslins ,  new carriages ,  and servants .
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter ,  and ,  without knowing or considering what their income might be ,  rejected many as deficient in size and importance .
haye park might do ,  said she ,  if the gouldings could quit it — or the great house at stoke ,  if the drawingroom were larger ;  but ashworth is too far off !
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ;  and as for pulvis lodge ,  the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained .
but when they had withdrawn ,  he said to her :  mrs .
bennet ,  before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter ,  let us come to a right understanding .
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance .
i will not encourage the impudence of either ,  by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration ;  but mr. bennet was firm .
it soon led to another ;  and mrs. bennet found ,  with amazement and horror ,  that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion .
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it .
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid ,  exceeded all she could believe possible .
she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials ,  than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place .
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had ,  from the distress of the moment ,  been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ;  for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement ,  they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means .
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ;  but ,  at the same time ,  there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much — not ,  however ,  from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself ,  for ,  at any rate ,  there seemed a gulf impassable between them .
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms ,  it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family where ,  to every other objection ,  would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned .
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink .
the wish of procuring her regard ,  which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire ,  could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .
she was humbled ,  she was grieved ;  she repented ,  though she hardly knew of what .
she became jealous of his esteem ,  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .
she wanted to hear of him ,  when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ,  when it was no longer likely they should meet .
what a triumph for him ,  as she often thought ,  could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago ,  would now have been most gladly and gratefully received !
he was as generous ,  she doubted not ,  as the most generous of his sex ;  but while he was mortal ,  there must be a triumph .
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who ,  in disposition and talents ,  would most suit her .
his understanding and temper ,  though unlike her own ,  would have answered all her wishes .
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ;  by her ease and liveliness ,  his mind might have been softened ,  his manners improved ;  and from his judgement ,  information ,  and knowledge of the world ,  she must have received benefit of greater importance .
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .
an union of a different tendency ,  and precluding the possibility of the other ,  was soon to be formed in their family .
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence ,  she could not imagine .
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue ,  she could easily conjecture .
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .
to mr. bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied ,  with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ;  and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .
it was greatly my wish that he should do so ,  he added ,  as soon as his marriage was fixed on .
and i think you will agree with me ,  in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable ,  both on his account and my nieces .
it is mr. wickhams intention to go into the regulars ;  and among his former friends ,  there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general  —  — s regiment ,  now quartered in the north .
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
he promises fairly ;  and i hope among different people ,  where they may each have a character to preserve ,  they will both be more prudent .
i have written to colonel forster ,  to inform him of our present arrangements ,  and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton ,  with assurances of speedy payment ,  for which i have pledged myself .
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton ,  of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information ?
he has given in all his debts ;  i hope at least he has not deceived us .
haggerston has our directions ,  and all will be completed in a week .
they will then join his regiment ,  unless they are first invited to longbourn ;  and i understand from mrs. gardiner ,  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south .
she is well ,  and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother — yours ,  etc ,  e .
gardiner mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the  —  — shire as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .
but mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it .
lydias being settled in the north ,  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company ,  for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire ,  was a severe disappointment ;  and ,  besides ,  it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody ,  and had so many favourites .
she is so fond of mrs. forster ,  said she ,  it will be quite shocking to send her away !
and there are several of the young men ,  too ,  that she likes very much .
the officers may not be so pleasant in general  —  — s regiment his daughters request ,  for such it might be considered ,  of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north ,  received at first an absolute negative .
but jane and elizabeth ,  who agreed in wishing ,  for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence ,  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents ,  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly ,  to receive her and her husband at longbourn ,  as soon as they were married ,  that he was prevailed on to think as they thought ,  and act as they wished .
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north .
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother ,  therefore ,  he sent his permission for them to come ;  and it was settled ,  that as soon as the ceremony was over ,  they should proceed to longbourn .
elizabeth was surprised ,  however ,  that wickham should consent to such a scheme ,  and had she consulted only her own inclination ,  any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .
their sisters wedding day arrived ;  and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .
the carriage was sent to meet them at  —  —  ,  and they were to return in it by dinnertime .
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ,  and jane more especially ,  who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself ,  had she been the culprit ,  and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .
they came .
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them .
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet as the carriage drove up to the door ;  her husband looked impenetrably grave ;  her daughters ,  alarmed ,  anxious ,  uneasy .
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule ;  the door was thrown open ,  and she ran into the room .
her mother stepped forwards ,  embraced her ,  and welcomed her with rapture ;  gave her hand ,  with an affectionate smile ,  to wickham ,  who followed his lady ;  and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .
their reception from mr. bennet ,  to whom they then turned ,  was not quite so cordial .
his countenance rather gained in austerity ;  and he scarcely opened his lips .
the easy assurance of the young couple ,  indeed ,  was enough to provoke him .
elizabeth was disgusted ,  and even miss bennet was shocked .
lydia was lydia still ;  untamed ,  unabashed ,  wild ,  noisy ,  and fearless .
she turned from sister to sister ,  demanding their congratulations ;  and when at length they all sat down ,  looked eagerly round the room ,  took notice of some little alteration in it ,  and observed ,  with a laugh ,  that it was a great while since she had been there .
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ,  but his manners were always so pleasing ,  that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought ,  his smiles and his easy address ,  while he claimed their relationship ,  would have delighted them all .
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ;  but she sat down ,  resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
she blushed ,  and jane blushed ;  but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour .
there was no want of discourse .
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ;  and wickham ,  who happened to sit near elizabeth ,  began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood ,  with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ;  and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
only think of its being three months ,  she cried ,  since i went away ;  it seems but a fortnight i declare ;  and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .
good gracious !
when i went away ,  i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again !
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes .
jane was distressed .
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ;  but she ,  who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible ,  gaily continued ,  oh !
mamma ,  do the people hereabouts know i am married today ?
i was afraid they might not ;  and we overtook william goulding in his curricle ,  so i was determined he should know it ,  and so i let down the sideglass next to him ,  and took off my glove ,  and let my hand just rest upon the window frame ,  so that he might see the ring ,  and then i bowed and smiled like anything elizabeth could bear it no longer .
she got up ,  and ran out of the room ;  and returned no more ,  till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia ,  with anxious parade ,  walk up to her mothers right hand ,  and hear her say to her eldest sister ,  ah !
jane ,  i take your place now ,  and you must go lower ,  because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first .
her ease and good spirits increased .
she longed to see mrs. phillips ,  the lucases ,  and all their other neighbours ,  and to hear herself called mrs .
wickham by each of them ;  and in the mean time ,  she went after dinner to show her ring ,  and boast of being married ,  to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .
well ,  mamma ,  said she ,  when they were all returned to the breakfast room ,  and what do you think of my husband ?
is not he a charming man ?
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .
i only hope they may have half my good luck .
they must all go to brighton .
that is the place to get husbands .
what a pity it is ,  mamma ,  we did not all go very true ;  and if i had my will ,  we should .
but my dear lydia ,  i dont at all like your going such a way off .
must it be so oh ,  lord !
yes ;  — there is nothing in that .
i shall like it of all things .
you and papa ,  and my sisters ,  must come down and see us .
we shall be at newcastle all the winter ,  and i dare say there will be some balls ,  and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond anything said her mother .
and then when you go away ,  you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ;  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour ,  said elizabeth ;  but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london ,  and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .
no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short ;  and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter ,  and having very frequent parties at home .
these parties were acceptable to all ;  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think ,  than such as did not .
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ;  not equal to lydias for him .
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied ,  from the reason of things ,  that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love ,  rather than by his ;  and she would have wondered why ,  without violently caring for her ,  he chose to elope with her at all ,  had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ;  and if that were the case ,  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ;  no one was to be put in competition with him .
he did every thing best in the world ;  and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september ,  than any body else in the country .
one morning ,  soon after their arrival ,  as she was sitting with her two elder sisters ,  she said to elizabeth :  lizzy ,  i never gave you an account of my wedding ,  i believe .
you were not by ,  when i told mamma and the others all about it .
are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really ,  replied elizabeth ;  i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la !
you are so strange !
but i must tell you how it went off .
we were married ,  you know ,  at st .
clements ,  because wickhams lodgings were in that parish .
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock .
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ;  and the others were to meet us at the church .
well ,  monday morning came ,  and i was in such a fuss !
i was so afraid ,  you know ,  that something would happen to put it off ,  and then i should have gone quite distracted .
and there was my aunt ,  all the time i was dressing ,  preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .
however ,  i did not hear above one word in ten ,  for i was thinking ,  you may suppose ,  of my dear wickham .
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well ,  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ;  i thought it would never be over ;  for ,  by the bye ,  you are to understand ,  that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .
if youll believe me ,  i did not once put my foot out of doors ,  though i was there a fortnight .
not one party ,  or scheme ,  or anything .
to be sure london was rather thin ,  but ,  however ,  the little theatre was open .
well ,  and so just as the carriage came to the door ,  my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .
and then ,  you know ,  when once they get together ,  there is no end of it .
well ,  i was so frightened i did not know what to do ,  for my uncle was to give me away ;  and if we were beyond the hour ,  we could not be married all day .
but ,  luckily ,  he came back again in ten minutes time ,  and then we all set out .
however ,  i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going ,  the wedding need not be put off ,  for mr. darcy might have done as well mr .
darcy repeated elizabeth ,  in utter amazement .
oh ,  yes — he was to come there with wickham ,  you know .
but gracious me !
i quite forgot !
i ought not to have said a word about it .
i promised them so faithfully !
what will wickham say ?
it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret ,  said jane ,  say not another word on the subject .
you may depend upon my seeking no further oh !
certainly ,  said elizabeth ,  though burning with curiosity ;  we will ask you no questions thank you ,  said lydia ,  for if you did ,  i should certainly tell you all ,  and then wickham would be angry on such encouragement to ask ,  elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power ,  by running away .
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ;  or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
mr. darcy had been at her sisters wedding .
it was exactly a scene ,  and exactly among people ,  where he had apparently least to do ,  and least temptation to go .
conjectures as to the meaning of it ,  rapid and wild ,  hurried into her brain ;  but she was satisfied with none .
those that best pleased her ,  as placing his conduct in the noblest light ,  seemed most improbable .
she could not bear such suspense ;  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper ,  wrote a short letter to her aunt ,  to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt ,  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .
you may readily comprehend ,  she added ,  what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us ,  and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family ,  should have been amongst you at such a time .
pray write instantly ,  and let me understand it — unless it is ,  for very cogent reasons ,  to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ;  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i shall ,  though ,  she added to herself ,  as she finished the letter ;  and my dear aunt ,  if you do not tell me in an honourable manner ,  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ;  elizabeth was glad of it ;  — till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction ,  she had rather be without a confidante .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could .
she was no sooner in possession of it than ,  hurrying into the little copse ,  where she was least likely to be interrupted ,  she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy ;  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .
gracechurch street ,  sept .
 .
my dear niece ,  i have just received your letter ,  and shall devote this whole morning to answering it ,  as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .
i must confess myself surprised by your application ;  i did not expect it from you .
dont think me angry ,  however ,  for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side .
if you do not choose to understand me ,  forgive my impertinence .
your uncle is as much surprised as i am — and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done .
but if you are really innocent and ignorant ,  i must be more explicit .
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn ,  your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .
mr. darcy called ,  and was shut up with him several hours .
it was all over before i arrived ;  so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been .
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were ,  and that he had seen and talked with them both ;  wickham repeatedly ,  lydia once .
from what i can collect ,  he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves ,  and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him .
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride ,  and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world .
his character was to speak for itself .
he called it ,  therefore ,  his duty to step forward ,  and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself .
if he had another motive ,  i am sure it would never disgrace him .
he had been some days in town ,  before he was able to discover them ;  but he had something to direct his search ,  which was more than we had ;  and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us .
there is a lady ,  it seems ,  a mrs. younge ,  who was some time ago governess to miss darcy ,  and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation ,  though he did not say what .
she then took a large house in edwardstreet ,  and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .
this mrs. younge was ,  he knew ,  intimately acquainted with wickham ;  and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town .
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
she would not betray her trust ,  i suppose ,  without bribery and corruption ,  for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london ,  and had she been able to receive them into her house ,  they would have taken up their abode with her .
at length ,  however ,  our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction .
they were in  —  —  street .
he saw wickham ,  and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
his first object with her ,  he acknowledged ,  had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation ,  and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her ,  offering his assistance ,  as far as it would go .
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
she cared for none of her friends ;  she wanted no help of his ;  she would not hear of leaving wickham .
she was sure they should be married some time or other ,  and it did not much signify when .
since such were her feelings ,  it only remained ,  he thought ,  to secure and expedite a marriage ,  which ,  in his very first conversation with wickham ,  he easily learnt had never been his design .
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment ,  on account of some debts of honour ,  which were very pressing ;  and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone .
he meant to resign his commission immediately ;  and as to his future situation ,  he could conjecture very little about it .
he must go somewhere ,  but he did not know where ,  and he knew he should have nothing to live on .
mr .
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich ,  he would have been able to do something for him ,  and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .
but he found ,  in reply to this question ,  that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country .
under such circumstances ,  however ,  he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
they met several times ,  for there was much to be discussed .
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ;  but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
everything being settled between them ,  mr. darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it ,  and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .
but mr. gardiner could not be seen ,  and mr. darcy found ,  on further inquiry ,  that your father was still with him ,  but would quit town the next morning .
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle ,  and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former .
he did not leave his name ,  and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .
on saturday he came again .
your father was gone ,  your uncle at home ,  and ,  as i said before ,  they had a great deal of talk together .
they met again on sunday ,  and then i saw him too .
it was not all settled before monday :  as soon as it was ,  the express was sent off to longbourn .
but our visitor was very obstinate .
i fancy ,  lizzy ,  that obstinacy is the real defect of his character ,  after all .
he has been accused of many faults at different times ,  but this is the true one .
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ;  though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked ,  therefore say nothing about it ,  your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .
they battled it together for a long time ,  which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
but at last your uncle was forced to yield ,  and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece ,  was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it ,  which went sorely against the grain ;  and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure ,  because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers ,  and give the praise where it was due .
but ,  lizzy ,  this must go no farther than yourself ,  or jane at most .
you know pretty well ,  i suppose ,  what has been done for the young people .
his debts are to be paid ,  amounting ,  i believe ,  to considerably more than a thousand pounds ,  another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her ,  and his commission purchased .
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone ,  was such as i have given above .
it was owing to him ,  to his reserve and want of proper consideration ,  that wickhams character had been so misunderstood ,  and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .
perhaps there was some truth in this ;  though i doubt whether his reserve ,  or anybodys reserve ,  can be answerable for the event .
but in spite of all this fine talking ,  my dear lizzy ,  you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded ,  if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .
when all this was resolved on ,  he returned again to his friends ,  who were still staying at pemberley ;  but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place ,  and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .
i believe i have now told you every thing .
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ;  i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .
lydia came to us ;  and wickham had constant admission to the house .
he was exactly what he had been ,  when i knew him in hertfordshire ;  but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us ,  if i had not perceived ,  by janes letter last wednesday ,  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it ,  and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain .
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner ,  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done ,  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .
if she heard me ,  it was by good luck ,  for i am sure she did not listen .
i was sometimes quite provoked ,  but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane ,  and for their sakes had patience with her .
mr .
darcy was punctual in his return ,  and as lydia informed you ,  attended the wedding .
he dined with us the next day ,  and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
will you be very angry with me ,  my dear lizzy ,  if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him .
his behaviour to us has ,  in every respect ,  been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .
his understanding and opinions all please me ;  he wants nothing but a little more liveliness ,  and that ,  if he marry prudently ,  his wife may teach him .
i thought him very sly ;  — he hardly ever mentioned your name .
but slyness seems the fashion .
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming ,  or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p .
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .
a low phaeton ,  with a nice little pair of ponies ,  would be the very thing .
but i must write no more .
the children have been wanting me this half hour .
yours ,  very sincerely ,  m .
gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits ,  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match ,  which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable ,  and at the same time dreaded to be just ,  from the pain of obligation ,  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !
he had followed them purposely to town ,  he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ;  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise ,  and where he was reduced to meet ,  frequently meet ,  reason with ,  persuade ,  and finally bribe ,  the man whom he always most wished to avoid ,  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her .
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations ,  and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient ,  when required to depend on his affection for her — for a woman who had already refused him — as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .
brotherinlaw of wickham !
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
he had ,  to be sure ,  done much .
she was ashamed to think how much .
but he had given a reason for his interference ,  which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ;  he had liberality ,  and he had the means of exercising it ;  and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement ,  she could ,  perhaps ,  believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
it was painful ,  exceedingly painful ,  to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .
they owed the restoration of lydia ,  her character ,  every thing ,  to him .
oh !
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged ,  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .
for herself she was humbled ;  but she was proud of him .
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour ,  he had been able to get the better of himself .
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again .
it was hardly enough ;  but it pleased her .
she was even sensible of some pleasure ,  though mixed with regret ,  on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .
she was roused from her seat ,  and her reflections ,  by some ones approach ;  and before she could strike into another path ,  she was overtaken by wickham .
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble ,  my dear sister said he ,  as he joined her .
you certainly do ,  she replied with a smile ;  but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed ,  if it were .
we were always good friends ;  and now we are better true .
are the others coming out i do not know .
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .
and so ,  my dear sister ,  i find ,  from our uncle and aunt ,  that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative .
i almost envy you the pleasure ,  and yet i believe it would be too much for me ,  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .
and you saw the old housekeeper ,  i suppose ?
poor reynolds ,  she was always very fond of me .
but of course she did not mention my name to you yes ,  she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army ,  and she was afraid had — not turned out well .
at such a distance as that ,  you know ,  things are strangely misrepresented certainly ,  he replied ,  biting his lips .
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ;  but he soon afterwards said :  i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .
we passed each other several times .
i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh ,  said elizabeth .
it must be something particular ,  to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly .
did you see him while you were at lambton ?
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes ;  he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard ,  indeed ,  that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .
when i last saw her ,  she was not very promising .
i am very glad you liked her .
i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will ;  she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it ,  because it is the living which i ought to have had .
a most delightful place — excellent parsonage house !
it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well .
i should have considered it as part of my duty ,  and the exertion would soon have been nothing .
one ought not to repine ;  — but ,  to be sure ,  it would have been such a thing for me !
the quiet ,  the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness !
but it was not to be .
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance ,  when you were in kent i have heard from authority ,  which i thought as good ,  that it was left you conditionally only ,  and at the will of the present patron you have .
yes ,  there was something in that ;  i told you so from the first ,  you may remember i did hear ,  too ,  that there was a time ,  when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ;  that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders ,  and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did !
and it was not wholly without foundation .
you may remember what i told you on that point ,  when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house ,  for she had walked fast to get rid of him ;  and unwilling ,  for her sisters sake ,  to provoke him ,  she only said in reply ,  with a goodhumoured smile :  come ,  mr. wickham ,  we are brother and sister ,  you know .
do not let us quarrel about the past .
in future ,  i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand ;  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry ,  though he hardly knew how to look ,  and they entered the house .
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself ,  or provoked his dear sister elizabeth ,  by introducing the subject of it ;  and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .
the day of his and lydias departure soon came ,  and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation ,  which ,  as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle ,  was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .
oh !
my dear lydia ,  she cried ,  when shall we meet again oh ,  lord !
i dont know .
not these two or three years ,  perhaps write to me very often ,  my dear as often as i can .
but you know married women have never much time for writing .
my sisters may write to me .
they will have nothing else to do mr. wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes .
he smiled ,  looked handsome ,  and said many pretty things .
he is as fine a fellow ,  said mr. bennet ,  as soon as they were out of the house ,  as ever i saw .
he simpers ,  and smirks ,  and makes love to us all .
i am prodigiously proud of him .
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .
i often think ,  said she ,  that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends .
one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence ,  you see ,  madam ,  of marrying a daughter ,  said elizabeth .
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing .
lydia does not leave me because she is married ,  but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off .
if that had been nearer ,  she would not have gone so soon but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved ,  and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope ,  by an article of news which then began to be in circulation .
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master ,  who was coming down in a day or two ,  to shoot there for several weeks .
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .
she looked at jane ,  and smiled and shook her head by turns .
well ,  well ,  and so mr. bingley is coming down ,  sister ,  for mrs. phillips first brought her the news .
well ,  so much the better .
not that i care about it ,  though .
he is nothing to us ,  you know ,  and i am sure i never want to see him again .
but ,  however ,  he is very welcome to come to netherfield ,  if he likes it .
and who knows what may happen ?
but that is nothing to us .
you know ,  sister ,  we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .
and so ,  is it quite certain he is coming you may depend on it ,  replied the other ,  for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ;  i saw her passing by ,  and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ;  and she told me that it was certain true .
he comes down on thursday at the latest ,  very likely on wednesday .
she was going to the butchers ,  she told me ,  on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday ,  and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour .
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ;  but now ,  as soon as they were alone together ,  she said :  i saw you look at me today ,  lizzy ,  when my aunt told us of the present report ;  and i know i appeared distressed .
but dont imagine it was from any silly cause .
i was only confused for the moment ,  because i felt that i should be looked at .
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .
i am glad of one thing ,  that he comes alone ;  because we shall see the less of him .
not that i am afraid of myself ,  but i dread other peoples remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
had she not seen him in derbyshire ,  she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged ;  but she still thought him partial to jane ,  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission ,  or being bold enough to come without it .
yet it is hard ,  she sometimes thought ,  that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired ,  without raising all this speculation !
i will leave him to himself in spite of what her sister declared ,  and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival ,  elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .
they were more disturbed ,  more unequal ,  than she had often seen them .
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents ,  about a twelvemonth ago ,  was now brought forward again .
as soon as ever mr. bingley comes ,  my dear ,  said mrs. bennet ,  you will wait on him of course no ,  no .
you forced me into visiting him last year ,  and promised ,  if i went to see him ,  he should marry one of my daughters .
but it ended in nothing ,  and i will not be sent on a fools errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen ,  on his returning to netherfield .
tis an etiquette i despise ,  said he .
if he wants our society ,  let him seek it .
he knows where we live .
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well ,  all i know is ,  that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .
but ,  however ,  that shant prevent my asking him to dine here ,  i am determined .
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .
that will make thirteen with ourselves ,  so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution ,  she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility ;  though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley ,  in consequence of it ,  before they did .
as the day of his arrival drew near ,  —  i begin to be sorry that he comes at all ,  said jane to her sister .
it would be nothing ;  i could see him with perfect indifference ,  but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .
my mother means well ;  but she does not know ,  no one can know ,  how much i suffer from what she says .
happy shall i be ,  when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say anything to comfort you ,  replied elizabeth ;  but it is wholly out of my power .
you must feel it ;  and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me ,  because you have always so much mr. bingley arrived .
mrs. bennet ,  through the assistance of servants ,  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it ,  that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could .
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ;  hopeless of seeing him before .
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire ,  she saw him ,  from her dressingroom window ,  enter the paddock and ride towards the house .
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ;  but elizabeth ,  to satisfy her mother ,  went to the window — she looked ,  — she saw mr. darcy with him ,  and sat down again by her sister .
there is a gentleman with him ,  mamma ,  said kitty ;  who can it be some acquaintance or other ,  my dear ,  i suppose ;  i am sure i do not know la replied kitty ,  it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .
mr. whatshisname .
that tall ,  proud man good gracious !
mr. darcy — and so it does ,  i vow .
well ,  any friend of mr. bingleys will always be welcome here ,  to be sure ;  but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire ,  and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister ,  in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .
each felt for the other ,  and of course for themselves ;  and their mother talked on ,  of her dislike of mr. darcy ,  and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingleys friend ,  without being heard by either of them .
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane ,  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiners letter ,  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .
to jane ,  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused ,  and whose merit she had undervalued ;  but to her own more extensive information ,  he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits ,  and whom she regarded herself with an interest ,  if not quite so tender ,  at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley .
her astonishment at his coming — at his coming to netherfield ,  to longbourn ,  and voluntarily seeking her again ,  was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .
the colour which had been driven from her face ,  returned for half a minute with an additional glow ,  and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes ,  as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .
but she would not be secure .
let me first see how he behaves ,  said she ;  it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work ,  striving to be composed ,  and without daring to lift up her eyes ,  till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door .
jane looked a little paler than usual ,  but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .
on the gentlemens appearing ,  her colour increased ;  yet she received them with tolerable ease ,  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance .
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow ,  and sat down again to her work ,  with an eagerness which it did not often command .
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .
he looked serious ,  as usual ;  and ,  she thought ,  more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire ,  than as she had seen him at pemberley .
but ,  perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
it was a painful ,  but not an improbable ,  conjecture .
bingley ,  she had likewise seen for an instant ,  and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed ,  especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .
elizabeth ,  particularly ,  who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy ,  was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .
darcy ,  after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did ,  a question which she could not answer without confusion ,  said scarcely anything .
he was not seated by her ;  perhaps that was the reason of his silence ;  but it had not been so in derbyshire .
there he had talked to her friends ,  when he could not to herself .
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice ;  and when occasionally ,  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity ,  she raised her eyes to his face ,  she as often found him looking at jane as at herself ,  and frequently on no object but the ground .
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please ,  than when they last met ,  were plainly expressed .
she was disappointed ,  and angry with herself for being so .
could i expect it to be otherwise said she .
yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself ;  and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
she inquired after his sister ,  but could do no more .
it is a long time ,  mr. bingley ,  since you went away ,  said mrs. bennet .
he readily agreed to it .
i began to be afraid you would never come back again .
people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ;  but ,  however ,  i hope it is not true .
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood ,  since you went away .
miss lucas is married and settled .
and one of my own daughters .
i suppose you have heard of it ;  indeed ,  you must have seen it in the papers .
it was in the times and the courier ,  i know ;  though it was not put in as it ought to be .
it was only said ,  lately ,  george wickham ,  esq .
to miss lydia bennet ,  without there being a syllable said of her father ,  or the place where she lived ,  or anything .
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too ,  and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .
did you see it bingley replied that he did ,  and made his congratulations .
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .
how mr. darcy looked ,  therefore ,  she could not tell .
it is a delightful thing ,  to be sure ,  to have a daughter well married ,  continued her mother ,  but at the same time ,  mr. bingley ,  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .
they are gone down to newcastle ,  a place quite northward ,  it seems ,  and there they are to stay i do not know how long .
his regiment is there ;  for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the  —  — shire ,  and of his being gone into the regulars .
thank heaven !
he has some friends ,  though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth ,  who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy ,  was in such misery of shame ,  that she could hardly keep her seat .
it drew from her ,  however ,  the exertion of speaking ,  which nothing else had so effectually done before ;  and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .
a few weeks ,  he believed .
when you have killed all your own birds ,  mr. bingley ,  said her mother ,  i beg you will come here ,  and shoot as many as you please on mr. bennets manor .
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you ,  and will save all the best of the covies for you elizabeths misery increased ,  at such unnecessary ,  such officious attention !
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago ,  every thing ,  she was persuaded ,  would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .
at that instant ,  she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion .
the first wish of my heart ,  said she to herself ,  is never more to be in company with either of them .
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this !
let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery ,  for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation ,  received soon afterwards material relief ,  from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover .
when first he came in ,  he had spoken to her but little ;  but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ;  as good natured ,  and as unaffected ,  though not quite so chatty .
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all ,  and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .
but her mind was so busily engaged ,  that she did not always know when she was silent .
when the gentlemen rose to go away ,  mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility ,  and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .
you are quite a visit in my debt ,  mr. bingley ,  she added ,  for when you went to town last winter ,  you promised to take a family dinner with us ,  as soon as you returned .
i have not forgot ,  you see ;  and i assure you ,  i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection ,  and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business .
they then went away .
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ;  but ,  though she always kept a very good table ,  she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs ,  or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year .
as soon as they were gone ,  elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ;  or in other words ,  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
mr. darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her .
why ,  if he came only to be silent ,  grave ,  and indifferent ,  said she ,  did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .
he could be still amiable ,  still pleasing ,  to my uncle and aunt ,  when he was in town ;  and why not to me ?
if he fears me ,  why come hither ?
if he no longer cares for me ,  why silent ?
teasing ,  teasing ,  man !
i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister ,  who joined her with a cheerful look ,  which showed her better satisfied with their visitors ,  than elizabeth .
now ,  said she ,  that this first meeting is over ,  i feel perfectly easy .
i know my own strength ,  and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .
it will then be publicly seen that ,  on both sides ,  we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes ,  very indifferent indeed ,  said elizabeth ,  laughingly .
oh ,  jane ,  take care my dear lizzy ,  you cannot think me so weak ,  as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ;  and mrs. bennet ,  in the meanwhile ,  was giving way to all the happy schemes ,  which the good humour and common politeness of bingley ,  in half an hours visit ,  had revived .
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ;  and the two who were most anxiously expected ,  to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen ,  were in very good time .
when they repaired to the diningroom ,  elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place ,  which ,  in all their former parties ,  had belonged to him ,  by her sister .
her prudent mother ,  occupied by the same ideas ,  forbore to invite him to sit by herself .
on entering the room ,  he seemed to hesitate ;  but jane happened to look round ,  and happened to smile :  it was decided .
he placed himself by her .
elizabeth ,  with a triumphant sensation ,  looked towards his friend .
he bore it with noble indifference ,  and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy ,  had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy ,  with an expression of halflaughing alarm .
his behaviour to her sister was such ,  during dinner time ,  as showed an admiration of her ,  which ,  though more guarded than formerly ,  persuaded elizabeth ,  that if left wholly to himself ,  janes happiness ,  and his own ,  would be speedily secured .
though she dared not depend upon the consequence ,  she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ;  for she was in no cheerful humour .
mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them .
he was on one side of her mother .
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either ,  or make either appear to advantage .
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse ,  but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other ,  and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did .
her mothers ungraciousness ,  made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind ;  and she would ,  at times ,  have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ;  that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .
anxious and uneasy ,  the period which passed in the drawingroom ,  before the gentlemen came ,  was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil .
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .
if he does not come to me ,  then ,  said she ,  i shall give him up for ever the gentlemen came ;  and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ;  but ,  alas !
the ladies had crowded round the table ,  where miss bennet was making tea ,  and elizabeth pouring out the coffee ,  in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair .
and on the gentlemens approaching ,  one of the girls moved closer to her than ever ,  and said ,  in a whisper :  the men shant come and part us ,  i am determined .
we want none of them ;  do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room .
she followed him with her eyes ,  envied everyone to whom he spoke ,  had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ;  and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !
a man who has once been refused !
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?
is there one among the sex ,  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived ,  however ,  by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ;  and she seized the opportunity of saying :  is your sister at pemberley still yes ,  she will remain there till christmas and quite alone ?
have all her friends left her mrs .
annesley is with her .
the others have been gone on to scarborough ,  these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say ;  but if he wished to converse with her ,  he might have better success .
he stood by her ,  however ,  for some minutes ,  in silence ;  and ,  at last ,  on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again ,  he walked away .
when the teathings were removed ,  and the cardtables placed ,  the ladies all rose ,  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him ,  when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players ,  and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .
they were confined for the evening at different tables ,  and she had nothing to hope ,  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room ,  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ;  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others ,  and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
well girls ,  said she ,  as soon as they were left to themselves ,  what say you to the day ?
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well ,  i assure you .
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .
the venison was roasted to a turn — and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch .
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week ;  and even mr. darcy acknowledged ,  that the partridges were remarkably well done ;  and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .
and ,  my dear jane ,  i never saw you look in greater beauty .
mrs. long said so too ,  for i asked her whether you did not .
and what do you think she said besides ?
ah !
mrs. bennet ,  we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed .
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived — and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls ,  and not at all handsome :  i like them prodigiously mrs. bennet ,  in short ,  was in very great spirits ;  she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane ,  to be convinced that she would get him at last ;  and her expectations of advantage to her family ,  when in a happy humour ,  were so far beyond reason ,  that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day ,  to make his proposals .
it has been a very agreeable day ,  said miss bennet to elizabeth .
the party seemed so well selected ,  so suitable one with the other .
i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled .
lizzy ,  you must not do so .
you must not suspect me .
it mortifies me .
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man ,  without having a wish beyond it .
i am perfectly satisfied ,  from what his manners now are ,  that he never had any design of engaging my affection .
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address ,  and a stronger desire of generally pleasing ,  than any other man you are very cruel ,  said her sister ,  you will not let me smile ,  and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .
we all love to instruct ,  though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .
forgive me ;  and if you persist in indifference ,  do not make me your confidante a few days after this visit ,  mr. bingley called again ,  and alone .
his friend had left him that morning for london ,  but was to return home in ten days time .
he sat with them above an hour ,  and was in remarkably good spirits .
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ;  but ,  with many expressions of concern ,  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
next time you call ,  said she ,  i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time ,  etc .
etc ;  and if she would give him leave ,  would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
can you come tomorrow yes ,  he had no engagement at all for tomorrow ;  and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
he came ,  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed .
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters room ,  in her dressing gown ,  and with her hair half finished ,  crying out :  my dear jane ,  make haste and hurry down .
he is come — mr .
bingley is come .
he is ,  indeed .
make haste ,  make haste .
here ,  sarah ,  come to miss bennet this moment ,  and help her on with her gown .
never mind miss lizzys hair we will be down as soon as we can ,  said jane ;  but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us ,  for she went up stairs half an hour ago oh !
hang kitty !
what has she to do with it ?
come be quick ,  be quick !
where is your sash ,  my dear but when her mother was gone ,  jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening .
after tea ,  mr. bennet retired to the library ,  as was his custom ,  and mary went up stairs to her instrument .
two obstacles of the five being thus removed ,  mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time ,  without making any impression on them .
elizabeth would not observe her ;  and when at last kitty did ,  she very innocently said ,  what is the matter mamma ?
what do you keep winking at me for ?
what am i to do nothing child ,  nothing .
i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer ;  but unable to waste such a precious occasion ,  she suddenly got up ,  and saying to kitty ,  come here ,  my love ,  i want to speak to you ,  took her out of the room .
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation ,  and her entreaty that she would not give in to it .
in a few minutes ,  mrs. bennet halfopened the door and called out :  lizzy ,  my dear ,  i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go .
we may as well leave them by themselves you know ;  said her mother ,  as soon as she was in the hall .
kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressingroom elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother ,  but remained quietly in the hall ,  till she and kitty were out of sight ,  then returned into the drawingroom .
mrs. bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual .
bingley was every thing that was charming ,  except the professed lover of her daughter .
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ;  and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother ,  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter .
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ;  and before he went away ,  an engagement was formed ,  chiefly through his own and mrs. bennets means ,  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
after this day ,  jane said no more of her indifference .
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ;  but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded ,  unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time .
seriously ,  however ,  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence .
bingley was punctual to his appointment ;  and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together ,  as had been agreed on .
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule ,  or disgust him into silence ;  and he was more communicative ,  and less eccentric ,  than the other had ever seen him .
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ;  and in the evening mrs. bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
elizabeth ,  who had a letter to write ,  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ;  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards ,  she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes .
but on returning to the drawingroom ,  when her letter was finished ,  she saw ,  to her infinite surprise ,  there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .
on opening the door ,  she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth ,  as if engaged in earnest conversation ;  and had this led to no suspicion ,  the faces of both ,  as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other ,  would have told it all .
their situation was awkward enough ;  but hers she thought was still worse .
not a syllable was uttered by either ;  and elizabeth was on the point of going away again ,  when bingley ,  who as well as the other had sat down ,  suddenly rose ,  and whispering a few words to her sister ,  ran out of the room .
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth ,  where confidence would give pleasure ;  and instantly embracing her ,  acknowledged ,  with the liveliest emotion ,  that she was the happiest creature in the world .
tis too much she added ,  by far too much .
i do not deserve it .
oh !
why is not everybody as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity ,  a warmth ,  a delight ,  which words could but poorly express .
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister ,  or say half that remained to be said for the present .
i must go instantly to my mother ;  she cried .
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ;  or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself .
he is gone to my father already .
oh !
lizzy ,  to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !
how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother ,  who had purposely broken up the card party ,  and was sitting up stairs with kitty .
elizabeth ,  who was left by herself ,  now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled ,  that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .
and this ,  said she ,  is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection !
of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance !
the happiest ,  wisest ,  most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley ,  whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
where is your sister said he hastily ,  as he opened the door .
with my mother up stairs .
she will be down in a moment ,  i dare say he then shut the door ,  and ,  coming up to her ,  claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
they shook hands with great cordiality ;  and then ,  till her sister came down ,  she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness ,  and of janes perfections ;  and in spite of his being a lover ,  elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded ,  because they had for basis the excellent understanding ,  and superexcellent disposition of jane ,  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ;  the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face ,  as made her look handsomer than ever .
kitty simpered and smiled ,  and hoped her turn was coming soon .
mrs. bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings ,  though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour ;  and when mr. bennet joined them at supper ,  his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was .
not a word ,  however ,  passed his lips in allusion to it ,  till their visitor took his leave for the night ;  but as soon as he was gone ,  he turned to his daughter ,  and said :  jane ,  i congratulate you .
you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly ,  kissed him ,  and thanked him for his goodness .
you are a good girl ;  he replied ,  and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
your tempers are by no means unlike .
you are each of you so complying ,  that nothing will ever be resolved on ;  so easy ,  that every servant will cheat you ;  and so generous ,  that you will always exceed your income i hope not so .
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me exceed their income !
my dear mr. bennet ,  cried his wife ,  what are you talking of ?
why ,  he has four or five thousand a year ,  and very likely more then addressing her daughter ,  oh !
my dear ,  dear jane ,  i am so happy !
i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night .
i knew how it would be .
i always said it must be so ,  at last .
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
i remember ,  as soon as ever i saw him ,  when he first came into hertfordshire last year ,  i thought how likely it was that you should come together .
oh !
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham ,  lydia ,  were all forgotten .
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .
at that moment ,  she cared for no other .
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ;  and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .
bingley ,  from this time ,  was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ;  coming frequently before breakfast ,  and always remaining till after supper ;  unless when some barbarous neighbour ,  who could not be enough detested ,  had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept .
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ;  for while he was present ,  jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else ;  but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .
in the absence of jane ,  he always attached himself to elizabeth ,  for the pleasure of talking of her ;  and when bingley was gone ,  jane constantly sought the same means of relief .
he has made me so happy ,  said she ,  one evening ,  by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
i had not believed it possible i suspected as much ,  replied elizabeth .
but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing .
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me ,  which i cannot wonder at ,  since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
but when they see ,  as i trust they will ,  that their brother is happy with me ,  they will learn to be contented ,  and we shall be on good terms again ;  though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech ,  said elizabeth ,  that i ever heard you utter .
good girl !
it would vex me ,  indeed ,  to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard would you believe it ,  lizzy ,  that when he went to town last november ,  he really loved me ,  and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure ;  but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence ,  and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ;  for ,  though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world ,  she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane .
oh !
lizzy ,  why am i thus singled from my family ,  and blessed above them all !
if i could but see you as happy !
if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men ,  i never could be so happy as you .
till i have your disposition ,  your goodness ,  i never can have your happiness .
no ,  no ,  let me shift for myself ;  and ,  perhaps ,  if i have very good luck ,  i may meet with another mr. collins in time the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. phillips ,  and she ventured ,  without any permission ,  to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world ,  though only a few weeks before ,  when lydia had first run away ,  they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .
one morning ,  about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed ,  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom ,  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window ,  by the sound of a carriage ;  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .
it was too early in the morning for visitors ,  and besides ,  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
the horses were post ;  and neither the carriage ,  nor the livery of the servant who preceded it ,  were familiar to them .
as it was certain ,  however ,  that somebody was coming ,  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion ,  and walk away with him into the shrubbery .
they both set off ,  and the conjectures of the remaining three continued ,  though with little satisfaction ,  till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered .
it was lady catherine de bourgh .
they were of course all intending to be surprised ;  but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ;  and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty ,  though she was perfectly unknown to them ,  even inferior to what elizabeth felt .
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious ,  made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head ,  and sat down without saying a word .
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance ,  though no request of introduction had been made .
mrs. bennet ,  all amazement ,  though flattered by having a guest of such high importance ,  received her with the utmost politeness .
after sitting for a moment in silence ,  she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,  i hope you are well ,  miss bennet .
that lady ,  i suppose ,  is your mother elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .
and that i suppose is one of your sisters yes ,  madam ,  said mrs. bennet ,  delighted to speak to lady catherine .
she is my youngest girl but one .
my youngest of all is lately married ,  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds ,  walking with a young man who ,  i believe ,  will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here ,  returned lady catherine after a short silence .
it is nothing in comparison of rosings ,  my lady ,  i dare say ;  but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening ,  in summer ;  the windows are full west mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ,  and then added :  may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well yes ,  very well .
i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte ,  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .
but no letter appeared ,  and she was completely puzzled .
mrs. bennet ,  with great civility ,  begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ;  but lady catherine very resolutely ,  and not very politely ,  declined eating anything ;  and then ,  rising up ,  said to elizabeth ,  miss bennet ,  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .
i should be glad to take a turn in it ,  if you will favour me with your company go ,  my dear ,  cried her mother ,  and show her ladyship about the different walks .
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed ,  and running into her own room for her parasol ,  attended her noble guest downstairs .
as they passed through the hall ,  lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom ,  and pronouncing them ,  after a short survey ,  to be decent looking rooms ,  walked on .
her carriage remained at the door ,  and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it .
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ;  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she ,  as she looked in her face .
as soon as they entered the copse ,  lady catherine began in the following manner :  —  you can be at no loss ,  miss bennet ,  to understand the reason of my journey hither .
your own heart ,  your own conscience ,  must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
indeed ,  you are mistaken ,  madam .
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here miss bennet ,  replied her ladyship ,  in an angry tone ,  you ought to know ,  that i am not to be trifled with .
but however insincere you may choose to be ,  you shall not find me so .
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ,  and in a cause of such moment as this ,  i shall certainly not depart from it .
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago .
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married ,  but that you ,  that miss elizabeth bennet ,  would ,  in all likelihood ,  be soon afterwards united to my nephew ,  my own nephew ,  mr. darcy .
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood ,  though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible ,  i instantly resolved on setting off for this place ,  that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true ,  said elizabeth ,  colouring with astonishment and disdain ,  i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .
what could your ladyship propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn ,  to see me and my family ,  said elizabeth coolly ,  will be rather a confirmation of it ;  if ,  indeed ,  such a report is in existence if !
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare ,  that there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer this is not to be borne .
miss bennet ,  i insist on being satisfied .
has he ,  has my nephew ,  made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so ;  it must be so ,  while he retains the use of his reason .
but your arts and allurements may ,  in a moment of infatuation ,  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .
you may have drawn him in if i have ,  i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennet ,  do you know who i am ?
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world ,  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know mine ;  nor will such behaviour as this ,  ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood .
this match ,  to which you have the presumption to aspire ,  can never take place .
no ,  never .
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .
now what have you to say only this ;  that if he is so ,  you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine hesitated for a moment ,  and then replied :  the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
from their infancy ,  they have been intended for each other .
it was the favourite wish of his mother ,  as well as of hers .
while in their cradles ,  we planned the union :  and now ,  at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage ,  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth ,  of no importance in the world ,  and wholly unallied to the family !
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes ,  and i had heard it before .
but what is that to me ?
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew ,  i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage .
its completion depended on others .
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin ,  why is not he to make another choice ?
and if i am that choice ,  why may not i accept him because honour ,  decorum ,  prudence ,  nay ,  interest ,  forbid it .
yes ,  miss bennet ,  interest ;  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends ,  if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
you will be censured ,  slighted ,  and despised ,  by everyone connected with him .
your alliance will be a disgrace ;  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes ,  replied elizabeth .
but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation ,  that she could ,  upon the whole ,  have no cause to repine obstinate ,  headstrong girl !
i am ashamed of you !
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
is nothing due to me on that score ?
let us sit down .
you are to understand ,  miss bennet ,  that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ;  nor will i be dissuaded from it .
i have not been used to submit to any persons whims .
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable ;  but it will have no effect on me i will not be interrupted .
hear me in silence .
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .
they are descended ,  on the maternal side ,  from the same noble line ;  and ,  on the fathers ,  from respectable ,  honourable ,  and ancient — though untitled — families .
their fortune on both sides is splendid .
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ;  and what is to divide them ?
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family ,  connections ,  or fortune .
is this to be endured !
but it must not ,  shall not be .
if you were sensible of your own good ,  you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew ,  i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .
he is a gentleman ;  i am a gentlemans daughter ;  so far we are equal true .
you are a gentlemans daughter .
but who was your mother ?
who are your uncles and aunts ?
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be ,  said elizabeth ,  if your nephew does not object to them ,  they can be nothing to you tell me once for all ,  are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not ,  for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine ,  have answered this question ,  she could not but say ,  after a moments deliberation :  i am not lady catherine seemed pleased .
and will you promise me ,  never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly never shall give it .
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ;  but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable ?
supposing him to be attached to me ,  would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
allow me to say ,  lady catherine ,  that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged .
you have widely mistaken my character ,  if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs ,  i cannot tell ;  but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .
i must beg ,  therefore ,  to be importuned no farther on the subject not so hasty ,  if you please .
i have by no means done .
to all the objections i have already urged ,  i have still another to add .
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement .
i know it all ;  that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business ,  at the expence of your father and uncles .
and is such a girl to be my nephews sister ?
is her husband ,  who is the son of his late fathers steward ,  to be his brother ?
heaven and earth — of what are you thinking ?
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing further to say ,  she resentfully answered .
you have insulted me in every possible method .
i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke .
lady catherine rose also ,  and they turned back .
her ladyship was highly incensed .
you have no regard ,  then ,  for the honour and credit of my nephew !
unfeeling ,  selfish girl !
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine ,  i have nothing further to say .
you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing .
i am only resolved to act in that manner ,  which will ,  in my own opinion ,  constitute my happiness ,  without reference to you ,  or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well .
you refuse ,  then ,  to oblige me .
you refuse to obey the claims of duty ,  honour ,  and gratitude .
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends ,  and make him the contempt of the world neither duty ,  nor honour ,  nor gratitude ,  replied elizabeth ,  have any possible claim on me ,  in the present instance .
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .
and with regard to the resentment of his family ,  or the indignation of the world ,  if the former were excited by his marrying me ,  it would not give me one moments concern — and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion !
this is your final resolve !
very well .
i shall now know how to act .
do not imagine ,  miss bennet ,  that your ambition will ever be gratified .
i came to try you .
i hoped to find you reasonable ;  but ,  depend upon it ,  i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on ,  till they were at the door of the carriage ,  when ,  turning hastily round ,  she added ,  i take no leave of you ,  miss bennet .
i send no compliments to your mother .
you deserve no such attention .
i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer ;  and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house ,  walked quietly into it herself .
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom ,  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .
she did not choose it ,  said her daughter ,  she would go she is a very finelooking woman !
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
for she only came ,  i suppose ,  to tell us the collinses were well .
she is on her road somewhere ,  i dare say ,  and so ,  passing through meryton ,  thought she might as well call on you .
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you ,  lizzy elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ;  for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into ,  could not be easily overcome ;  nor could she ,  for many hours ,  learn to think of it less than incessantly .
lady catherine ,  it appeared ,  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings ,  for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .
it was a rational scheme ,  to be sure !
but from what the report of their engagement could originate ,  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ;  till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley ,  and her being the sister of jane ,  was enough ,  at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another ,  to supply the idea .
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .
and her neighbours at lucas lodge ,  therefore for through their communication with the collinses ,  the report ,  she concluded ,  had reached lady catherine ,  had only set that down as almost certain and immediate ,  which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time .
in revolving lady catherines expressions ,  however ,  she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage ,  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ;  and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her ,  she dared not pronounce .
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt ,  or his dependence on her judgment ,  but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ;  and it was certain that ,  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one ,  whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own ,  his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
with his notions of dignity ,  he would probably feel that the arguments ,  which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous ,  contained much good sense and solid reasoning .
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do ,  which had often seemed likely ,  the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt ,  and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him .
in that case he would return no more .
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ;  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .
if ,  therefore ,  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days ,  she added ,  i shall know how to understand it .
i shall then give over every expectation ,  every wish of his constancy .
if he is satisfied with only regretting me ,  when he might have obtained my affections and hand ,  i shall soon cease to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family ,  on hearing who their visitor had been ,  was very great ;  but they obligingly satisfied it ,  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennets curiosity ;  and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject .
the next morning ,  as she was going downstairs ,  she was met by her father ,  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
lizzy ,  said he ,  i was going to look for you ;  come into my room she followed him thither ;  and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ;  and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .
she followed her father to the fire place ,  and they both sat down .
he then said ,  i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
as it principally concerns yourself ,  you ought to know its contents .
i did not know before ,  that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew ,  instead of the aunt ;  and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all ,  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ;  when her father continued :  you look conscious .
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ;  but i think i may defy even your sagacity ,  to discover the name of your admirer .
this letter is from mr. collins from mr. collins !
and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course .
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter ,  of which ,  it seems ,  he has been told by some of the goodnatured ,  gossiping lucases .
i shall not sport with your impatience ,  by reading what he says on that point .
what relates to yourself ,  is as follows :  having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event ,  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ;  of which we have been advertised by the same authority .
your daughter elizabeth ,  it is presumed ,  will not long bear the name of bennet ,  after her elder sister has resigned it ,  and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess ,  lizzy ,  who is meant by this ?
this young gentleman is blessed ,  in a peculiar way ,  with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire ,  — splendid property ,  noble kindred ,  and extensive patronage .
yet in spite of all these temptations ,  let me warn my cousin elizabeth ,  and yourself ,  of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals ,  which ,  of course ,  you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea ,  lizzy ,  who this gentleman is ?
but now it comes out :  my motive for cautioning you is as follows .
we have reason to imagine that his aunt ,  lady catherine de bourgh ,  does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr .
darcy ,  you see ,  is the man !
now ,  lizzy ,  i think i have surprised you .
could he ,  or the lucases ,  have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance ,  whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?
mr. darcy ,  who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish ,  and who probably never looked at you in his life !
it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry ,  but could only force one most reluctant smile .
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .
are you not diverted oh !
yes .
pray read on after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night ,  she immediately ,  with her usual condescension ,  expressed what she felt on the occasion ;  when it became apparent ,  that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin ,  she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin ,  that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about ,  and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr. collins moreover adds ,  i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up ,  and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known .
i must not ,  however ,  neglect the duties of my station ,  or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .
it was an encouragement of vice ;  and had i been the rector of longbourn ,  i should very strenuously have opposed it .
you ought certainly to forgive them ,  as a christian ,  but never to admit them in your sight ,  or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness !
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation ,  and his expectation of a young olivebranch .
but ,  lizzy ,  you look as if you did not enjoy it .
you are not going to be missish ,  i hope ,  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .
for what do we live ,  but to make sport for our neighbours ,  and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth ,  i am excessively diverted .
but it is so strange yes — that is what makes it amusing .
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ;  but his perfect indifference ,  and your pointed dislike ,  make it so delightfully absurd !
much as i abominate writing ,  i would not give up mr. collinss correspondence for any consideration .
nay ,  when i read a letter of his ,  i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham ,  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw .
and pray ,  lizzy ,  what said lady catherine about this report ?
did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ;  and as it had been asked without the least suspicion ,  she was not distressed by his repeating it .
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .
it was necessary to laugh ,  when she would rather have cried .
her father had most cruelly mortified her ,  by what he said of mr. darcys indifference ,  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration ,  or fear that perhaps ,  instead of his seeing too little ,  she might have fancied too much .
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend ,  as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do ,  he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit .
the gentlemen arrived early ;  and ,  before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt ,  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread ,  bingley ,  who wanted to be alone with jane ,  proposed their all walking out .
it was agreed to .
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking ;  mary could never spare time ;  but the remaining five set off together .
bingley and jane ,  however ,  soon allowed the others to outstrip them .
they lagged behind ,  while elizabeth ,  kitty ,  and darcy were to entertain each other .
very little was said by either ;  kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ;  elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ;  and perhaps he might be doing the same .
they walked towards the lucases ,  because kitty wished to call upon maria ;  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern ,  when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone .
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ,  and ,  while her courage was high ,  she immediately said :  mr .
darcy ,  i am a very selfish creature ;  and ,  for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings ,  care not how much i may be wounding yours .
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .
ever since i have known it ,  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
were it known to the rest of my family ,  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry ,  exceedingly sorry ,  replied darcy ,  in a tone of surprise and emotion ,  that you have ever been informed of what may ,  in a mistaken light ,  have given you uneasiness .
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt .
lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ;  and ,  of course ,  i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
let me thank you again and again ,  in the name of all my family ,  for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble ,  and bear so many mortifications ,  for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me ,  he replied ,  let it be for yourself alone .
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on ,  i shall not attempt to deny .
but your family owe me nothing .
much as i respect them ,  i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
after a short pause ,  her companion added ,  you are too generous to trifle with me .
if your feelings are still what they were last april ,  tell me so at once .
my affections and wishes are unchanged ,  but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth ,  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation ,  now forced herself to speak ;  and immediately ,  though not very fluently ,  gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change ,  since the period to which he alluded ,  as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
the happiness which this reply produced ,  was such as he had probably never felt before ;  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye ,  she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight ,  diffused over his face ,  became him ;  but ,  though she could not look ,  she could listen ,  and he told her of feelings ,  which ,  in proving of what importance she was to him ,  made his affection every moment more valuable .
they walked on ,  without knowing in what direction .
there was too much to be thought ,  and felt ,  and said ,  for attention to any other objects .
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt ,  who did call on him in her return through london ,  and there relate her journey to longbourn ,  its motive ,  and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ;  dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which ,  in her ladyships apprehension ,  peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance ;  in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give .
but ,  unluckily for her ladyship ,  its effect had been exactly contrariwise .
it taught me to hope ,  said he ,  as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that ,  had you been absolutely ,  irrevocably decided against me ,  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine ,  frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied ,  yes ,  you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .
after abusing you so abominably to your face ,  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me ,  that i did not deserve ?
for ,  though your accusations were illfounded ,  formed on mistaken premises ,  my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof .
it was unpardonable .
i cannot think of it without abhorrence we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening ,  said elizabeth .
the conduct of neither ,  if strictly examined ,  will be irreproachable ;  but since then ,  we have both ,  i hope ,  improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .
the recollection of what i then said ,  of my conduct ,  my manners ,  my expressions during the whole of it ,  is now ,  and has been many months ,  inexpressibly painful to me .
your reproof ,  so well applied ,  i shall never forget :  had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words .
you know not ,  you can scarcely conceive ,  how they have tortured me ;  — though it was some time ,  i confess ,  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it .
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling ,  i am sure you did .
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget ,  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh !
do not repeat what i then said .
these recollections will not do at all .
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it darcy mentioned his letter .
did it ,  said he ,  did it soon make you think better of me ?
did you ,  on reading it ,  give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been ,  and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .
i knew ,  said he ,  that what i wrote must give you pain ,  but it was necessary .
i hope you have destroyed the letter .
there was one part especially ,  the opening of it ,  which i should dread your having the power of reading again .
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt ,  if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ;  but ,  though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable ,  they are not ,  i hope ,  quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter ,  replied darcy ,  i believed myself perfectly calm and cool ,  but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter ,  perhaps ,  began in bitterness ,  but it did not end so .
the adieu is charity itself .
but think no more of the letter .
the feelings of the person who wrote ,  and the person who received it ,  are now so widely different from what they were then ,  that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten .
you must learn some of my philosophy .
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach ,  that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy ,  but ,  what is much better ,  of innocence .
but with me ,  it is not so .
painful recollections will intrude which cannot ,  which ought not ,  to be repelled .
i have been a selfish being all my life ,  in practice ,  though not in principle .
as a child i was taught what was right ,  but i was not taught to correct my temper .
i was given good principles ,  but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child ,  i was spoilt by my parents ,  who ,  though good themselves my father ,  particularly ,  all that was benevolent and amiable ,  allowed ,  encouraged ,  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ;  to care for none beyond my own family circle ;  to think meanly of all the rest of the world ;  to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .
such i was ,  from eight to eight and twenty ;  and such i might still have been but for you ,  dearest ,  loveliest elizabeth !
what do i not owe you !
you taught me a lesson ,  hard indeed at first ,  but most advantageous .
by you ,  i was properly humbled .
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had .
what will you think of my vanity ?
i believed you to be wishing ,  expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault ,  but not intentionally ,  i assure you .
i never meant to deceive you ,  but my spirits might often lead me wrong .
how you must have hated me after that evening hate you !
i was angry perhaps at first ,  but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ,  when we met at pemberley .
you blamed me for coming no indeed ;  i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness ,  and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then ,  replied darcy ,  was to show you ,  by every civility in my power ,  that i was not so mean as to resent the past ;  and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness ,  to lessen your ill opinion ,  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell ,  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance ,  and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ;  which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption ,  she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn ,  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .
she expressed her gratitude again ,  but it was too painful a subject to each ,  to be dwelt on farther .
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner ,  and too busy to know anything about it ,  they found at last ,  on examining their watches ,  that it was time to be at home .
what could become of mr. bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .
darcy was delighted with their engagement ;  his friend had given him the earliest information of it .
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth .
not at all .
when i went away ,  i felt that it would soon happen that is to say ,  you had given your permission .
i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term ,  she found that it had been pretty much the case .
on the evening before my going to london ,  said he ,  i made a confession to him ,  which i believe i ought to have made long ago .
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
his surprise was great .
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
i told him ,  moreover ,  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing ,  as i had done ,  that your sister was indifferent to him ;  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated ,  i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .
did you speak from your own observation ,  said she ,  when you told him that my sister loved him ,  or merely from my information last spring from the former .
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here ;  and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it ,  i suppose ,  carried immediate conviction to him it did .
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case ,  but his reliance on mine made every thing easy .
i was obliged to confess one thing ,  which for a time ,  and not unjustly ,  offended him .
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter ,  that i had known it ,  and purposely kept it from him .
he was angry .
but his anger ,  i am persuaded ,  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments .
he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ;  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ;  but she checked herself .
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at ,  and it was rather too early to begin .
in anticipating the happiness of bingley ,  which of course was to be inferior only to his own ,  he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
in the hall they parted .
my dear lizzy ,  where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room ,  and from all the others when they sat down to table .
she had only to say in reply ,  that they had wandered about ,  till she was beyond her own knowledge .
she coloured as she spoke ;  but neither that ,  nor anything else ,  awakened a suspicion of the truth .
the evening passed quietly ,  unmarked by anything extraordinary .
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed ,  the unacknowledged were silent .
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ;  and elizabeth ,  agitated and confused ,  rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so ;  for ,  besides the immediate embarrassment ,  there were other evils before her .
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ;  she was aware that no one liked him but jane ;  and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .
at night she opened her heart to jane .
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits ,  she was absolutely incredulous here .
you are joking ,  lizzy .
this cannot be — engaged to mr. darcy !
no ,  no ,  you shall not deceive me .
i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed !
my sole dependence was on you ;  and i am sure nobody else will believe me ,  if you do not .
yet ,  indeed ,  i am in earnest .
i speak nothing but the truth .
he still loves me ,  and we are engaged jane looked at her doubtingly .
oh ,  lizzy !
it cannot be .
i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter .
that is all to be forgot .
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .
but in such cases as these ,  a good memory is unpardonable .
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennet still looked all amazement .
elizabeth again ,  and more seriously assured her of its truth .
good heaven !
can it be really so !
yet now i must believe you ,  cried jane .
my dear ,  dear lizzy ,  i would — i do congratulate you — but are you certain ?
forgive the question — are you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that .
it is settled between us already ,  that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
but are you pleased ,  jane ?
shall you like to have such a brother very ,  very much .
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .
but we considered it ,  we talked of it as impossible .
and do you really love him quite well enough ?
oh ,  lizzy !
do anything rather than marry without affection .
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh ,  yes !
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do ,  when i tell you all what do you mean why ,  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley .
i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister ,  now be serious .
i want to talk very seriously .
let me know every thing that i am to know ,  without delay .
will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually ,  that i hardly know when it began .
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another entreaty that she would be serious ,  however ,  produced the desired effect ;  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
when convinced on that article ,  miss bennet had nothing further to wish .
now i am quite happy ,  said she ,  for you will be as happy as myself .
i always had a value for him .
were it for nothing but his love of you ,  i must always have esteemed him ;  but now ,  as bingleys friend and your husband ,  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .
but lizzy ,  you have been very sly ,  very reserved with me .
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
i owe all that i know of it to another ,  not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ;  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage .
all was acknowledged ,  and half the night spent in conversation .
good gracious cried mrs. bennet ,  as she stood at a window the next morning ,  if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?
i had no notion but he would go ashooting ,  or something or other ,  and not disturb us with his company .
what shall we do with him ?
lizzy ,  you must walk out with him again ,  that he may not be in bingleys way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ;  yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
as soon as they entered ,  bingley looked at her so expressively ,  and shook hands with such warmth ,  as left no doubt of his good information ;  and he soon afterwards said aloud ,  mrs .
bennet ,  have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today i advise mr. darcy ,  and lizzy ,  and kitty ,  said mrs. bennet ,  to walk to oakham mount this morning .
it is a nice long walk ,  and mr. darcy has never seen the view it may do very well for the others ,  replied mr. bingley ;  but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .
wont it ,  kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount ,  and elizabeth silently consented .
as she went up stairs to get ready ,  mrs. bennet followed her ,  saying :  i am quite sorry ,  lizzy ,  that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .
but i hope you will not mind it :  it is all for janes sake ,  you know ;  and there is no occasion for talking to him ,  except just now and then .
so ,  do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk ,  it was resolved that mr. bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers .
she could not determine how her mother would take it ;  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
but whether she were violently set against the match ,  or violently delighted with it ,  it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ;  and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy ,  than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .
in the evening ,  soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library ,  she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him ,  and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .
she did not fear her fathers opposition ,  but he was going to be made unhappy ;  and that it should be through her means — that she ,  his favourite child ,  should be distressing him by her choice ,  should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her — was a wretched reflection ,  and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again ,  when ,  looking at him ,  she was a little relieved by his smile .
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ;  and ,  while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper ,  go to your father ,  he wants you in the library she was gone directly .
her father was walking about the room ,  looking grave and anxious .
lizzy ,  said he ,  what are you doing ?
are you out of your senses ,  to be accepting this man ?
have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable ,  her expressions more moderate !
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ;  but they were now necessary ,  and she assured him ,  with some confusion ,  of her attachment to mr. darcy .
or ,  in other words ,  you are determined to have him .
he is rich ,  to be sure ,  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .
but will they make you happy have you any other objection ,  said elizabeth ,  than your belief of my indifference none at all .
we all know him to be a proud ,  unpleasant sort of man ;  but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do ,  i do like him ,  she replied ,  with tears in her eyes ,  i love him .
indeed he has no improper pride .
he is perfectly amiable .
you do not know what he really is ;  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms lizzy ,  said her father ,  i have given him my consent .
he is the kind of man ,  indeed ,  to whom i should never dare refuse anything ,  which he condescended to ask .
i now give it to you ,  if you are resolved on having him .
but let me advise you to think better of it .
i know your disposition ,  lizzy .
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable ,  unless you truly esteemed your husband ;  unless you looked up to him as a superior .
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .
my child ,  let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .
you know not what you are about elizabeth ,  still more affected ,  was earnest and solemn in her reply ;  and at length ,  by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice ,  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone ,  relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day ,  but had stood the test of many months suspense ,  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities ,  she did conquer her fathers incredulity ,  and reconcile him to the match .
well ,  my dear ,  said he ,  when she ceased speaking ,  i have no more to say .
if this be the case ,  he deserves you .
i could not have parted with you ,  my lizzy ,  to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression ,  she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
he heard her with astonishment .
this is an evening of wonders ,  indeed !
and so ,  darcy did every thing ;  made up the match ,  gave the money ,  paid the fellows debts ,  and got him his commission !
so much the better .
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .
had it been your uncles doing ,  i must and would have paid him ;  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
i shall offer to pay him tomorrow ;  he will rant and storm about his love for you ,  and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before ,  on his reading mr. collinss letter ;  and after laughing at her some time ,  allowed her at last to go — saying ,  as she quitted the room ,  if any young men come for mary or kitty ,  send them in ,  for i am quite at leisure elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ;  and ,  after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room ,  she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .
every thing was too recent for gaiety ,  but the evening passed tranquilly away ;  there was no longer anything material to be dreaded ,  and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night ,  she followed her ,  and made the important communication .
its effect was most extraordinary ;  for on first hearing it ,  mrs. bennet sat quite still ,  and unable to utter a syllable .
nor was it under many ,  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard ;  though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family ,  or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .
she began at length to recover ,  to fidget about in her chair ,  get up ,  sit down again ,  wonder ,  and bless herself .
good gracious !
lord bless me !
only think !
dear me !
mr. darcy !
who would have thought it !
and is it really true ?
oh !
my sweetest lizzy !
how rich and how great you will be !
what pinmoney ,  what jewels ,  what carriages you will have !
janes is nothing to it — nothing at all .
i am so pleased — so happy .
such a charming man — so handsome !
so tall — oh ,  my dear lizzy !
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .
i hope he will overlook it .
dear ,  dear lizzy .
a house in town !
every thing that is charming !
three daughters married !
ten thousand a year !
oh ,  lord !
what will become of me .
i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted :  and elizabeth ,  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself ,  soon went away .
but before she had been three minutes in her own room ,  her mother followed her .
my dearest child ,  she cried ,  i can think of nothing else !
ten thousand a year ,  and very likely more !
tis as good as a lord !
and a special licence .
you must and shall be married by a special licence .
but my dearest love ,  tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of ,  that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ;  and elizabeth found that ,  though in the certain possession of his warmest affection ,  and secure of her relations consent ,  there was still something to be wished for .
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ;  for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him ,  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention ,  or mark her deference for his opinion .
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ;  and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly ,  said he .
wickham ,  perhaps ,  is my favourite ;  but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again ,  she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
how could you begin said she .
i can comprehend your going on charmingly ,  when you had once made a beginning ;  but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour ,  or the spot ,  or the look ,  or the words ,  which laid the foundation .
it is too long ago .
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early withstood ,  and as for my manners — my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil ,  and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .
now be sincere ;  did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind ,  i did you may as well call it impertinence at once .
it was very little less .
the fact is ,  that you were sick of civility ,  of deference ,  of officious attention .
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking ,  and looking ,  and thinking for your approbation alone .
i roused ,  and interested you ,  because i was so unlike them .
had you not been really amiable ,  you would have hated me for it ;  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself ,  your feelings were always noble and just ;  and in your heart ,  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .
there — i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ;  and really ,  all things considered ,  i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .
to be sure ,  you knew no actual good of me — but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane !
who could have done less for her ?
but make a virtue of it by all means .
my good qualities are under your protection ,  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ;  and ,  in return ,  it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ;  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .
what made you so shy of me ,  when you first called ,  and afterwards dined here ?
why ,  especially ,  when you called ,  did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent ,  and gave me no encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less ,  might how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give ,  and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
but i wonder how long you would have gone on ,  if you had been left to yourself .
i wonder when you would have spoken ,  if i had not asked you !
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .
too much ,  i am afraid ;  for what becomes of the moral ,  if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ?
for i ought not to have mentioned the subject .
this will never do you need not distress yourself .
the moral will be perfectly fair .
lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts .
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours .
my aunts intelligence had given me hope ,  and i was determined at once to know every thing lady catherine has been of infinite use ,  which ought to make her happy ,  for she loves to be of use .
but tell me ,  what did you come down to netherfield for ?
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?
or had you intended any more serious consequence my real purpose was to see you ,  and to judge ,  if i could ,  whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
my avowed one ,  or what i avowed to myself ,  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley ,  and if she were ,  to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want more time than courage ,  elizabeth .
but it ought to be done ,  and if you will give me a sheet of paper ,  it shall be done directly and if i had not a letter to write myself ,  i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing ,  as another young lady once did .
but i have an aunt ,  too ,  who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been overrated ,  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiners long letter ;  but now ,  having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome ,  she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness ,  and immediately wrote as follows :  i would have thanked you before ,  my dear aunt ,  as i ought to have done ,  for your long ,  kind ,  satisfactory ,  detail of particulars ;  but to say the truth ,  i was too cross to write .
you supposed more than really existed .
but now suppose as much as you choose ;  give a loose rein to your fancy ,  indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford ,  and unless you believe me actually married ,  you cannot greatly err .
you must write again very soon ,  and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .
i thank you ,  again and again ,  for not going to the lakes .
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
your idea of the ponies is delightful .
we will go round the park every day .
i am the happiest creature in the world .
perhaps other people have said so before ,  but not one with such justice .
i am happier even than jane ;  she only smiles ,  i laugh .
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me .
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .
yours ,  etc mr. darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style ;  and still different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins ,  in reply to his last .
dear sir ,  i must trouble you once more for congratulations .
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .
console lady catherine as well as you can .
but ,  if i were you ,  i would stand by the nephew .
he has more to give .
yours sincerely ,  etc miss bingleys congratulations to her brother ,  on his approaching marriage ,  were all that was affectionate and insincere .
she wrote even to jane on the occasion ,  to express her delight ,  and repeat all her former professions of regard .
jane was not deceived ,  but she was affected ;  and though feeling no reliance on her ,  could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information ,  was as sincere as her brothers in sending it .
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight ,  and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins ,  or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife ,  the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter ,  that charlotte ,  really rejoicing in the match ,  was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .
at such a moment ,  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth ,  though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought ,  when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .
he bore it ,  however ,  with admirable calmness .
he could even listen to sir william lucas ,  when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country ,  and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st .
jamess ,  with very decent composure .
if he did shrug his shoulders ,  it was not till sir william was out of sight .
mrs. phillipss vulgarity was another ,  and perhaps a greater ,  tax on his forbearance ;  and though mrs. phillips ,  as well as her sister ,  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged ,  yet ,  whenever she did speak ,  she must be vulgar .
nor was her respect for him ,  though it made her more quiet ,  at all likely to make her more elegant .
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either ,  and was ever anxious to keep him to herself ,  and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ;  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure ,  it added to the hope of the future ;  and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either ,  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley ,  and talked of mrs. darcy ,  may be guessed .
i wish i could say ,  for the sake of her family ,  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible ,  amiable ,  wellinformed woman for the rest of her life ;  though perhaps it was lucky for her husband ,  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form ,  that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ;  his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do .
he delighted in going to pemberley ,  especially when he was least expected .
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper ,  or her affectionate heart .
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ;  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire ,  and jane and elizabeth ,  in addition to every other source of happiness ,  were within thirty miles of each other .
kitty ,  to her very material advantage ,  spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .
in society so superior to what she had generally known ,  her improvement was great .
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia ;  and ,  removed from the influence of lydias example ,  she became ,  by proper attention and management ,  less irritable ,  less ignorant ,  and less insipid .
from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept ,  and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her ,  with the promise of balls and young men ,  her father would never consent to her going .
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ;  and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennets being quite unable to sit alone .
mary was obliged to mix more with the world ,  but she could still moralize over every morning visit ;  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own ,  it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .
as for wickham and lydia ,  their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ;  and in spite of every thing ,  was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage ,  explained to her that ,  by his wife at least ,  if not by himself ,  such a hope was cherished .
the letter was to this effect :  my dear lizzy ,  i wish you joy .
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham ,  you must be very happy .
it is a great comfort to have you so rich ,  and when you have nothing else to do ,  i hope you will think of us .
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much ,  and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .
any place would do ,  of about three or four hundred a year ;  but however ,  do not speak to mr. darcy about it ,  if you had rather not .
yours ,  etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not ,  she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind .
such relief ,  however ,  as it was in her power to afford ,  by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences ,  she frequently sent them .
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs ,  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants ,  and heedless of the future ,  must be very insufficient to their support ;  and whenever they changed their quarters ,  either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .
their manner of living ,  even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home ,  was unsettled in the extreme .
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation ,  and always spending more than they ought .
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ;  hers lasted a little longer ;  and in spite of her youth and her manners ,  she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley ,  yet ,  for elizabeths sake ,  he assisted him further in his profession .
lydia was occasionally a visitor there ,  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ;  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long ,  that even bingleys good humour was overcome ,  and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage ;  but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley ,  she dropt all her resentment ;  was fonder than ever of georgiana ,  almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore ,  and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .
pemberley was now georgianas home ;  and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended .
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ;  though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively ,  sportive ,  manner of talking to her brother .
he ,  who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection ,  she now saw the object of open pleasantry .
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .
by elizabeths instructions ,  she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ;  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement ,  she sent him language so very abusive ,  especially of elizabeth ,  that for some time all intercourse was at an end .
but at length ,  by elizabeths persuasion ,  he was prevailed on to overlook the offence ,  and seek a reconciliation ;  and ,  after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt ,  her resentment gave way ,  either to her affection for him ,  or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ;  and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley ,  in spite of that pollution which its woods had received ,  not merely from the presence of such a mistress ,  but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .
with the gardiners ,  they were always on the most intimate terms .
darcy ,  as well as elizabeth ,  really loved them ;  and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who ,  by bringing her into derbyshire ,  had been the means of uniting them .
